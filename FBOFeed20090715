<DESC><p>The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin Air Force Base, FL intends to solicit, negotiate and award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the acquisition of a Vacuum and Air Handling System. Quantity: 1 Each. Description: The vacuum system for the High Pressure Particulate Physics Facility in Building 9633 is to be used for basic research into shock compression of condensed matter, basic fracture mechanics, and multiphase reactive flow. The vacuum will be attached to a 400 cubic feet steel tank in which the experiments will be conducted. In the field of shock compression of condensed matter, the vacuum will be used to remove the column of air, which would normally pre-compress the material of interest. The removal of the air column will allow our investigations to be extremely precise (in the millradians of planarity, nanosecond time resolution, and micron particle size). In fracture mechanics, the vacuum will be used to investigate the decomposition of matter into fragments in the absence of air. In this way, any light radiation can be eliminated from our diagnostics, since air provides the oxygen required for combustion. In multiphase reactive flow, the vacuum will be used to diagnose the ejects from an impact just prior to combustion. Therefore, a vacuum system that can hold 2-10 millitorr of vacuum in 30 minutes or less is required for these studies. The vacuum must be oil free, such that any oil particles do not contaminate the tank or our samples prior to testing, or create a combustible environment in which fine oil particles are suspended in the tank. The vacuum and air handling system is to be built with commercial items components. This is one time purchase that requires installation and testing. The system will be delivered and installed in Bldg. 9633, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542. This requirement will be 100 percent set aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for acquisition is 333911 with a Size Standard of 500 employees. A solicitation in a form of a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued and posted in FBO www.fbo.gov 10 days after the release of this notice. The solicitation will identify the technical requirements, specifications and additional information. There will be a site visit. Award will be made to one responsive and responsible offeror. All small business responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The contractors submitting a proposal must be CCR registered. To register in CCR, visit the website www.ccr.gov. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The Energy Research Group of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in collaboration with the Technical Directorate of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a municipal waste stream of degradable organic waste within a high solids inflow to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited in a landfill from an Air Force installation.
<p>The Air Force is interested in demonstrating how biogas from anaerobic digestion of organic waste can be used to offset bioreactor operating expenses or enhance aerobic decomposition of waste for the following purposes: 1) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 2) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost); and 3) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills. A crucial element of the research and development approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Influent municipal waste solids would include glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic constituents. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment.</p>
<p>Anticipated total program funding is $5.832M with multiple awards possible.</p>

<DESC>ARC is requesting Fifteen (15) T5 shock tunnel runs, testing services and datareports to support NASAs Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Aerosciences Project. Thesetests will provide T5 Shock Tunnel calibration, including freestream pitot pressure and nozzle static pressure. Caltech will document the test conditions and provide the data ina final report. These calibration data are required to assess and quantify theuncertainty of previous T5 Shock Tunnel real gas heat transfer and aerodynamic data usedin the CEV flight aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic database. The data will also be usedto valifate the CFD codes used to generate the flight databases. Delivery to NASA ARC is required as follows: 1) a preliminary data report no later thanAugust 15, 2009 that freestream pitot pressure and nozzle static pressure with error barsand facility operating conditions for all shots completed. 2) A draft of the final testreport no later than September 1, 2009 that includes the results and analysis of thecalibration data with error bars and facility operating conditions; 3) a final testreport no later than September 15, 2009 that includes the complete set of calibrationdata with error bars, and facility operating conditions. Additionally, close coordination with ARC is necessary as the data provided by the vendormust be analyzed and integrated for use in the CEV flight aerodynamic andaerothermodynamic databases. The vendor must be able to accommodate ARCs requirement toallow the Government to witness the testing, as needed. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the testing and analysis services from the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology. The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (a) (1) onlyone responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agencyrequirements. Based on NASAs market survey, Caltech is the only source capable offufilling the requirements, given the schedule constraints and the need for closecoordination with ARC. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform thiseffort in writing to the identified point of contact Rachel Khattab not later than 12:00noon PST on or before July 21,2009. Such capabilities and/or qualifications will beevaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete thisproposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this noticeis solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA specific note B. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), Yuma Desalting Plant, Yuma, Arizona, 85364, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Separation Systems Technology (SST), 4901 Moreno Boulevard, Suite 809, San Diego CA  92117-7325. The requirement is for procurement of membrane development services to generate novel membranes (which currently do not exist) to purify water through the process of forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO).  These newly-developed membranes will be evaluated for possible use in the Yuma Desalting Plant. The purpose of the services being procured is to develop and investigate these novel membranes as part of an integrated operating process.  The transaction is unusual for several reasons:
-- Over a period of years, the government has invested significant amounts of funding in the research/development of the membranes to be developed, and the processes are close to completion;
-- The government and this company co-share a patent application (US 2008/0277333 A1), and have mutual interests in developing this technology; 
-- No membranes currently on the market provide the required features of the membranes to be developed;
-- The primary inventor/developer has extensive technical background and more than 30 years experience in membrane development, thus is near or at retirement age.
The proposed contractor, SST, has been working with membrane development for more than 30 years.  SST's company owner directed the research department for one of the companies that supplied the YDP's original membrane elements, thus has the familiarity with the YDP operating processes, equipment, and conditions.  
Competition is restricted to only one source per FAR 6.302-1.  This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 15 Negotiation procedures with an intended service period of 4 Years.  Anticipated award date is August 31, 2009.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal by 2 p.m., local time (Arizona), July 30, 2009, which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses to this notice shall be faxed to Myra Cordero, Contract Specialist at 928-343-8568 or via email to mcordero@usbr.gov

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Marion, South Carolina, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,800 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,145 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy by January 1, 2010. The delineated area is bounded on the North by Jones Avenue/Senator Gasque Rd; on the East by Lipscomb Rd; on the South by Highway 76/301; and on the West by Highway 501. Other applicable requirements include:

- First floor space preferred
- Parking (number of on site, reserved spaces (structured vs. surface) for official
Government vehicles, drive-thru parking)
- Security (i.e., lobby, parking, setbacks etc, where and as applicable)
- Others.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  Anyone interested should call Jim Bedell at 843-423-1341, Ext 2.  Final date to inquire about the solicitation is August 5, 2009.

PA has developed a distribution strategy that includes streaming and video blogging on state.gov, digital video encoding to YouTube, and contracts with thenewsmarket.com, and Pathfire, the two leading internet-based, global providers of video clips to news broadcasters.  The current capacity for this distribution is not meeting the daily demands, and requires doubling the capability just to get to an adequate level of output. Additional increases in media distribution strategies with the regional broadcast hubs across the globe, as well as media support for regional bureaus and posts requires PA to significantly increase our multimedia and multiformatting capabilities.    PA/OBS needs to expedite the delivery of this content to improve global audience reach and 2nd party placement of DOS video clips.   The timely and widespread delivery of this content is a critical success factor in communicating foreign policy and American values to a global audience.
The State Departments broadcast television production facility is a unique, state-of-the-art hybrid digital/analog platform that includes custom designed equipment for specialized applications. Telestream is the manufacturer and systems integrator of the specialized hardware and software that works together with other studio equipment to for digital video encoding and file transfer to external servers.  Telestream is the only company that can enable PA to increase this capacity without re-designing and re-integrating additional equipment at a greater expense for a new digital workflow, and its hardware and software allows for encoding to a diverse range of formats for use all over the world. The Department proposes to enter into this contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (1) only one available source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Departments requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The solicitation for this project will be posted to Fed Biz Ops on or about July 30, 2009 with proposals due on August 31, 2009.

This work consists of new road construction (realignment), reconstruction and decommissioning.  The construction and reconstruction is low volume road construction utilizing composite road construction specifications. The project total length is 3.15 miles long and divided into 5 segments.  There will be two base items and three option items.  Clearing shall be moderate to light with chipping and grinding of slash and stumps as the disposal method due to the road being adjacent to the Wild and Scenic North Fork John Day River and recreation the dominant use.  Merchantable timber shall be decked for later disposal by the Government.  Non-merchantable timber will also be decked.  The construction will utilize a large quantity of borrow material and the designed surfacing is grid rolled aggregate.  Both of these materials shall be produced at the Chicken Hill pit approximately 10 miles away (at the junction of 5100 & 5185).  The access is a 2 lane paved highway.  The gradation of select borrow material and grid rolled aggregate is 4 inch minus Jaw Run.  Culverts shall be installed along most of the project.  In some instances existing culverts shall be removed and disposed of.  

The decommissioning shall be included in the total project length and consists of scarification, placement of woody debris in road bed and placement of stump with bole in the road where the river has over flowed.  Also there shall be one 18 inch pipe to remove and two earthen berms to construct.

The road is presently closed to full sized vehicles due to the river washing out the entrance.  Public use will not be allowed during the construction.  The work season is generally between the latter part of June to the latter part of October due to the elevation and snow accumulation.

The project is located on Forest Road 7300 Wallowa Whitman National Forest in Grant County.    From Granite Oregon proceed north on FS road 7300 approximately 9 miles.  At the Junction of FS road 51 (also on the left is the North Ford John Day River Camp Ground) bear right continuing on FS road 7300 approximately 5 miles to the project on the right.  

The estimated cost for this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

The authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  LMATC is the only organization qualified toperform this requirement due to their unique knowledge of the TRACE instrument andoverall science investigation.	LMATC was competitively selected as the PrincipalInvestigator of the TRACE mission over eleven years ago and has been responsible for thedesign, development, integration, test, operation, and scientific data analysis for TRACEsince its inception.  A new contractor would be required to duplicate substantial amountsof effort already undertaken by LMATC.	As a result, unacceptable delays would beincurred during this necessary training period at a time when error-free scienceoperations are required to prevent the loss of critical scientific data.This extended MO&DA phase will be for a period of five (5) months and includesrequirements for science operations planning; monitoring correct instrument status(instrument "health and safety"), and performance; acquiring, disseminating, andanalyzing data; and managing the science investigations, including coordination withinthe TRACE team and liaison with NASA.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Wahn Soo Choi, 159-11 Gaepo-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-240 Korea, for the services as outlined below: 

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-230-DDC. 

Background Information
Mast cells are responsible for a variety of allergic and autoimmune disorders. These cells respond to antigens through clustering of IgE receptors (named Fc&#61541;RI) at the cell surface by multivalent binding of antigen to receptor-bound IgE. This results in release of granules that contain preformed inflammatory mediators and the generation of inflammatory lipids and cytokines to produce the typical symptoms of allergic reactions and mast cell-dependent autoimmune diseases. In addition, mast cells may play a critical role in rapid inflammatory and secondary immune responses to pathogens through co-activation of Fc&#61541;RI and Toll-like receptors in mast cells. These receptors initiate signaling cascades that involve tyrosine kinases, adaptor or docking proteins, as well as enzymes that generate diffusible small messenger molecules that can initiate secondary signaling cascades that eventually lead to the release of inflammatory agents as described above.
Purpose and Objectives
The objective is to elucidate the biochemical signaling pathways that mediate the various responses of mast cells to antigen or TLR ligands.  A complementary objective is to understand how therapeutic agents, especially the glucocorticoids, interrupt signaling processes so as to provide a rational basis for design of more selective agents. In fact, the mast cell is a pre-eminent model for such studies. Most, if not all, known signaling processes can be activated through the various receptors that are expressed on mast cells, some of which act in synergy with Fc&#949;RI such as adenosine receptors and Kit. This permits studies of the influence of other physiologic factors on antigen-induced responses.

Laboratory of Molecular Immunology (LMI) requires the immediate services of an expert cell biologist who has expertise in studies of mast cells to 1) characterize the biochemical signaling responses to antigen, pathogens that activate mast cells, and endogenous factors that amplify such responses; 2) determine the role of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) in early signaling events and in particular its interaction with tyrosine kinases and associated protein partners in membrane lipid rafts; 3) examine in addition such inhibitory modulators as Src-like Adaptor protein (SLAP); and 4) as a corollary determine functional outputs such as degranulation, production of inflammatory lipids (eicosanoids), generation of cytokines, and passive cutaneous anapylaxis (PCA) in vivo. 

Services to be Performed	

General Requirements
Define optimal conditions for growth, expression of receptors for cell activation, and maintenance of phenotype of mast cells derived from precursor cells from mouse bone marrow and of transformed mast cell lines currently in the laboratory. Examine signaling and functional responses to antigen and other agents that augment these responses such as IL-33, Kit ligand, Toll-like receptor ligands.

Specific Requirements
The contractor must have an established record as an independent investigator, and as documented by publications in peer reviewed scientific journals. The contractor must be an expert in the field of mast cell physiology and have specialized technical experience in studies of mast cells (i.e. the culture, sensitization, analysis of signaling processes, and measurement of functional responses such as degranulation and cytokine production). The contractor must have hands-on experience in the manufacture and expression of genetic constructs, RNA interference technology, and all other aspects of molecular biology such as reporter assays, gene chip arrays etc. The contractor must also be capable of performing confocal microscopy to investigate the location and interactions of tagged molecules within live cells. The contractor must also have thorough knowledge of receptor physiology and cell signaling as well as training in medical fields to understand the medical implications of this work.

 
Determine functional responses which include degranulation, production of eicosanoids, and generation of cytokines, the latter by use of real-time PCR, kit arrays, and ELISAs. The eventual aim would be evaluation of findings in vitro in appropriate animal models of anaphylaxis.

Government Requirements
The government will provide on-site laboratory space; furnish all necessary reagents, laboratory equipment, and computer facilities as needed.

Period of performance:  The proposed period of performance for this service July 29, 2009 thru January 29, 2010.  

The estimated level of effort for this requirement is not expected to exceed 1,000 hours during the period of performance.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 10 Center Drive, Clinical Center Building 10 Room 8N109, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology (LMI) intends to facilitate and nurture ongoing collaborative research between NIH and Dr. Choi’s institution.   Due to Dr. Choi’s unique experience in studies of PLD in mast cells in addition to an established record of research with mast cell signaling mechanisms at a molecular and cellular level.  He also has an established record in studies of inhibitors of these signaling mechanisms and of their effect on functional outputs as assessed in cell cultures and animal models. His standing in this regard is attested by his numerous publications (over 80 publications) and academic awards for excellence in research. It is unlikely that anyone else has this combination of experience. His previous studies with human and rodent mast cells in LMI, his resumed participation in the NIH inter-institute Mast Cell meetings held jointly with other NIH laboratories, and his continuing research on mast cells in Korea make him an ideal fit for our research needs at NIH. It should be noted that key procedures used for subsequent studies of PLD in LMI were initially established by Dr. Choi during his previous stay in LMI. His services will ensure continuity of the project at LMI by imparting his extensive skills to others in the laboratory who will continue with complementary lines of research.

<CONTACT>Amy D Bolyard, Contracting Officer, Phone 304-284-7557, Fax 304-284-4839, Email amy.bolyard@wv.usda.gov
<DESC>The project site is located in Randolph County West Virginia 10 miles south of Huttonsville near Kumbrabow State Forest. The construction site for the parking area is located at the Elkwater Fork Dam accessed from US Highway 219 via 2 miles of gravel-surfaced road (County Road 58). Access to the location of the safety boom and boat access-ramp sites will require accessing the site from the upper end of the reservoir by way of approximately 5 miles of County Route 58 (CR 58) from Monterville, West Virginia. The first 1.8 miles of CR 58 are gravel surfaced, but the remaining distance to the dam is unimproved and rough. Access to the upstream side of the dam is not available from the downstream side. 

The required construction work includes the following major work items and approximate quantities: 4,700 cubic yards of excavation; 3,100 cubic yards of earthfill; 170 feet of curb and gutter; 202 square feet of concrete sidewalk; one 30-inch diameter culvert; 170 tons of rock riprap; 228 feet of chain link fence; 2,240 square yards of geotextile fabric; 1,960 feet of silt fence; 150 tons of hot-mix asphalt (WVDOH Spec); 380 tons of crushed aggregate base; 685 feet of hiking trail; and a 650 foot safety boom. The project also contains other minor and incidental work items, including traffic signs, bollards, fish habitat improvements, pollution control, and two security gates. 

The project will provide an asphalt parking area below the Elkwater Fork dam; a small boat ramp and gravel-surfaced parking area at the upper end of the future reservoir; a lakeside hiking trail; a new wetland area; and minor improvements to the County Road 58 access road. The safety boom will stretch across the width of the future reservoir to deter boaters from getting too close to the face of the dam. 

Portions of the CR 58 access road are rutted, rocky, and steep with no gravel surfacing. Minor road improvements, as required for construction access, are required. These improvements may include grading, surfacing, drainage improvements, turnouts, and possibly the use of the appropriate equipment to tow or push other equipment to the site. The successful bidder will be responsible for getting all construction equipment, personnel, and materials to the work sites. Additional details for work are included in the bid schedule, design drawings, and construction specifications.

The estimated price range for this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  The required performance time is 302 calendar days, which includes a winter shutdown.  The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued on, or about July 30, 2009.  A Site Showing will be held on Wednesday, August 12, 2009; the time and location will be specified in the posted Solicitation Package on July 30th.  

Interested offerors may register at www.fbo.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading.  All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the agency.

PLEASE NOTE:  The General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons.  Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps website for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to seek proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing services to “Liberia Energy Sector Support Program”. 

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of organization (U. S. or non-U.S., large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organization) is eligible to compete.  

USAID plans to award a four year cost reimbursement plus fixed fee completion-type contract with a total estimated cost in the range of $18,000,000 – 20,000,000 covering a total estimated period of four years. Revealing the estimated range for the contract does not mean that offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated.  Offerors  must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost Proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award.

This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about July 21, 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The antigenic component of this vaccine is a single protein produced from a fusion of the Yersinia pestis genes for the F1 capsular protein and the V virulence protein.   The product is currently being investigated in the U.S. under a DVC sponsored IND.   As the efficacy of this vaccine cannot be tested in humans, it is essential to develop in vivo and in vitro surrogate assays that are valid predictors of immunity.<BR><BR>An assay was developed at USAMRIID based upon the observation that infection of macrophage cultures with Yersinia. pestis (Y. pestis) leads to<BR>apoptotic cell  death.   This cytotoxicity activity may be inhibited with<BR>immune serum.   The functional activity of immune sera obtained from<BR>vaccinated mice  was  tested  in macrophages infected with Y. pestis or Y.<BR>pseduotuberculosis.   Results using microtiter-based assays with adherent<BR>murine-derived  macrophages,  using  the  caspase-3 assay of apoptotic cell death,  provided  a  good  in  vitro  correlate  of  protective immunity in proof-of-concept  studies  conducted  with  the  serum from rF1V vaccinated<BR>mice.   The macrophage cytotoxicity neutralizing activity (CyNA) of anti-V<BR>antibodies  present  in  the  rF1V  immunized  mouse  sera  correlated with<BR>protective immunity  to  lethal  challenge  with  Y.  pestis.   To further<BR>demonstrate the  extent of correlation between in vitro protection against cytotoxic  infection  and  survival from aerosol challenge, serum collected from rF1V vaccinated cynomolgus macaques was also successfully evaluated in the assay.  This assay has been selected for further development and use as an in vitro correlate assay of protection of rF1V-vaccinated humans.<BR><BR>DVC is seeking the technical services for the assay technology transfer, method optimization, qualification and validation.  The technical services are also required for the testing of nonclinical and/or clinical sera samples for cytotoxicity neutralizing activity.<BR><BR>If you are interested in receiving a copy of this solicitation, please<BR>contact:   Jo Ann Brown, Principal Subcontract Administrator,  DVC, LLC, a<BR>CSC company at jbrown253@csc.com<BR><BR>Please only contact the person noted above and not the USASMDC office listed in this announcement.<BR>

<DESC>The Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General (DHS-OIG) is conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This request for information (RFI) is being posted to obtain information from 8(a) vendors with the interest and capabilities to perform a broad range of Administrative Investigations.

Administrative investigations shall be performed in accordance with federal regulations, guidance provided by DHS-OIG, Office of Investigations Special Agent Handbook (SAH), January, 2006; and in accordance with the President’s 
Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) Quality Standards for Investigations, December, 2003, (http://www.ignet.gov/pande/standards/invstds.pdf).

The following items are the types of Administrative Investigation services that DHS-OIG may require.  The scope of each task order will describe specific information for each investigation.

Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations – Services to be provided under Equal Employment Opportunity investigations category include, but are not limited to, disputes regarding employment related matters. 

Human Resource Investigations – Services to be provided under the Human Resource Investigations category include, but are not limited to, non-criminal employee misconduct, misuse of a Government property or vehicle, ethics violations, low level theft, potentially prohibited personnel practices, etc.

Other Non-Criminal Investigations – Services to be provided under the Other Non-Criminal Investigations category include, but are not limited to, failure to follow procedures, driving under the influence, etc.


DELIVERABLES

All deliverables are subject to review and approval by DHS-OIG.  The Contractor shall work with the DHS-OIG to resolve any quality/requirement issues with these deliverables without additional cost.  Any issues that cannot be resolved shall be referred to the contract administrator.  Examples of deliverables associated with services described in this performance work statement are:

Pre-Investigation Conference
The Contractor Investigator shall attend a Pre-Investigation Conference lead by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and Special Agent in Charge (SAC) to discuss the allegations to be investigated and the specific investigative activity to be conducted. Pre-Investigative conference will be documented in a memorandum prepared by the Contract Investigator.

Engagement Letters
The Contract Investigator will prepare a notification memorandum for the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations (AIGI) signature advising the DHS component point of contact that the DHS-OIG Contract Investigator will be conducting an investigation on behalf of the DHS-OIG. This memorandum will contain a brief summary of the allegations, and include contact information for the Contract Investigator and the DHS-OIG COTR. 

Investigative Plan
The Investigative Plan provides an outline of the allegations, summarizes the intended investigative activity, and serves as a guide for the Contract Investigator to follow as the investigation progresses.

The Investigative Plan is to be prepared by the Contract Investigator before any investigative activity is conducted or initiated.  The Investigative Plan should include the predicate information; the relevant complaint(s)/allegation(s); the applicable rules and regulations; the anticipated investigative activities; the estimated date of completion. The plan will be approved by the SAC and COTR before fieldwork begins. Any substantive changes to the Investigative Plan will require the pre-approval of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)-SAC and documented in writing.

Investigative Interviews and Statements
The Contract Investigator will use the interview guidelines and methods provided in the DHS-OIG Special Agent Handbook, Chapter 9, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) Quality Standards for Investigations and generally accepted professional standards for the federal Government.

Subject Interviews
The Contract Investigator will use the subject interview guidelines and methods provided in the DHS-OIG Special Agent Handbook, Chapter 10 and CIGIE Quality Standards for Investigations.

Investigative Methods
The Contract Investigator will use the investigative methods that are identified in the approved investigative plan, the DHS-OIG Special Agent Handbook, and approved by the CFO-SAC. The methods utilized will be appropriate for the non-criminal investigation to be conducted, and no methods will be employed that require prior notification or coordination with the Department of Justice and/or Federal Bureau of Investigations.

Acquisition, Preservation and Management of Evidence
The Contract Investigator will follow all procedures listed in the DHS-OIG Special Agent Handbook, Chapter 16; Federal Criminal Code and Rules, and comply with CIGIE Quality Standards for Investigations.

Memorandum of Activity (MOA)
The Memorandum of Activity (sample memorandum will be provided after the contract is awarded) is a multi-purpose document used for the reporting various types of investigative activity, such as interviews, review of records, and related activities.  Each separate activity or interview will be reported in a separate MOA and will be submitted to the CFO-SAC and COTR within five business days of the activity for approval.

While the Contract Investigator is investigating allegations of administrative misconduct, should the investigation identify allegations of criminal misconduct involving a federal employee, military officer, contractor or civilian, the Contract Investigator is to immediately report this information to the CFO-SAC.  The alleged criminal misconduct is to be documented in a MOA submitted to the CFO-SAC no later than one working day of the discovery of the alleged criminal misconduct. The Contract Investigator is to stop all investigations related to that Investigative Plan. DHS-OIG Investigations will have the option to terminate and not to continue with an investigation. The decision to terminate an investigation at any time will remain with the CFO-SAC.


 
BACKGROUND

The DHS-OIG mission is to serve as an independent and objective inspection, audit, and investigative body to promote effectiveness, efficiency and economy in all DHS programs and operations, and to prevent and detect fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and waste in such programs and operations.

The DHS-OIG Office of Investigations mission is to protect the integrity of DHS programs by investigation allegations of fraud, waste and abuse, and employee misconduct.    These include investigations of grant, program, and contract fraud; and employee misconduct. These include investigations of grant, program and contract fraud; and administrative, civil and criminal violations committed by DHS personnel and other individuals who may impact DHS operations.  Investigations conducted by DHS-OIG Office of Investigations can result in criminal prosecutions, civil monetary penalties, administrative sanctions and personnel actions against wrongdoer and can act as a deterrent for those contemplating fraud against DHS bureaus and agencies.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(A) Price: Relative Importance: 40% All-inclusive price of the Contractor's comprehensive TV video pool feed service (continuous live coverage), seven days (7) per week, including Federal Holidays, for one (1) year <br />(B) Technical Factors:<br />(1) Content of Samples of Submitted Feeds: Relative Importance: 35 %<br />Evaluation of sample feeds and support material of events listed, rundowns/advisories/schedules, of material submitted to reflect the following: <br />(a) Comprehensiveness of coverage must illustrate a broad range of events from the White House, governmental agencies/departments, Capitol Hill, and other news events;<br />(b) Quality of feed must meet commonly accepted broadcast and journalistic standards as indicated herein;<br />(c) The feed material should be continuous, complete from beginning to end and available throughout the day.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance (see FAR 15.304) Relative Importance: 10 %<br />The Offeror shall be regularly engaged in the preparation, production, and dissemination of a daily comprehensive news service, and must be regarded by the broadcast industry as a competent and reliable source of news material.</p>
<p>(3) Offeror's Response to requests and Delivery Mode: Relative Importance 15%<br />Offeror shall have the capability to provide pool material, both domestic and international, at the request of the VOA television assignment desk to meet VOA editorial and programming requirements. Offeror's master control should be staffed 24/7 and available by telephone to coordinate news event switching. If Offeror has the ability to provide remote switching by VOA of the various video sources, this would be considered a desirable option in addition to the telephone coordination. The remote switching capability should allow VOA to make split-second switches from any multiple video sources and feeds. Transmission method of delivery is fiber optic, Offeror, who proposes an alternative delivery means shall be required to submit a detailed description of the system operation, equipment, maintenance, training, and installation schedule. If an alternative deliver method is proposed, Offeror shall provide a detailed explanation of the advantages of its system design and operation versus fiber delivery.</p>
<p>RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OTHER EVALUATION FACTORS, WHEN COMBINED, WHEN COMPARED TO PRICE<br />(A) Price = 40%<br />(B) All Other Factors, when combined, are = 60%<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, Florida has a requirement to procure a broad range of research and development and contractor services to facilitate the customization and application of Live Virtual & Constructive (LVC) technologies (to include Virtual Environment (VE) technologies) to satisfy Navy mission training requirements.  It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract (ID/IQC) will be issued for AIR-46T Live, Virtual, & Constructive Synthetic Training (LVCST) Research and Development. The challenges associated with establishing large-scale LVC distributed networks can be broken down into overlapping broad categories as follows: 1) the live training architecture, 2) the virtual technologies training architecture, 3) the constructive training architecture 4) distributed training, and 5) human computer interaction.  The challenges are increasing as larger, more complex simulation and simulation environments are developed and used in live (i.e., real people using real equipment), virtual (i.e., real people using simulated equipment), and constructive (i.e., simulated people using simulated equipment) environments.  VEs can augment warfighter preparedness by providing training opportunities that might not be available due to factors such as cost, safety, and available resources.  Specific technology challenges associated with VEs include: 1) Develop comprehensive, mixed reality immersive training and mission rehearsal environments, 2) Methods and standards for VE integrated, synchronized environments, 3) Multisensory presentation - visually rich, high-fidelity display augmented with aural, tactile, vestibular, and proprioception cues, 4) Modeling to support realistic, natural interaction among VE participants, 5) Validated methodologies for collaborative training and rehearsal VEs, 6) Web-based VE Training Systems and Develop accepted standards for VE Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A)

The scope includes, but is not limited to, the following tasks:  requirements analysis, engineering design, development and fabrication of government and/or commercial "LVC and VE" technologies, integration of "LVC" data with government displays, and integration of other "Information Technology" (IT) to include computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware, etc., to meet customer requirements.  The tasks will entail a broad range of LVC and VE research in the areas of human factors engineering, systems engineering, and computer hardware/software integration.  The tasks will be focused on the development of improved LVC and VE training technologies and methodologies, and the assessment of the degree to which new LVC and VE training and integration technologies may be applied.  Detailed requirements for the LVC & VE Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) orders will be defined in the Statement of Work (SOW) for each specific Delivery Order/Task Order (DO/TO).  The work will primarily be completed at the contractor's facilities and NAWCTSD.  The highest level of classification that may be encountered while performing DO/TO tasks is SECRET.  The Government estimate for this projected 5 year contract currently does not exceed $9.5 Million.  DO/TO may be issued as either Cost Reimbursable or Firm Fixed Price.

Interested and qualified concerns are invited to submit written responses to this notice by close of business, 30 July 2009.  Electronic responses should be sent to Metrissianne.Rivera@navy.mil.  Responses should include, as a minimum, the following information: (1) Narrative description of current and previous research programs and tasks performed that relate to the research and development areas mentioned above; (2) Specific technical expertise in the research and development areas mentioned above; (3) Technical and managerial qualifications (experience, facilities, staffing, etc.) to include experience in research and development related to Live Virtual & Constructive (LVC) technologies (including Virtual Environment (VE) technologies; (4) Past Performance and experience on Government contracts of like or similar nature; (5) Proposed teaming arrangements; (6) Whether your company intends to bid as a prime or subcontractor (discuss work that will be subcontracted and indicate prospective subcontractors that will be utilized); and (7) The size or status of your company or team based on NAICS Code 541712 and the related small business size standard of 500 employees.  This announcement does not constitute a request for proposal, but is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Contract Specialist, Metrissianne D.

<DESC>The Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) in collaboration with the US Armydesires to conduct a competition (with a cash prize for the winner) in order to foster the ability to clear training ranges of debris and unexploded ordnance using robotic technologies.  Preliminary experience to date with robotic range clearance suggests a significant potential for time and costs savings as well as increases in the safety of conducting this type activity.  The ultimate aim is to be able to clear the millions of acres currently encumbered with spent training rounds and debris to place the land back into productive use.  Thus the Department of Defense (DoD) is looking for the competition to result in viable systems that can be procured and placed into service clearing DoD ranges.
In order to effect a smooth transition from technology development to system procurement, the competition will be predicated on key decision points.  The first decision, which is whether to conduct a competition at all, is to determine the level of industry interest in participating in a competition as well as the ability to develop, then produce quantities of robotic range clearance systems.   Responses to this RFI will figure prominently in that decision. 
Assuming sufficient industry interest and capability, the competition event itself will be preceded by a qualification requirement.  Competitors looking to compete for the cash prize must first demonstrate that they can enter a viable robotic system capable of executing tasks inherent in clearing ranges.  Assuming a sufficient quantity of competitors qualify to participate in the competition, the DoD will not only award a $2M cash prize but also pursue a procurement contract to purchase robotic range clearance systems.
During technology development and integration efforts, competitors will have the opportunity to enter into no-cost arrangements with the DoD so that information may be exchanged and Government equipment can be furnished if so desired by a competitor.   Thus, two types of contracting opportunities will be available: 1) a no-cost contract instrument that enables government furnished equipment and information to support development efforts, and 2) a competitively awarded procurement contract.  It should be noted that winning the cash prize competition is no guarantee of a follow-on procurement contract award.  The two types of contracting vehicles are distinct from one another, and must be awarded based on distinctly differing criteria.
The remainder of the RFI is a more detailed discussion of the intent and construct by which the DoD intends to conduct a cash prize competition.  The final section of this document contains a list of questions, the answers to which will provide the competition sponsors with insights that will guide the final plans and decision making for how to effectively proceed with the competition.  It is understood that some questions may be difficult to answer, so respondents are asked to provide the best insights they can.

Note: Please see attachment for full Range Clearance Competition Request for Information document.

Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requiring Use of the Authority Cited:  Cardinal Health is the manufacturer of the Alaris Systems Manager package Client License and the Alaris Systems Manager Enterprise License. No one else manufactures software that is capable of interfacing wirelessly with the Alaris infusion pumps. Cardinal Health has the proprietary data to manufacture and provide ongoing software support of this software. The wireless interface allows drug library updates and CQI information to be transmitted to and from the infusion pumps.The purpose of the sole source procurement is to acquire the necessary components for the drug infusion pumps. The pumps were part of a national initiative to standardize the drug infusion pumps within the VISN. A BPA was awarded for the infusion system, but there are components that could not be acquired under the BPA. Therefore, these items must be procured open market.      			The above acquisition will be negotiated with:  Cardinal Health Solutions, Inc. 3750 Torrey View CtSan Diego, CA 92130-26356.  Solicitation of Potential Resources:   The services will be made known through the announcement on FedBizOpps, the government point of entry.

Cardinal Health Solutions remains the only manufacturer of the Alaris system. 7.

Description of market survey and any interested sources. If no market survey was conducted, state the reason:  Limited market research was conducted, and it has been determined that Cardinal Health Solutions is the only provider of the wireless software interface for the Alaris Next generation Alaris PC unit.9.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:   a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available: Response:  This software is proprietary and considered part of the infusion pump (a medical device) requiring FDA approval to market and support.  Cardinal Health is the manufacture of the infusion pumps and the wireless software they use to communicate with the server.b. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated (describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent  OR  unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements: N/Ac. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:  N/A	10.	 Action That may be Taken to Overcome Barriers to CompetitionThe action to be taken to overcome barriers to competition ranges from extremely limited to no existing action. Since Cardinal Health has the proprietary information for this drug infusion system, there appears to be no action that can be taken to thwart competitive barriers..11.  Delivery Requirements:  Provide Alaris Systems Manager Package Client License, Alaris Systems Manager Enterprise License, installation, Full SmartServiceSM, Annual Software Maintenance -Alaris Systems Manager to the Dayton VA Medical Center.12.  Acquisition Plan:  An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is   (X) is not   required for this acquisition. If the contract will be $1 million or greater, an acquisition plan is required by the FAR.13.  IT Approval:  IT Approval (X) is   (  ) is not   required for this acquisition. If it is required, include appropriate approvals. It has been conditionally approved by Mark Clutter noting partial implementation until the wireless network is upgraded. This is not required to be on the IT tracking list since it is not IT equipment.The assertions and recommendations in support of the justification and approval for the aforementioned services for a complete drug infusion system have been prepared by:___________________________________________________________________________Technical Representative (Joy Amundson, Chief Biomed)            Date                          PhoneContracting Officers Certification{This statement remains as is - The Contracting Officer has determined that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.}__________________________________________________        ___________________Contracting Officer (APRILE HORNE);  Not exceeding $500K        	Date

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Park Service (NPS), Intermountain Region (IMR), intends to award a project for preservation work on the San Miguel Chapel, Santa Fe New Mexico.  The project is being awarded in accordance with all requirements of the Challenge Cost Share program (CCSP), which is a program to increase participation by qualified partners in the preservation and improvement of NPS natural, cultural, and recreational resources in all authorized service programs and activities, both outside or inside park lands, and on national trails as defined under the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1241-51).  The NPS and partners work together on CCSP projects with mutually beneficial, shared outcomes.  The CCSP is a matching fund program. An equal amount of eligible and matching share of funds, goods, or services from non-federal sources is required. Currently, the maximum CCSP award is $30,000. Projects selected generally are able to be completed within one year.
Operating under the authority of the 1935 Historic Sites Act (16 U.S.C. 461-67) and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), the NPS administers the National Historic Landmark (NHL) Program, which provides for the identification, documentation, preservation, and interpretation of the nation's nationally significant historic buildings, sites, objects, structures, and districts.  The NPS seeks to preserve the San Miguel Chapel, a contributing building within the Barrio de Analco NHL district.  Funding for this project is being provided through the Challenge Cost Share Program (CCSP.)
The San Miguel Chapel is the central resource of the Barrio de Analco NHL, and is one of the oldest religious buildings in the United States.  Partially destroyed in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, it was rebuilt by 1710. Native American archaeological remains, Spanish Colonial woodwork and historic paintings add to the chapel's historic significance. Cornerstones Community Partnerships (CCP), a non-profit organization based in Santa Fe, New Mexico works to preserve architectural heritage and community traditions in New Mexico and the Southwest.  Youth partners in this project include students from St. Michael's High School, University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, Satin John's College, University of Texas San Antonio and local young people and city residents.  The building is owned by the Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe and the project is supported by the Catholic Archdiocese Foundation of Santa Fe who maintains the building.  The sole source justification for this award is provided here as an attachment.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering (RDEC) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division (NDC), Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a Contract on a sole source basis with MSA Inc, 3880 Meadowbrook Rd, Murrysville, PA 15668 for 141 MICH TC-2001 Combat Helmets, Tan in color with #6 padding.  These helmets will also be pre-drilled with the Three-Hole T-Bracket pattern.  The Ballistic Helmet formulated by Mine Safety Appliance (MSA) is the only ballistic helmet with a USSOCOM approved Fielding and Deployment Release.  It is the only configuration that has undergone ballistic testing by USSOCOM and has been validated and approved to meet USSOCOM performance requirements and Advanced Combat Helmet Performance Specifications. MSA is the only contractor able to produce these items and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy USSOCOM requirements.  This helmet is compatible with the legacy night vision goggles, NVG helmet mounts and accessories, O2 mask, and specific communications equipment.  The MICH TC 2001 is lightweight and comes with an approved quality assurance plan.  Additionally, it would not be feasible for the Government to test and evaluate their products for USSOCOM approval in time to meet the required delivery date.  It would take as much as 12 months and additional Government expense to conduct testing of another company's helmets and at this time USSOCOM has an immediate requirement to field the helmets listed above.  Delays to the fielding of these helmets, which would occur during full and open competition process, will increase the likelihood of a SOF operator being injured by ballistic projectile otherwise defeated by the MSA TC 2001 Helmet.  Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 2 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, NCD will proceed with awarding a firm fixed price purchase order to MSA Inc.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  Any Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Nate Jordan or by email to: Nathan.C.Jordan@us.army.mil.  This synopsis expires July 20th, 2009 at 10:00am.<BR><BR>

The existing navigation lock control system was part of the original Bonneville Second Navigation Lock construction and placed in service in 1993.  It utilizes the Sy/Max line of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)<BR>equipment manufactured by Square-D.  It consists of two processors, one for the navigation lock and one for the swing bridge, five input/output (I/O)racks enclosures, two lock control stands, and one remote monitoring station located in the powerhouse control room.  There are two lock control stands and one swing bridge control stand.  The primary lock control stand and swing bridge control stand are located at the downstream (D/S) end of the lock and the second lock control stand is located at the upstream (U/S) end of the lock.  New technologies have forced the obsolescence of many of the Sy/Max modules.  The manufacturer continues to support the product line but is focusing on helping customers to convert to their new product line.  <BR>

Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Ellaine.R.James@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR>\<BR>STATEMENT OF WORK<BR><BR>The Structural Engineering (StEB) Branch, Geosciences and Structures Division, Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory, will conduct experiments in support of the development of a new close-in PC based airblast code. This code will include the ability to predict above ground airblast and to calculate the loads on simple structural elements from a variety of explosive sources and configurations while maintaining ease of use. Emphasis will be placed on close-in airblast loads (within the fireball) and non-typical explosive sources, including HMEs (home made explosives). In order to achieve the required data to develop this code, experiments will be conducted during which air blast is measured in an extremely high pressure environment.  To measure pressures in a close-in blast environment, StEB must use sensors with sufficient high amplitude range and high frequency response. The required sensors to be used in this series of experiments have been used in past experiments in which the measurement of high pressure was required. To conduct more experiments in which high pressure recording is required and to support this particular effort, comparable sensors which are also very reliable in this extreme close-in environment are required.<BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS FOR PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0003, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, West Point Project, West Point Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the requirement to replace existing flat membrane, rock covered roof with a pitch metal roof that has a 50+ year life expectancy at the West Point Powerhouse.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR> <BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor prepared the specifications and drawings for the new roof in 2008 but actual replacement of the roof was delayed due to lack of funds.  2)  Acquisition strategy meetings held prior to ARRA funding determined existing contractor would be responsible for installing the new roof.  3)  The contractor has experience from replacing roofs at Jim Woodruff Powerhouse and George G. Andrews Powerhouse.  4) The contractor has experience with working around power generation schedules due to the operation of rotating equipment.   5)  The contractor has experience with working around the existing contractor whos performing on-site rehabilitation of generator units 2 and 3.   6) The contractor has experience in working around high voltage equipment, arc flash hazard, and suspended platforms. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen circumstance encountered during the job.<BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<p>6. AWARD INFORMATION <br />A. TYPE OF CONTRACT/INSTRUMENT: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Prospective offerors are encouraged to discuss the type of instrument proposed with the appropriate contracting point of contact prior to preparing a proposal. <br />It is anticipated that award(s) under this BAA will generally be cost plus fixed fee, completion form contracts, which require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. However, pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Air Force will consider to the greatest extent possible firm fixed price contracts. The Government reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype, or OT for Research, or similar authority, as these provide greater flexibility and reduced overhead, but may require cost sharing where feasible. The Air Force may also consider award of an appropriate technology transfer mechanism if applicable. All cost plus fixed fee contracts will require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. The ARRA imposes unique contractual requirements upon contractors receiving funding under the Act. In addition, there are unique program management and transparency requirements that might impact selection of the award instrument, as well as contractor costs. Specific FAR clauses apply and include but are not limited to FAR parts 5.7, 4.15, 25.6, and 52.204. A model contract will be provided to each apparent successful offeror for review and comment as part of the BAA solicitation and award process. <br />B. ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract to this BAA. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to this BAA. <br />D. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary. However, the Government may obtain clarifications to determine proposal acceptability. Discussions may be held with prospective awardees prior to award if needed. In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. <br />7.

PROPOSAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES <br />A. GENERAL. <br />The Government reserves the right to select for award to responsible offerors/contractors any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement are not met by the proposal due date and time. At minimum, incomplete proposals may be given lower priority and, although technically acceptable, not awarded due to funding limitations. No further evaluation criteria will be used. <br />B. EVALUATION CRITERIA. <br />The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance: <br />Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; <br />Benefit/Interest to AFRL/RDSM programs and the Maui High Performance Computing Center - DoD Supercomputing Resource Center; <br />Fund availability/affordability <br />Price will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Price will be evaluated and may be negotiated if necessary on proposals selected for award. <br /><br />C. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS <br />The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows: <br />1. CATEGORY I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals. <br />2. CATEGORY II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I. <br />3. CATEGORY III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.<br />D. AWARD NOTICES <br />Offerors will be notified in writing whether or not their proposal is recommended for award. An award recommendation is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract, is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><br />E. DEBRIEFINGS <br />When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs. <br />9. OTHER INFORMATION <br />A. SUBCONTRACTING PLANS: Small Business Subcontracting Plans are required under FAR 19.702 for efforts anticipated to exceed $550,000. Prospective offerors shall submit applicable subcontracting plans in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704 along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement. If a company has a master subcontracting plan, as described in FAR 19.701 or a comprehensive subcontracting plan, as described in DFARS 219.702, a copy of the plan shall be submitted with the proposal. The subcontracting plan is a part of the cost/business section of the proposal and will not be included in the page count. <br />B. WIDE AREA WORK FLOW NOTICE: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . <br />C. ASSOCIATE CONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS. Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required. <br />D. ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION. Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Apr 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/index.html . <br />E. Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) and forward pricing rate recommendations (FPRR's) should submit them with their proposal. <br />F. Pursuant to Far 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Pre-award Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past two years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires a vendor to work on the following project:
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Serology is a valuable tool for evaluating exposure of mammals to Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that cause Lyme borreliosis ("Lyme disease"). One of the laboratory tests that has been approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for measuring antibodies (both IgM and IgG together) to B. burgdorferi in human serum is based on a peptide antigen called "C6." This peptide reproduces the sequence of an invariable region within an immunodominant protein of B. burgdorferi called VlsE. There is published evidence that declining titers of antibodies to C6 are correlated with successful antibiotic treatment of patients with early Lyme disease. Specifically, a fourfold decrease or decrease to a negative value in anti-C6 antibody titer over a period of 6 months after treatment coincides with effective therapy in early disease. This method requires multiple assays (doubling dilutions of serum) to determine antibody titer, which is costly in time and reagents and therefore impractical for routine clinical use. A single-well test to determine the proportion of anti-C6 IgG antibodies relative to total IgG potentially could have utility in clinical practice. This contract is to develop and compare an IgG capture enzyme immunoassay with titers determined using an FDA-approved C6 commercial test kit.</p>
<p>Most patients with early Lyme disease have excellent outcomes after standard courses of antimicrobial therapy. About 10% of patients treated for early Lyme disease have subjective, non-specific symptoms months after treatment. The preponderance of evidence indicates that persistent infection after antibiotic treatment rarely occurs. Nevertheless, a serologic test in a practical format could be an aid in the clinical evaluation of individual patients who have nonspecific symptoms after antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting this procurement is 40 U.S.C. 759(g), as amended, and/or 41 U.S.C. *253-(c)(I).</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to devise and evaluate an IgG capture enzyme immunoassay that can be used as a measure of the proportion of anti-C6 IgG antibodies present in total IgG in serum samples. The evaluation should be done with samples from culture-confirmed early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease both before and 6-12 months after antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<p>CDC may benefit from this procurement by acquiring data that may support the use of serology as a predictor of the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for B. burgdorferi infection.</p>
<p>III. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to:</p>
<p>1. Acquire serum samples that were obtained from patients with culture-confirmed early Lyme disease at the time of treatment and at suitable intervals thereafter (6-12 months after antibiotic therapy). The number of serum samples should be large enough to demonstrate that decline (of 4x or to zero values) in C6 antibody titers is statistically significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with successful clinical outcome after antimicrobial therapy using the established commercial assay.</p>
<p>2. Develop and evaluate an IgG capture enzyme immunoassay for measuring antibodies to C6 peptide.</p>
<p>3. Compare the results of the IgG capture assay with the commercial assay, using serum samples acquired as per point 1 above.</p>
<p>4. Provide both the protocol and the research data to CDC in electronic form.</p>
<p>IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The vendor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Task I (months 1-2): Obtain study materials (serum samples), reagents and test kits, and engage qualified personnel for performing the scope of work. Notify project officer by email.</p>
<p>2. Task II (months 1-6): Perform the research specified in the scope of work.</p>
<p>3. Task III (month 6): Write and deliver a technical report that provides in detail all protocols and results obtained under this contract. Deliver report by e-mail as a MS word document. Deliver figures by e-mail as a PowerPoint document. Other formats acceptable by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>V. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY<br /><br />None</p>
<p>VI. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance for this procurement shall be for 6 months from the date of purchase award. Anticipated date of award is September 1, 2009.</p>
<p>VII. DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the project officer by the date required:</p>
<p>A. Notification by email that project personnel have been identified and engaged to perform the scope of work and that supplies have been purchased. Due within 1-2 months of purchase award date.</p>
<p>B. A technical report containing the IgG capture assay protocol and results comparing it to titers obtained using a commercial C6 immunoassay kit. Due on or before the end of the 6th month after purchase award date.</p>
<p>VIII. MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Previous experience performing research to design and evaluate serologic assays, as evidenced by publications in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Perference will be given to vendors with previous experience developing C6 serologic assays.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit separate technical capability statements and quotations to Linda M. Young at the e-mail address provided. Please make sure your technical statement does not contain financial information or it shall be redacted before technical review. Any potential offerers on the Excluded Parties List will be immediately disqualified. Your organization must be registered at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a> in order to do business with the Federal Government. Please submit any questions to Linda M. Young as well and they will be answered and posted on this site.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).   Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-32 are incorporated into this RFQ.    

BACKGROUND
The Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) within the National Science Foundation (NSF) requires tabulated budget authority data from various federal agencies in order to complete its annual detailed statistical tables on Federal R&D Funding by Budget Function  www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf08315.

For this action, the Vendor will update 38 tables from the current SRS budget function detailed statistical tables to show revised budget authority “actuals” for fiscal year 2008, preliminaries for FY 2009, and proposals for FY 2010 as presented in the Budget of the United States Government FY 2010 or as subsequently updated by individual federal agencies.  As options, the Vendor will also update the above tables for fiscal year 2009, preliminaries for FY 2010, and proposals for FY 2011 as presented in the Budget of the United States Government FY 2011.  The Vendor will update the same tables for fiscal year 2010, preliminaries for FY 2011, and proposals for FY 2012 as presented in the Budget of the United States Government FY 2012.  Then the Vendor will update the same tables for fiscal year 2011, preliminaries for FY 2012, and proposals for FY 2013 as presented in the Budget of the United States Government FY 2013.   Finally, the Vendor  will update the same tables for fiscal year 2012, preliminaries for FY 2013, and proposals for FY 2014  as presented in the Budget of the United States Government  FY 2014.  Note that the total number of tables may change if one or more budget functions report R&D plant funding.  For applicable years (at least FY 2009 data and possibly FY 2010 data) the Vendor will provide additional series on R&D budget authority funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

As part of this project, the Vendor will also update the OECD (“Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development”) socioeconomic objectives tables http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/append/c4/at04-41.xls .  When NSF provides some data and information in proper format for this project, including copies of data tables and the latest report prepared on federal R&D by budget function.

Detailed data will be compiled on R&D budget authority and on basic research budget authority.  Also, when R&D plant funding is included in the budget authority, the Vendor will compile detailed data on the R&D plant and R&D budget authority.  The addition of the R&D plant funding will be footnoted clearly since this effort increases data coverage prior to FY 2000.  Note that detailed data in any of the tables may change to reflect changes in agencies’ budgets by functional category.

Once the editing of the federal funding by budget function data has been completed and all known errors have been resolved in each budget function category for each agency reporting data, the Vendor will compute sub-agency totals, agency totals, and government-wide totals for each excel spreadsheet.  (Any formulas defining a cell must be converted to values.)  The Vendor will perform edit checks for consistency across all totals and subtotals.

Upon resolution of any final problems identified by NSF staff, the Vendor will prepare and deliver in hard copy and electronically final excel spreadsheets of the 38 tables in current dollars.  One set of these spreadsheets will include all algebraic formulas and data that are used to define cells and used to calculate values.  The other set of spreadsheets must be set up without algebraic formulas defining the cells, i.e. each cell must contain a value independent of any formulas or extraneous calculations or background information.  The intent is that this second set of tables can be set up with minimal effort as close to camera-ready format as possible.  Also, supplementary tables will be provided showing sub-agency totals, agency totals, and government-wide totals.  The Vendor will also provide tables comparing the data for the budget function report to the data originally submitted by agencies to OMB.  Explanatory narrative and the agency/function crosswalk table will be included.

The Vendor will maintain and provide current records of all the activities conducted under this project as documentation.  The documentation will be provided in sufficient depth for continuation of the project including listings of individuals contacted and telephone numbers and summaries of the major changes made to the original OMB Circular No. A-11 submissions of budget estimates and to previous functional allocations.


The anticipated period of performance is one year and shall include 4 one year option periods.


DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE
 
All draft deliverables for the base year, tables and text are due to NSF on or before October 15, 2009.

 All final deliverables for the base year, tables and text, are due to NSF on or before November 15, 2009.

All draft deliverables for each of the option years 1 through 4 (tables and text) are due to NSF on or before two months after release of the President’s Budget.

All final deliverables for each of the options years 1 through 4 (tables and text) are due to NSF on or before three months after release of the President’s Budget.


The National Science Foundation intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.  Firms are to provide a clear description of how all requirements in this announcement will be accomplished.

Quotes are due no later than 4:00pm, EDT, July 22, 2009.   Quotes are to be e-mailed to Jannele Gosey at jgosey@nsf.gov.     No faxes will be accepted.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 5,090 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 310 Highway 26 East, Poplarville, Mississippi.  The Government intends to exercise a (5) year renewal option at this location.   The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North-Hwy 26			East-Saw Road
South-Saw Road			West-Hwy 53

Other applicable requirements include:
	
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)

-	Parking – 40 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor’s control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.
4. Contact Information for Owner or Authorized Agent.

This is not a Solicitation for Offer, nor is this a request for proposal.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.

WRITTEN NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF SPACE MUST BE SUBMITTED BY 4: 00 PM ON July 29, 2009.

Please send written expressions of interest to:

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. Indicative is an application performance monitoring tool for measuring application performance on numerous platforms. Procurement of Follow-on Maintenance support for this would include (8 hours) 5x8 next day phone support and SUS (Software Update Service) to include: Telephone/Web assistance, remote support and software update/upgrade services. ENM currently owns this software product so upgrades must be acquired by the same Indicative Brands. If the maintenance and upgrades are not procured under the same Brand Name ENM runs the risk of violating our maintenance agreement and could incur copyright violations. An identification of the stautory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 USCODE 253 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the propsed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement. ENM currently utilizes the Indicative products and requires the maintenance support in order to provide updates and upgrades as needed. The product we own "Indicative" is the property of Nimsoft. The only entity able to provide upgrades, bug fixes, or cover any issues with the product is Nimsoft. It's important we move on this to maintain our coverage for the product. The ILMS application relies on this product to identify performance issues throughout the network.<BR><BR>

Description of the Item: Consultant Services to collect and analyze documents.


Objective:

To collect and analyze legislative, regulatory and internal CDRH documents that support two guidance documents, the creation of which will follow the CDRH Manual for the GGP Regulations such that finalized draft documents are readied for public comment, including a Notice of Availability for each guidance.

Scope of Work

A.	Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the consultant shall furnish the required personnel, material, services and facilities needed to accomplish the work described below:

B.	Identify legislative, regulatory and internal CDRH documents and content within the documents, and use this information to draft two guidance documents as follows:

C.	Guidance for Component and Replacement Laser Products:  Specifically, draft guidance on components will clarify for manufacturers what is a component and replacement laser product, and when a component product needs or doesn’t need separate certification or a product report.  The guidance will state criteria that manufacturers apply to consider a host product as a distributor of a component or subsystem.  The guidance will provide sufficient detail for manufacturers to understand 1) when they manufacturer uncertified components, certified products, or both certified and uncertified products; 2) when the products may be actually the same product differing only in its certification status; and 3) when a manufacturer who makes a component product in both uncertified (component) and certified forms, the manufacturer must complete both a product report and a registration report.  Specific questions that should be addressed by the draft guidance on component and replacement laser products, including the following sample questions:

1.  As a manufacturer of a laser product for use as a component (or replacement) part in an electronic product, what are my reporting responsibilities?

2.  As a manufacturer of a replacement part that I sell to a supplier or directly to consumers, what are my reporting responsibilities?

3.  I'm a supplier of a component that I bought from a component manufacturer.  What are my reporting responsibilities?
	
4.  What if I make a change to the component and sell it to consumers?  

5.  What if I change it and sell it as a component?

6.  I have a laser product that is a host to laser components, and the manufacturer has an accession number for those components.  Am I responsible for reporting to CDRH as a component manufacturer?  

7.  I plan to sell my laser product to consumers.  When I report my product as the manufacturer; can I just refer to the component manufacturer's accession number?

8.  What criteria should I apply to determine that my laser product is or is not a component before my customer manufactures something that integrates my laser product?  

9.  Is it my responsibility to certify my product because the manufacturer who integrates my product into theirs has no knowledge of the design, laser performance, classification, labeling or quality control and testing of my laser or laser products in general?

10. Does the promotion of a laser registered as a component violate regulations if the promotion misidentifies a laser as something other than a component?


D.	Guidance for Special Purpose Lasers – SLA and Demonstration Lasers: Specifically, draft guidance on SLA and Demonstration lasers will clarify for manufacturers under what criteria would manufacturers and CDRH identify specific purpose laser products as defined by 1040.11(b) surveying, leveling and alignment laser products and 1040.11(c) demonstration laser products.  Since each limits accessible emissions to an upper limit of Class IIIa, under what conditions would a variance (or equivalent) be required.  The draft guidance should account for the FDA’s mandate to interpret the regulations in ways that are consistent with its overall public health mission. 

1.  Can previously defined "scientific" or “general purpose” branded lasers avoid the special purpose SLA or demonstration designation simply by promoting the laser for such purposes?

2.  What would CDRH consider to be characteristics of non-SLA and non-demonstration lasers compared to characteristics of SLA and demonstration lasers?

3.  What characteristics have CDRH found to be consistent with the definitions of these laser types in 21 CFR 1040.10, including the words “manufactured designed, intended, promoted for certain purposes”? 

4.  When lasers have a plausible dual-use, which purpose will guide manufacturers in determining whether the laser product is a special purpose SLA or demonstration laser?  What if it is both a SLA and a demonstration laser?

5.	Does the promotion of a laser certified as a SLA or demonstration laser violate regulations if the promotion misidentifies a laser as something other than SLA or demonstration laser product?

E.	Analyze legislative, regulatory and internal CDRH documents to determine historical or regulatory precedents that support development and writing of guidance documents.

F.	Follow all internal CDRH procedures associated with preparing and clearing documents through the GGP Regulations and the CDRH Manual for the GGP Regulations.


Deliverables:

The contractor shall attend all meetings (in person or by phone) as requested by the Project Officer.  The contractor shall be committed to scheduled and ad hoc telephone or email interaction with Counsel, Regulations and/or Senior Office Staff.  The contractor shall complete documents by incorporating reviewer’s comments that the contractor considers to be applicable for inclusion in final drafts and shall provide those drafts to the Project Officer before the conclusion of the contract performance period.

The contractor shall:

•	Provide detailed references to documents that were instrumental in developing the guidance documents.
•	Deliver two separate and distinct guidance documents, one of which covers the topic "Guidance for manufacturers of component or replacement laser products” which provides clarification of how FDA identifies component or replacement laser products and clarifies responsibilities of manufacturers who produce these products and "Guidance for surveying, leveling and alignment or demonstration laser product manufacturers" which clarifies how FDA characterizes surveying, leveling and alignment (SLA) or Demonstration lasers so that they are readily identified by manufacturers, distributors or dealers as limited to Class IIIa.
•	Deliver the above documents in conformance with the CDRH Manual for the Good Guidance Practices (GGP) Regulations; Final Guidance for FDA Staff  for public comment, including a Notice of Availability for each.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the July 2009 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-34. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and no additional written solicitation WILL be issued.
<p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to negotiate on a sole source basis with the College of American Pathologists SNOMED Terminology Solutions (CAP STS), a not-for-profit Illinois corporation with offices in Northfield, IL for SNOMED CT&copy; consulting services relating to the completion of reimbursement mappings from SNOMED CT to ICD-9-CM. The period of performance for this purchase order is two (2) months from the award date.</p>
<p>NLM began the project to develop reimbursement mappings from SNOMED CT to ICD-9-CM in 2004. At that time NLM established a purchase order with the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the then-owners of SNOMED CT, to obtain their expertise in development of these mappings to ensure the results were definitive and credible.</p>
<p>The project was put on hold in 2006 and 2007 and was restarted in 2008. This new purchase order will facilitate the completion of this important work in fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p>CAP STS continues to be a recognized authority on the meaning and intended usage of SNOMED CT and on the current content and structure of this large and complex vocabulary. CAP STS has been involved with this project from its inception. In addition to providing expertise on SNOMED CT, CAP STS has maintained the authoritative version of the mappings over time. The resources, both time and money, needed to bring another organization up to speed so they could provide these services would be cost prohibitive and significantly delay the release of the mappings.</p>
<p>Based on all these factors, CAP STS is therefore uniquely qualified to provide the services required for this solicitation.</p>
<p>All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM. NLM Synopsis No. NLM-09-142-UHP. EMAILS AND FACSIMILES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional services required by NLM. The offeror shall include all information necessary to document and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation. All responses from responsible sources will be considered. Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 105, MSC 5488, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Contracting Officer, on (301) 496-6127. Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): htm://www.amet.gov/far/. The following clauses and provisions shall apply to this acquisition and maybe obtained from the web site: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (June 2008); FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (January 1999); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (July 2009); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items) (March 2009); and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (June 2009).</p>

<RESPDATE>073009
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>DESC: The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries in Miami, FL tends to procure for services for the investigation of responses to stress in fish. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center has been studying the prevalence of fish with externally visible abnormalities in the St. Lucie estuarine system and reference areas and has now accumulated an extensive database and results of analyses that quantify the variation in prevalence in time and space and provide insight on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors responsible for variation. In the study conducted by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the prevalence of abnormal fish is being developed as a performance measure to help evaluate the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration efforts in South Florida. Biological indices of habitat quality, rather than chemical indices, are needed to assess the effectiveness of hydrologic restoration and water quality improvement efforts taking place in south Florida and elsewhere. It is impractical to conduct chemical tests for all the contaminants that might be present and there are major gaps in knowledge about the biological relevance of concentration data. This procurement is for a specific set of tasks that includes exploratory histopathology of existing, previously frozen samples that have already been examined with radiological techniques, quantitative histopathology of selected internal and external structures in wild-caught fish from the St. Lucie system, a pilot project to apply to fish a practical, inexpensive quantitative method of evaluating immune-competency. Potential offerors shall be able to perform the following: Task 1. Conduct intensive histopathology of a subset of frozen fish carcasses from the group of fish previously examined radiologically for skeletal and fin anomalies, integrating results with results of the radiological study. Examine these fish for granulomas and other obvious pathology that might remain preserved even though the specimens have been frozen. Conduct histopathology on samples from anomalous morphological features and muscle samples from these fish.<br />Task 2. Examine gill tissue and skin samples exhibiting color patches from freshly-caught fish from the St. Lucie system (N=20) and a reference site (N=20). Histologically observe and analyze gill tissue for general exposure-related responses (e.g., hyperplasia and hypertrophy) to possible stressors. Histologically observe skin tissues from sites of grossly observable color patches.<br />Task 3. Examine liver samples from the same specimens (in Task 2 above) for general immune system markers such as macrophage aggregates. Perform quantitative analysis of macrophage aggregates. Make other observations from these samples, including intracellular vacuolization.<br />Task 4. Test and refine the use of a practical quantitative method of measuring immuno-competency in fish in a laboratory setting for possible application to wild-caught fish.<br />Task 5. Prepare summary report. Contractor must be a qualified histopathologist with a laboratory facility equipped to provide this service. The government prefers the contractor to be centrally located but is not mandatory. This is a small business setaside. NAICS code is 541690. Business size standard is $7.0M. Any business capable of providing this service is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures. The solicitation can be uploaded from this website. Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation on or about July 22, 2009. Potential vendors are encouraged to return to this site to obtain the Request for Quotation. Faxed requests can be sent to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker. The government requires that all contractors doing business with the government must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

In addition, the plans may address any of the resource concerns in the Pennsylvania Technical Guide on all operations with emphasis on crop and livestock operations needing technical assistance that results in a change of operation.  

Conservation Plans that document the current operation on the farm are not the focus of this program.  

Once a contract is obtained with NRCS, respondents will be assigned to producers and will be issued a Task Order.  Those respondents who are successful in receiving a contract for conservation planning may recommend farmer clients who may need conservation planning technical assistance and upon agreement by NRCS a Task Order may follow for that recommended farmer.  

NRCS will, to the extent possible, assign farmers with producers with whom there is already a working relationship. 

The contracts issued will be based upon a Best Value Determination whereas price and other factors are approximately equal.  [See FAR 52.212-2]

CONTRACT TYPE -- One or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts may be awarded from this solicitation.  An IDIQ contract is one in which an unknown quantity will be ordered during the contract period.  There are no guarantees of any orders other than the minimum amount.

CONTRACT PERIOD -- Five years from date of award.

LOCATION -- This is a statewide initiative.  Respondents should indicate their availability statewide, or by quarter of the state described as NW, NE, SW, and SE.  

MINMUM REQUIREMENTS -- NRCS Conservation Planning Certification or the equivalent to be determined by NRCS.  

BEST VALUE FACTORS:

Quantity of Work -Each respondent should indicate the quantity of work they can accomplish.  This can be indicated by statements such as, “Work can be accomplished with 1-20 producers at any given time.”  Work can be accomplished with 20-40 producers at any given time..etc.”

Prices -  The cumulative total of CLINs one, two, three, and four will be used at the offered price. 

STANDARDS -- All work to be done shall be in accordance with the NRCS Conservation Planning Handbook. 

The conservation Planning format shall be according to those compatible with Conservation Toolkit, although it is not expected that Conservation Toolkit software will be used until after it is available to the private sector.  The Conservation Plug-In will be used once it is released in a useable format so that customer information can be obtained from the national; Conservation Planning Database.  Plug-In will also be used once available to input completed planning data.  Conservation Plans will be written with consideration of rolling into an EQIP or other contract for financial assistance to help implement the practices in the conservation plan if the farmer applicant has a successful ranking for the program.  Possession of a current conservation plan may result in a higher ranking in some programs but does not ensure a financial assistance contract.  

DELIVERABLES -- Three (3) copies of every conservation plan shall be provided, one for the NRCS State Office to be accompanied by a proper invoice for payment, one for the USDA Service Center NRCS Field Office, and one for the farmer.   

MISCELLANEOUS -- All contractors must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration and Online Representations and Certifications websites in accordance with Federal law. 

Central Contractor Registration (CCR)
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (subpart 4.11) requires that contractors be registered in the CCR database prior to being awarded a contract. Detailed information about CCR is available on the World Wide Web at www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at 1-888-227-2423.
Registration in CCR
 	The preferred method for registration is via the World Wide Web at www.ccr.gov. A CCR handbook, a copy of the registration template, and on-line information about the registration process and information required are available at that site. 
 	Vendors may register by submitting the registration template to the Department of Defense, Central Contractor Registration 74 Washington Ave., N., Suite 7, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084. 
Registration Process
 	The first step is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B). 
 	To request a DUNS number call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register online at ccr.dnb.com/ccr/pages/CCRSearch.jsp. 
 	Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge. 
 	When you obtain a DUNS number you might be included on D&B's marketing list that is sold to other companies. If you do not want to be included on this list, ask D&B to remove your company's name from the marketing list. 
 	Once you have a DUNS number you can begin the CCR registration process. 
 	If registering on-line go to www.ccr.gov - select "Start New Registration." You will need your DUNS number to start this registration. 
 	If registering using the paper copy of the registration template, complete the form, including your DUNS number, and mail to the address indicated above. 
Access to the CCR Database — Caution regarding TPIN number
 	The CCR is designed to be a highly secure, single repository of vendor information.  Vendors are required to enter financial information into CCR for the purpose of facilitating payments through electronic funds transfer. Only authorized Government representatives or the vendors themselves can access this financial information.  Once registration is complete, each vendor receives a Trading Partner identification Number (TPIN) that is his/her secure/confidential password. The TPIN should NOT be used on contracts or other Government paperwork. The TPIN is the vendor's confidential password to allow the vendor to access his/her data in the CCR database. Vendors need both their DUNS number and TPIN number to access their data. At a minimum, vendors will need to access their data annually. Vendors must renew/update their data annually to keep their CCR registration active. 
Please note that registration in CCR does not guarantee business with the Federal Government.
On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)
What is ORCA?
 	ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR representations and certifications required by solicitations.  With ORCA, vendors have the ability to maintain their representation and certification information via the World Wide Web at orca.bpn.gov.  Representations and certifications completed in ORCA will not need to be submitted with each offer (proposal or bid). Solicitations will include a provision that allows vendors to certify that their representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate, or to list any exceptions/changes to those certifications.
Vendor Registration in ORCA
 	To register in ORCA, you need to have an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record, a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) from your CCR record, and know your DUNS number.  Detailed information regarding ORCA and how to submit records is available on the ORCA Web site at orca.bpn.gov under Help and FAQs.

NOTE:(1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard.(2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee's clearance status may suffice depending on the employee's status within the JPAS database.(3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material.(4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.
VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER.Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person's citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).
Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).Service contractor: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract.
IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENDOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.
If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. 

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer. 
(c) Evaluation of offers. 
(1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American Act, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9.

(d) Alternate offers. 
(1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material.

An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested— 
(i) Will be rejected as non-responsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or 
(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT<br />BAA-09-RD-06<br />Air Force Research Laboratory/Directed Energy Directorate <br />ANNOUNCEMENT OVERVIEW <br />BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: HPCM Maui Energy Improvement Initiative (MEII)<br />BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-09-RD-06<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE PROPOSAL RESPONSE DATE AND TIME HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO 31 AUGUST 2009 - 12:00PM MOUNTAIN TIME</strong></p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: The HPCM Maui Energy Improvement Initiative (MEII) "will make solar power more efficient, affordable, and applicable to military installations". This project provides the key demonstration steps to bring improvement to the Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC) - DoD Supercomputing Resource Center as a showcase for an energy independent future. ...this effort ... will leave in place a significant power generation capability." The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is soliciting proposals for an Advanced High Efficiency Photovoltaic System prototype and demonstration for the MEII. <br />This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) describing the research areas of interest/benefit for the RDSMA program. One award is anticipated with a period of performance of 15 months. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to this BAA. <br />PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: Proposals for all areas will be due by 12:00 p.m., Mountain Daylight Savings Time (MDST) 45 days after publication of the FedBizOpps notification. Proposals received after this due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c) (3). <br />ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Anticipated funding for the program (not per contract or award): FY 09 $3.888M (All Recovery Act Funding). This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice. <br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The applicable NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is unrestricted. This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps/EPS http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended. <br />TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. It is anticipated that awards under this BAA will generally be cost plus fixed fee, completion form contracts, which require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act imposes unique contractual requirements upon contractors receiving funding under the Act. In addition, there are unique program management and transparency requirements that might impact selection of the award instrument, as well as contractor costs.

<p>6. AWARD INFORMATION <br />A. TYPE OF CONTRACT/INSTRUMENT: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Prospective offerors are encouraged to discuss the type of instrument proposed with the appropriate contracting point of contact prior to preparing a proposal. <br />It is anticipated that award(s) under this BAA will generally be cost plus fixed fee, completion form contracts, which require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. However, pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Air Force will consider to the greatest extent possible firm fixed price contracts. The Government reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype, or OT for Research, or similar authority, as these provide greater flexibility and reduced overhead, but may require cost sharing where feasible. The Air Force may also consider award of an appropriate technology transfer mechanism if applicable. All cost plus fixed fee contracts will require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. The ARRA imposes unique contractual requirements upon contractors receiving funding under the Act. In addition, there are unique program management and transparency requirements that might impact selection of the award instrument, as well as contractor costs. Specific FAR clauses apply and include but are not limited to FAR parts 5.7, 4.15, 25.6, and 52.204. A model contract will be provided to each apparent successful offeror for review and comment as part of the BAA solicitation and award process. <br />B. ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract to this BAA. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to this BAA. <br />D. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary. However, the Government may obtain clarifications to determine proposal acceptability. Discussions may be held with prospective awardees prior to award if needed. In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. <br />7.

Cost/Business Proposal <br />Separate this proposal into a cost section and a business section. <br />a. Cost Section. The cost proposal containing other than cost or pricing data shall be submitted in the format provided in the announcement and is necessary for the Government to perform a cost realism analysis. Adequate price competition is anticipated for this BAA, unless stated otherwise in the announcement. A determination as to the existence of adequate price competition will be made by the cognizant Procuring Contracting Officer on a case by case basis. If adequate price competition is determined not to exist, the Government reserves the right to obtain certified cost or pricing data from the offeror. Based on the type of instrument proposed, use the appropriate cost proposal instructions, which can be found at the following AFRL website, www.kirtland.af.mil/prs to prepare the cost proposal. Submit the electronic copy of the cost proposal worksheets on a compact disk in a PC compatible file format in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 or later version. The file must contain all cell formulas. Cost proposals have no page limitations but offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 75 pages as a goal. <br />b. Business Section. The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual arrangement, such as type of contract/instrument, any unique terms and conditions, any exceptions to terms and conditions of this announcement, and any information not technically related. Provide rationale for exceptions. As a goal, offerors are requested to keep the business section to 20 pages. This section should include the following items as appropriate. Referenced documents are available at http://www.kirtland.af.mil/prs/. <br />(1) Completed representations and certifications and any specific representations and certifications identified in this BAA. <br />(2) Completed Proposal Content Checklist.

PROPOSAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES <br />A. GENERAL. <br />The Government reserves the right to select for award to responsible offerors/contractors any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement are not met by the proposal due date and time. At minimum, incomplete proposals may be given lower priority and, although technically acceptable, not awarded due to funding limitations. No further evaluation criteria will be used. <br />B. EVALUATION CRITERIA. <br />The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance: <br />Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; <br />Benefit/Interest to AFRL/RDSM programs and the Maui High Performance Computing Center - DoD Supercomputing Resource Center; <br />Fund availability/affordability <br />Price will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Price will be evaluated and may be negotiated if necessary on proposals selected for award. <br /><br />C. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS <br />The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows: <br />1. CATEGORY I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals. <br />2. CATEGORY II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I. <br />3. CATEGORY III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.<br />D. AWARD NOTICES <br />Offerors will be notified in writing whether or not their proposal is recommended for award. An award recommendation is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract, is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><br />E. DEBRIEFINGS <br />When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs. <br />9. OTHER INFORMATION <br />A. SUBCONTRACTING PLANS: Small Business Subcontracting Plans are required under FAR 19.702 for efforts anticipated to exceed $550,000. Prospective offerors shall submit applicable subcontracting plans in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704 along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement. If a company has a master subcontracting plan, as described in FAR 19.701 or a comprehensive subcontracting plan, as described in DFARS 219.702, a copy of the plan shall be submitted with the proposal. The subcontracting plan is a part of the cost/business section of the proposal and will not be included in the page count. <br />B. WIDE AREA WORK FLOW NOTICE: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . <br />C. ASSOCIATE CONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS. Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required. <br />D. ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION. Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Apr 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/index.html . <br />E. Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) and forward pricing rate recommendations (FPRR's) should submit them with their proposal. <br />F. Pursuant to Far 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Pre-award Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past two years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>

housing unit by the rack or wall mounted integrated HEPA filtering Bio-PAK
delivering "clean" air to the stainless steel delivery manifold system under positive
pressure terminating in individual cage air injector tubes. The "clean" air is then
delivered to each cage by means of a stainless steel cage mounted "bullet" air diffuser.
Exhaust air from each cage is captured by a unique Patented "U" shaped negative
pressure stainless steel channel manifold encapsulating three sides of the Micro-
Barrier filter cover flange area, collected into a return air stainless steel manifold
system and finally forced through a HEPA filtered rack mounted integrated Exhaust
Pak blower system and exhausted into the room atmosphere. All four (4) inch supply
and return plenums utilize sealed access doors and drains for simplified cleaning
and drainage after sanitization. Both vertical supply and exhaust plenums will be
located on the same end of the rack.
Rack assembly consists of one hundred and forty (140) 18 gauge individual stainless
steel split platform supports mechanically locked to ¾ " x ½ “ rectangular 16 gauge
internal tubular uprights. The split platform design decreases rack overall weight
and enhances visibility within the cage. Each internal upright is heliarc welded to
the external rack frame that will be constructed of a 14 gauge 1" x 1" tubular base,
uprights and upper frame structure to insure strength.
The entire assembly shall be plate mounted on stainless steel Jarvis and Jarvis
casters, two with brakes and 5" diameter phenolic wheels.

Mechanical Operation
The Edstrom A-160 shielded valve with the "Coupling Design" Air/ Water Cup
Assembly shall be integrated into the Micro-BARRIER Cage System and travel with
the cage assembly once removed from the rack. The "Coupling Design" automated
water valve assembly shall be operated by an automatic, spring loaded lock
mechanism located to the lower right of each individual Micro-BARRIER Cage
System. Proper docking to the air and water grommets shall be achieved by placing
the Micro-BARRIER
Housing System within the channel or cage guide. This operation will automatically
open the lock/indicator mechanism (continually allowing both hands to secure the
cage assembly) permitting the BARRIER Housing assembly to slide towards the
air/water connection systems.
Proper docking shall be achieved by gently sliding the BARRIER assembly to the
rear of the cage guide channel. Activation (air and/or watering) shall take place
immediately when the cage assembly stops its front to rear travel. Once in position,
positive locking shall be achieved automatically when the swing lock mechanism
engages in the front of the cage holding it secure to the air/water manifolds.
Disengagement of the Barrier System from the Micro-VENT Unit is achieved by
placing both hands on the cage body (with the back of the hand opening the lock
mechanism, clearing the cage body) and gently pulling the assembly forward.
Visual Indicator
A visual positive lock indicator will determine proper activation of the air/water
assembly. This positive lock indicator shall be comprised of a RED cage indicator tab
located on the swing lock mechanism. The indicator will protrude (to the right)
approximately 1/2 " from a stainless steel housing mechanism when the cage is not
within the specified locking position of the air/water connection device. In order to
achieve and assure proper connection of the Micro-BARRIER Housing System to the
air/water connection device, the RED indicator tab must be completely encased within
the stainless steel housing. Absence of any RED markings from the barrel of the
indicator tab shall indicate that the proper connection has been achieved. Location of
the indicator shall be directly above the lock arm on the right front side of each Micro-
BARRIER Housing System.
Note: All watering components are to be manufactured by Edstrom Industries.
These components shall include; water manifolds, male and female cage
connections systems, water valve and cage lock assembly.
Supply Blower
Smart Bio-Pak module is a HEPA filtered air supply unit designed specifically for the
Allentown Caging Micro-FLO and Micro-VENT Environmental Systems. The
lightweight 20 lb. module is constructed of an aluminum cabinet with an electro static
powder coated textured white surface. Each Smart Bio-Pak shall be complete with
prefilter (Aluminum framed Scott foam media, 45 PPI, washable and flame retardant),
forward impeller fan, HEPA filter (99.99% efficient @ .3 microns Emery 3004
tested) and a 10 ft power cord. The HEPA module shall also feature a universal power
supply with a 24 VDC motor blower that assures consistent performance under
various electrical conditions (85-264 VAC., 50/60 Hz.). A microprocessor control
board automatically adjusts the blower speed, utilizing "feed-back" control technology
to maintain constant air flow as the HEPA filter begins to load.
Each unit will also be equipped with various lighted indicators (located on each front
panel) and an LCD Panel Display. The front panel will house an on-off switch, a
single green light for normal operations and a series of two (2) red indicator
lights that will illuminate if a malfunction occurs. The red warning lights will
illuminate if problems are sensed with the filter or blower. In addition, an LCD screen
(located below the indicator panel) shall identify cage ACH (air Changes per Hour).
In addition there is a maintenance mode which can be accessed by a certifier or ACE
technician to display rack CFM (cubic feet per minute), inlet air temperature, motor
speed in RPM and ACH.
The Smart Bio-Pak shall also feature an external alarm connection for remote
monitoring. Relay, resistive, analog, and digital monitoring configurations available.
Complete connection details and operating requirements are available upon request.
Exhaust Blower
Lightweight, all aluminum cabinet with an electro static powder coated textured white
surface for low, 20 lb weight. The unit comes complete with pre-filter (Scott foam
media, 45 PPI, washable & flame retardant), HEPA filter (99.99% 0.3 micron),
efficient Emery 3004 tested & probed to ensure Class 100 air quality, magnehelic air
pressure gauge and the single inlet forward curved impeller blower. When the
Exhaust-Pak is used with the Bio-Pak unit, they are interconnected assuring that
positive

<DESC><p>Amendment 3:
<p>FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY: NGA IS NOW BLOCKING ALL EMAILS THAT CONTAIN A URL OR WEB ADDRESS</p>
<p>Question 19: RFP - RFP 52.212-2 EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />Relative Order of Importance, Area 1 - Technical/Management, Factor T1 Quality of Personnel, Standard 2. Personnel</p>
<p>Standard 2 says: The standard is met when the proposed personnel have the skills as demonstrated by portfolio submission, experience and qualifications as demonstrated by resume submission appropriate for the four work roles established in the SOW.</p>
<p>There are not four work roles established in the SOW. Are the "four work roles" the same as the four areas for which services are provided - printing, photography, graphics and video support?</p>
<p>Answer 19: Yes, the four work roles are printing, graphics, photography and video support.</p>
<p>Question 20: SF 1449 and Q&amp;As posted July 1, 2009. SF 1449 says due date is July 28, 2009; Q&amp;A says due date is July 24, 2009. Will you be amending the SF1449 to reflect the new proposal due date?</p>
<p>Answer 20: Proposals are due 24 July 2009, 12:00 EST. The SF 1449 has been attached to reflect due date.</p>
<p>Question 21: SF 1449 and Continuation Sheet - Instructions to Offerors</p>
<p>SF 1449 lists a different Contracting Officer (Aundra M. Rhone Jones) and Deliver to address (Bethesda, MD) than the Instructions (Ericka Franklin, Chantilly, VA).</p>
<p>Do the Instructions override the SF 1449? Will the SF 1449 be amended in this regard?</p>
<p>Answer 21: In this instance the delivery instructions override the SF 1449 and in accordance with the proposal submission instructions, page 9.</p>
<p>Question 22: RFP: Page 15, Small Business Participation Plan - re: SF 295. Can the SF 295 be submitted as an attachment or must it be included in the Technical/Management Volume and count against the total page count?</p>
<p>Answer 22: The Small Business Participation Plan may be submitted separately.</p>
<p>Question 23: Q&amp;A responses posted July 9, 2009. Submission of artists' portfolios</p>
<p>How many copies of artists' digital portfolios are needed? Do you want these CDs/DVDs submitted with the rest of the proposal? If so, should they labeled as part of Volume II or packaged another way?</p>
<p>Answer 23: One (1) copy of the portfolios</p>
<p>Question 24: The SF1449 is in .pdf form. How should the contractors submit the completed forms to the customer? Are we required to re-create the SF1449 form and send, or print, fill out, and scan and deliver the .pdf version?</p>
<p>Answer 24: You may print, fill out, and scan and deliver the .pdf version.&nbsp; Attached is an amended&nbsp; SF1449.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 25: Solicitation Attachments. Attachment 7. Are these agreements to be signed by employees in conjunction with proposal submittal, or after award?</p>
<p>Answer 25: Attachment 7, Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be signed after contract award.</p>
<p>Question 26: With respect to the Government's answer to Question #14, are we to assume then that all staff being bid on this contract is bid as Key Personnel since the Government has stated they will apply the Key Personnel Clause to all staff assigned to the contract? If not, then what are the differentiators between Key Personnel and other personnel if the KP clause and 12-month require is applied to all staff being bid?"</p>
<p>Answer 26: All personnel need to be in place for year one. Key personnel would be determined and identified by the contractor in order to facilitate management and execution of the SOW requirements.</p>
<p>Question 27: RFP: Cost Volume: Per page 12, (d) Proposal Format, (4) Binding: Can the cost volume be submitted in a separate binder? (for a total of 3 binders)</p>
<p>Answer 27: The cost volume may be submitted in a separate binder.</p>
<p>Question 28: Several companies are participants in the DoD Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan Test Program, request that FAR 52.219-9 and DFAR 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts) (APR 2007) be replaced with (or amended to include) DFAR 252.219-7004, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program) (APR 2007).</p>
<p>Answer 28: The clause may be included as prescribed by DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(B). However, you are required to address how small businesses are to be used on the proposed requirement such as the small business participation.</p>
<p>Question 29: Quality assurance surveillance plan<br />11.1 Offerors shall submit a proposed quality assurance surveillance plan for the Government's consideration in development of the Government's plan. Does this plan need to be provided with the proposal or upon award?</p>
<p>Answer 29: The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan shall be provided with the proposal.</p>
<p>Question 30: Is this considered a new requirement?</p>
<p>Answer 30: This is considered a new requirement. The visual communication tasks are currently being performed under two separate contracts. The video and graphic design services are currently performed by Chugach under the BOS-C contract and the printing press, graphics and photography services are performed by Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>Question 31: In reference to the subject RFP: There is guidance that recommends delivering graphic's portfolios in jpeg file format. Could you provide clarity on how we may electronically package those images? For example, many graphics portfolios are presented on CD-ROM in .pdf form.</p>
<p>Answer 31: All portfolios must be able to be read/played on a standard computer or commercial DVD player. No special software or hardware must be needed to play or view portfolios. As long as the files can be opened on above mentioned equipment then format does play an issue regarding portfolio submission.</p>
<p>Question 32: As a participant in the DoD Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan Test Program, we request that FAR 52.219-9 and DFAR 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts) (APR 2007) be replaced with (or Amended to include) DFAR 252.219-7004, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program)(APR 2007).</p>
<p>Answer 32:&nbsp;In accordance with 219.708 (B) and (2) and (c)(1) as described in 219.702, if a contractor is part of the "Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program)", any contract awarded to them will have the following adjustments to any awarded contract:</p>
<p>1. Use the clause 252.219-7004, Small Business Subcontracting Plan(Test Program), instead of the clauses at 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts) and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.</p>
<p>2. Delete the clause FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages - Subcontracting Plan.</p>
<p>3. Delete the clause FAR 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:

<DESC>July 15, 2009 -- The following are additional questions asked and the answers:

Question 1:  The request states vendor need supply ratings for holding companies and their respective “subsidiaries.” Elsewhere in the request you specify a requirement for ratings for the parent and the bank/thrift subsidiaries. Please confirm that the request does NOT require ratings for the significant non-bank operating subs of the parent holding company such as broker dealers, insurers, etc.

Answer 1:  Confirmed.

Question 2a:  The requests states that the SEC requires “a commercially available service that, at a minimum, analyses all publicly available data reported for all holding companies that are SEC registrants and their respective subsidiaries, as reported to their primary regulator.”

     a.  Does this requirement mean that a compliant proposal must include ratings based upon a comprehensive survey of data from SEC, FDIC and the Fed? For example, must a rating for a bank holding company (BHC) rely upon data gathered by the Fed in the Form Y-9 or may the vendor employ SEC filings data in reaching its ratings for a BHC?

Answer 2a:  The Contractor should utilize primary bank regulator data and not SEC data.

Question 2b:  The requests states that the SEC requires “a commercially available service that, at a minimum, analyses all publicly available data reported for all holding companies that are SEC registrants and their respective subsidiaries, as reported to their primary regulator.”

     The OTS does not collect or publicly disclose data for thrift holding companies. Also, many thrift holding companies have significant non-financial operations. Will a proposal with ratings for the thrift subsidiary based upon FDIC bank unit data and/or a holding company rating based upon SEC data be compliant?

Answer 2b:  Thrift subsidiary data should be from primary regulator (FDIC or OTS).  Thrift holding company data should be provided by primary regulator, if available.  If not, SEC data should be used.

Question 3:  The request specifies “a qualitative rating of the items below, using CAMELS rating format.”  Will a ratings methodology in an extant COTS product that includes all of the factors listed in the request but in a different order or presentation format and/or with different labels be compliant?

Answer 3:  This question is interpreted as, "Is a COTS product that includes all of the factors listed in the request but in a different order or presentation format and/or with different labels compliant?  The SEC would like the labels to be as close as possible, but the order is not important.

Question 4a:  Bank supervisors and stock market investors engage in extensive monitoring of BHCs, but for different reasons. Investors are looking to ensure that BHC managers maximize shareholder value, but bank supervisors monitor BHCs to enforce regulations, gauge their safety and soundness, and guard against broader systemic risk. A “CAMELS” type analysis listed in the request is specifically designed for assessing bank safety and soundness. The analysis that is applicable to holding companies is far broader, however, and focuses instead on the ability of the parent holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks.

     Please confirm that the intent of the request is to provide an equivalent of a “CAMELS” type analysis applied to the parent holding company only and NOT to include the other factors contained in an “RFI” BHC rating maintained by the Fed as part of its supervisory process.

Answer 4a:  Confirmed.

Question 4b:  Please confirm, in general terms, the analytical objectives of the request. Is the SEC interested only in a safety and soundness type analysis a la the “CAMELS” type rating or does the SEC wish to receive a broader analysis that focuses on other factors, for example, such as those included in the Basel II framework such as Economic Capital?

Answer 4b:  Confirmed.

Question 5:  Regarding supplementary risk and stress measures, bank risk analysis involves evaluating data using methodologies in addition to the core “CAMELS” test points. These additional examination warning flags are part of supplementary test used by bank regulators to determine conditions of risk, financial factors and extraordinary stress caused by the parent company and/or non-depository subsidiaries on the subsidiary depository institution(s).  To what degree does the SEC value the incorporation of these types of analysis elements as part of the services contract?

Answer 5:  The SEC is interested in "warning flags" to assess risk(s).

Question 6:  Regarding question 4(b) above and more generally, IRA employs analytical anomaly flags and automated test battery analysis systems to provide a tripwire line of defense for users of our ratings. Certain combinations of test outcome patterns indicate conditions that recommend additional examination by the ratings consumer to confirm or deny the existence of risk.  To what degree does the SEC desire the contractor to incorporate tripwire indicators which are part of the COTS product into the service offering? Is the SEC open to considering some of the contemporary methods for risk analysis or is the “CAMELS” style analysis, which is decades old, sufficient?

Answer 6:  The SEC would be open to additional tripwire indicators, but we would not be willing to undertake additional analysis to interpret data on our own.

Question 7a:  The request specifies “a spreadsheet format that can be manipulated by the user.” A single spreadsheet containing the requested data may be cumbersome and difficult to manipulate.  Is the SEC open to other forms of delivery such as individual spreadsheets for each institution or a web services facility that can deliver such spreadsheets upon request?

Answer 7a:  The SEC would be open to a general spreadsheet with Camel-type rating numbers and more comprehensive data provided by individual spreadsheets or on-line.

Question 7b:  Is the SEC interested in other types of functionality related to the display and/or delivery of the required ratings and data? For example, if vendor has extant capability in a COTS product to display the relationships required and deliver the ratings, and supporting data elements and derived metrics, in an Excel spreadsheet and/or SQL table upon request, would such a delivery arrangement be compliant with the request?

Answer 7b:  An existing commercial product which incorporates the ratings we require is acceptable and compliant.

Question 8a:  Regarding coverage, banking reporting entities do not have a perfect one-to-one correspondence to SEC Registrants. Most records resolve so that banking ID’s can be correlated to market symbols and SEC CIK numbers. Some require additional manual investigation.  To what extent does the SEC wish the contractor incorporate an ongoing level of effort to resolve disconnects between the two reporting regimes as part of the contract? Is this assumed to be part of the COTS product offering?

Answer 8a:  If a Contractor anticipates disconnects that might occur between the two reporting regimes, they should include this information in their response.  The SEC needs clarification on the types of disconnects, if applicable, that a contractor anticipates.

Question 8b:  The request refers to “SEC registrants.” Does this include voluntary filers?

Answer 8b:  Yes.
=======================

The following are questions asked and the answers:

Question 1:  This is exaclty similar to Solicitation # SECHQ1-09-Q-0128.  Was that solicitation canceled?
Answer 1:  SECHQ1-09-Q-0128 was canceled and a notice was posted on FBO.  This requirement is different because it includes savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiary thrift instititions.  It also specifies ALL holding companies that are SEC registrants.

Question 2:  Does my firm need to have a GSA Schedule in order to submit a quote?
Answer 2:  No, you do not need to have a GSA Schedule to respond to the request for quote.  All vendors are encouraged to submit a response.

Question 3:  Is it possible to submit our quote without the CCR or ORCA?
Answer 3:  Quoters must be able to show that they have made an attempt to register with CCR and provide their certifications in ORCA.  You can submit an email, a copy/screen shot of the CCR and/or ORCA page to show your attempt to comply with the requirements of the contract.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. 

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 ATF3-6 ENGINE NOSE-COWLING (PN 553-0170 SERIES) REPAIR
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel (Falcon Jet Corporation).  Each aircraft is equipped with two Honeywell ATF3-6 fan jet engines.  Typical failure modes of ATF3-6 engine nose-cowlings (intake) are material cracks that propagate as a result of various environmental factors.  Some of these include: vibration, corrosion, thermal fatigue and erosion.  These failures occur primarily at the nose lip rivet lines.  Past history shows that a complete or partial disassembly of the nose-cowling is necessary for thorough inspection and repair or replacement of damaged components.  During the last repair cycle Nose-Lip Assembly P/Ns 553-0169-1 or M20H5530169-1 were replaced with a 321 stainless steel assembly which has proven to meet the aircraft’s operational characteristics.   
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 ATF3-6 nose-cowling assemblies.  Repaired nose-cowlings must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM’s) form, fit and function specifications to ensure installation and operational characteristics are met. During the last repair cycle the Coast Guard started replacing the original aluminum nose lip (PNs 553-0169-1 or M20H5530169-1) with a nose lip manufactured from 321 stainless steel,: however, there may be some nose cowlings remaining in the Coast Guard supply system with the aluminum nose lip still installed.  The contractor shall replace the remaining nose lip assemblies with stainless steel and assign a new part number if applicable.  In addition, corrosion preventative measures shall be incorporated during the repair.
	Note:  Nose cowlings have several different parts numbers assigned and listed in the Coast Guard supply records.  Each part number is similar in design and function.  
The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair nose-cowlings.
The Coast Guard anticipates different levels of repairs: 
The offeror’s responsibilities to the Coast Guard consist of preparing and submitting a detailed work specification and cost breakdown structure for repair and ensure that all Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) remain incorporated upon completion of work. Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.
The Coast Guard Aircraft Logistic Center Center’s (ALC) Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) Product Line and the selected offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance plan and service level agreements.
2.2	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria as part of their proposal package:
2.2.1	Technical
2.2.1.1	Provide detailed work specifications for nose-cowling repair.
2.2.1.2	Provide a written Performance plan that includes the repair turn around time
2.2.1.3	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
2.2.1.4	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s form, fit and function characteristics.
2.2.1.5	Exterior paint scheme for the engine nose-cowling consists of an epoxy primer which meets MIL-PRF-23377 and top coated with Sherwin Williams Jet GLO Express product number Y05412, Federal Standard 595 color 17860 or equal. 
2.2.1.6	Temporary repairs are not permissible repairs for the purpose of this contract (e.g., stop drilling of cracks and external doublers).
2.2.1.7	Provide separate cost breakdowns for contractor proposed levels of repair (labor and parts inc the nose lip).
2.2.1.8	The contractor shall provide documentation describing material, weight and heat transfer properties of the nose lip, and assign a new part number.
2.2.2	Past Performance
2.2.2.1	Provide documentation for having performed repair of similar or like items.
2.2.2.2	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.
2.2.3	Certifications
2.2.3.1	Be certified by the FAA and have experience in repairing/overhaul of similar or like nose cowlings.  If the contractor for any reason looses its FAA certification during the period of performance; this constitutes a material breach of contract and may result in contract termination.  The contractor shall notify the Coast Guard’s Contracting Officer verbally and in writing no later then five (5) calendar days after certification forfeiture disclosing the events that caused such.
2.2.3.2	Provide copies of all certifications (e.g. FAA, OEM, ISO 9000, etc.)

FAR 52.212-1  Instructions To Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008) ADDENDUM
SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.702(a)(1), the offeror shall submit a subcontracting plan along with any proposal which exceeds $500,000 and which has subcontracting possibilities. 
If the proposal exceed $500,000 and the offeror believes there are no subcontracting possibilities, the offeror should include with the proposal a letter so stating, along with supporting rationale. The plan shall comply with the requirements of FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. In accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause, upon acceptance by the Contracting Officer, the plan will be incorporated into the resultant contract. NOTE: SUBCONTRACTING PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED FROM A SMALL BUSINESS OR FOREIGHN FIRMS.
FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

&#61607;	The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

o	Factor 1 –Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price
Factors 1, 2 and 3 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 4.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.  Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical, past performance and performance factors approach equality.

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach
The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Offeror’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Nose Cowling (repair).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the offeror has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:
(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.
(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.
(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

&#61607;	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.

&#61607;	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.

&#61607;	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.


(d)	The Offeror’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.
Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics
The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:
(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,

(b)	Identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,

(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance
The past performance evaluation will examine how the Offeror’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.
The past performance evaluation will also examine the Offeror’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.
Factor 4:  Cost/Price
Each Offeror’s cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:
(a)	Evaluation or proposed price/cost.  Offeror’s quote shall include a firm-fixed-price for each of the one-year ordering periods contained in the 3-year base & the 2-year option.  Note the requirement under technical 2.2.1.7 to price the nose lip separately.  This shall also be done for each of the base and option year periods.

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  

The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
			(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159.  The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  

If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  
The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment 2 is to answer questions. Should you have further questions, please email them no later than July 17, 2009, 5:00pm EST.
<p>Question: Are there any electromechanical relay upgrades included in the scope of work?</p>
<p>Answer: No upgrades are part of the scope unless they result from repairs initiated after an inspection of the electrical systems on campus finds issues that require correction.</p>
<p>Question: Have you considered breaking this into two solicitations with the first being the development of the program and the second being the implementation of the program? The difficulty is providing a line item quote for the Implementation of Electrical Maintenance Program when that program is not yet written.</p>
<p>Answer: Based on evaluations of proposals if the Government determines it is in its best interest to cancel and re-solicit separately for the Implementation of Electrical Maintenance Program, it reserves the right to do so.</p>
<p>Question: Were drawings or other site specific information made available at the site visit which would allow us to fully determine the scope of effort required to fulfill your needs? A facility electrical one-line drawing, a list of covered equipment, or possibly a map showing included buildings would be needed to gauge the level of effort required.</p>
<p>Answer: There were no drawings or other site specific information made available at the site visit. A campus map was requested during the site visit and is being provided as an attachment with this addendum. There are no one-line drawings being provided. A list of included systems on campus is provided in the Statement of Work Section B.</p>
<p>Question: Was the site visit mandatory?</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The Energy Research Group of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in collaboration with the Technical Directorate of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a municipal waste stream of degradable organic waste within a high solids inflow to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited in a landfill from an Air Force installation.
<p>The Air Force is interested in demonstrating how biogas from anaerobic digestion of organic waste can be used to offset bioreactor operating expenses or enhance aerobic decomposition of waste for the following purposes: 1) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 2) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost); and 3) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills. A crucial element of the research and development approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Influent municipal waste solids would include glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic constituents. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment.</p>
<p>Anticipated total program funding is $5.832M with multiple awards possible.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis.  Qualifications include: familiarity with the current projects related to the development of drugs for the treatment of cocaine abuse; intimate familiarity with the development of drugs as therapeutic agents; extensive and current working knowledge of radiotelemetry methods for the measuring of cardiovascular function in unrestrained conscious, freely moving laboratory animals; extensive knowledge of the development of parametric functions analogous to pharmacokinetic functions suitable for modeling the cardiovascular (HR and BP) response profile to drugs; familiarity with current methods for the analysis of telemetric data that provide an unbiased picture of the shape of the time course of action; and working knowledge of isobolographic analysis of drug combinations.
The proposed studies will analyze the hemodynamic effects induced by drugs being developed as agonist treatments for cocaine abuse, and currently under investigation in our laboratories. These drugs, with selectivity for the dopamine transporter, have the advantage of producing behavioral effects clearly differentiated from those of cocaine.  Adult (16-week-old) male rats supplied by Charles River Laboratories or equivalent will be acclimatized to standard laboratory conditions and housed in individual cages for 1 week before surgery, with free access to food and water.  Rats will be anesthetized with an intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). A midline laparotomy will be performed, and a segment (about 1 cm below the renal arteries) of the abdominal aorta will be isolated. The catheter tip will be inserted into the aorta just above the iliac bifurcation, the transmitter will be fixed to the muscles, and the abdominal wall will be sutured. After recovery from anesthesia, the rats will be housed individually in cages placed on the receivers. Gentamicin (5 mg/kg twice daily) will be administered for 2 days after surgery to prevent infection.  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be recorded and analyzed by a Dataquest 4 system (Data Sciences Intl). The system consists of BP sensors (model TA11PAC40), receivers (model RA1010), a consolidation matrix (BCM100), a personal computer, and Dataquest 4 software.  Hemodynamic recordings will be taken every 5 minutes, starting 2 hours before drug administration and for 24 hours thereafter. Each recording lasting 10 seconds, and the hemodynamic values of all cardiac cycles within this period (about 50 at baseline) will be averaged.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this notice. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NIHDA2009128 may be submitted to the NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  Carol Lindsay

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

INTRODUCTION:

This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e).  No formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation will be issued.  Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection of preference. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, is seeking qualified sources that can provide seeker systems for target recognition, and sensor correlation and like technologies to determine the current technology and manufacturing readiness levels for integration into the Tomahawk Cruise Missile. This Request for Information is required to gather data on both active and passive seeker systems that can provide target recognition, discrimination, and positive identification of ships underway at sea.  

TECHNICAL, COST AND SCHEDULE INFORMATION REQUESTED:

War-fighting Objective:

The Tomahawk Weapons System Program Office (PMA-280) is exploring the potential development of a Maritime Interdiction missile variant for the U.S. Navy, which will require the integration of a seeker.  Information provided via this request will be used to evaluate and assess the feasibility of a Multi-Mission Tomahawk (MMT) concept using the existing Tactical Tomahawk Block IV weapon system infrastructure (i.e., weapons control systems, mission planning systems, and launcher systems) that has added a moving target seeker, as well as an upgraded Weapons Data-link.  The Tomahawk Block IV is launched vertically from surface ships, and launched both vertically and horizontally from submarines.  The MMT flight profile will, depending on range, include an optimized profile outside the threat range of the firing unit (FRU) platform, and will transition to sea skim as required for threat avoidance.  The MMT will have the ability to receive in-flight target updates to aid in locating the target for execution of the terminal phase.  

Seeker Requirements and Performance:

The seeker must have the ability to acquire maritime targets, day or night, guide missile to target and provide target discrimination of various tracks and identification of the correct target within the field of view.  The maritime interdiction search area (see Figure 1) is defined as a circle covering approximately 30 square nautical miles with a total of eight maritime (white and red) vessels operating inside this search area.  The assumed scenario for a seeker enabled MMT engagement (from FRU to the target) will span (or exceed) 500 nm in a robust denied access environment due to electronic attack jamming. Complex electronic attack is expected for the missile during the endgame to include:
•	aggressive EA expected against the seeker from both the target and counter-targeting escorts in proximity to the target; 
•	GPS jamming against the missile, again from the maritime target and counter-targeting or escort vessels; and 
•	Weapons Data Link jamming against the missile and a Third Party Source which is providing real time target position updates to the missile.
Additionally, it is anticipated that within the target area of uncertainty there will exist a cluttered littoral surface target environment that may include surface-ship decoys and an aggressive electronic radio frequency (RF) environment. The MMT seeker must be capable of searching a target area of uncertainty (TAU) resulting from an assumed target speed of 30 knots (maximum), taking into account the target location error (TLE) of the third party targeting source (P-3 LSRS, P-8, E-2, JSTARS, MH-60R, BAMS), and the loss of in-flight target updates to the missile for 5 minutes prior to missile arrival at the intended target.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

•	A description and assessment of the seeker(s) technology recommended for this application including:
o	Description of the seeker aperture  technology once interfaced with the missile, and
o	Impacts to aperture design to account for launch from three missile launch configurations.

•	A description of the risk areas in the sensor system development, integration, demonstration and manufacturing program phases.

•	An assessment of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components). 

•	An assessment of the integration readiness of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components) with the Tomahawk missile and weapons system (i.e., control system and mission planning).

•	An assessment of the Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) of the seeker.

•	A detailed description of the range resolution of the seeker as well as field of regard required to recognize, discriminate, and identify ships at sea in the full range of environmental effects including: rain, fog, humidity, at full range of sea states.

•	A description of the speed regimes that the seeker is capable of operating in and the effects speed may have on the seeker capability to recognize, discriminate and identify ships at sea.

•	A description of the sensor technology capability to operate in a high threat environment consisting of electronic countermeasures and electronic support measures.

•	An assessment of the impact of an active/passive seeker on EO/IR/RF signature of the missile during entry into the target area.

•	A description of any seeker subsystem components (e.g. seeker-mode mission control processor) or functionality (e.g., image/target storage and recognition) that will be located in the missile outside the  nose section.

•	A description of how the seeker will interface with the flight computer to provide steering commands and if there is a requirement for computer storage outside the seeker subsystem.

•	A description of how the seeker will be integrated into the pre-launch sequence which includes: checks of hardware and software; loading of missile flight software, mission data and strike data; and alignment of the Inertial Measurement Unit.

•	A description of sensor information processing requirements including the data buses, speed of bus, data rate needed, type and quantity of each data type across the interface, the data itself: (e.g. navigation position update versus steering commands), the type of target/image data, and storage required for target/templates.

•	If the seeker system is dependent on outside sources for track queuing or search pattern recognition, a description of the data rates and protocols, and the correlation algorithms used to find and maintain target tracking within an area of uncertainty.

•	If the seeker is dependent on a cooling system to operate, define the cool-down time and initialization time from the time the seeker subsystem is turned on until the seeker subsystem is ready for operation. 

•	An analysis of the effectiveness of the seeker in acquiring, tracking and hitting the intended targets within the maritime interdiction search area defined in Figure 1.  Although not part of this analysis, describe how the proposed seeker would be beneficial during the land-attack mode.

•	Identify seeker and subsystem maintenance requirements (calibration, cooling system re-charging, etc.), associated schedules, and data or analysis on useful life. 
 
Figure 1.

Size Constraints:

The seeker system is expected to be integrated within the existing space available in the Tomahawk Block IV missile nose section.  The overall external dimensions of the nose section are approximately 20 inches in diameter at the aft end and 41 inches in length.  The external contour of the nose section, looking from aft-to-forward ends, slopes inward toward the vehicle centerline forming a hemispherical-like point with an aerodynamic “chine” surface.  The seeker subsystem must be located inside a sealed housing that is installed inside the nose section.  The fuel volume displaced by the seeker housing will obviously result in a reduction of the current propulsive range of the Block IV missile.  Therefore, it is operationally advantageous to keep the seeker housing volume as small as practical.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

•	A dimensioned drawing, schematic or other illustration of the seeker subsystem arranged in its sealed housing.

•	An estimate of the overall volume displaced. 

•	A description of any changes necessary to the nose structure of the missile such as radome material or window for infrared seeker.

Weight:

The weight of the potential seeker system added to the front of the missile is expected to have some affect on the vehicle’s center of gravity (CG) characteristics.  Ideally, the overall weight of the seeker system should be as low as practical.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

•	The total weight (in pounds) of the seeker system and a weight breakdown for the major components.

•	A drawing, schematic or other illustration of the seeker subsystem arranged in its sealed housing showing the approximate location of the assembly’s CG.

Power Consumption:

During the boost phase of flight the missile gets electrical power from the "CMA battery" which is a pyrotechnic activated lithium thermal battery.  Within the battery are two independent cell stacks to power the regulated and unregulated buses.  The CMA battery outputs DC power to the Power Filter Unit (PFU) before distribution to the missile components.   During the cruise and terminal phases of flight, the Block IV missile is provided  electrical power from an alternator.  The alternator is an engine shaft mounted, three-phase permanent magnet generator.  The Alternator Voltage Control Converter (AVCC) converts variable frequency AC power from the alternator into two DC voltage outputs used by the missile electrical system.  Output No. 1 is a regulated 29V (29.0 Vdc +/- 1.0 Vdc) output, and Output No. 2 is a 40V semi-regulated (26V to 43V) output.  Output No. 2 is loaded by switched loads such as the fin control system actuators and is much noisier than Output No.1.  An electrical power analysis will have to be performed by PMA280 to assess the available margins in terms of amperage available without changing the existing electrical system.  In order to facilitate such an evaluation, the electrical power requirements for a potential seeker system must be known.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

•	A narrative description of the seeker(s) electrical system including schematics, diagrams or graphs useful for conducting the evaluation described above. 

•	The expected subsystem loads in terms of worst case amperages at specified voltage(s) (steady state and transient) across each seeker mode as applicable including: power-up, searching, passive and active operations, and imaging.

•	Possible sequencing/stepping of loads such that the load required during the missile  phases of operation is minimal during:

o	Prelaunch for Built-in-Test (BIT) and image/target download;
o	Boost if needed at all;
o	Cruise for cooling and possible image/target download with continuous BIT;
o	Terminal for full seeker operation.

Environmental Conditions:

Integration of a seeker subsystem into the Block IV missile will certainly involve some qualification or design validation testing.   Existing information for a potential seeker’s capability to operate reliably in these environments will aid PMA280 in assessing the overall scope of testing required and the level of program risk.  Respondents to this RFI should provide any applicable testing or analysis information relevant to sensor storage and operation while being subjected to the following environmental concerns:

•	Temperature extremes
•	Pressure extremes 
•	Humidity
•	Rain
•	Snow
•	Sand and Dust
•	Wind
•	Salt Atmosphere
•	Salt Water Immersion
•	Acceleration 
•	Transit Drop Shock
•	Transit Vibration
•	Stowage Vibration
•	Pre-launch Vibration
•	Boost and Cruise Flight Vibration
•	Pendulum Impact Shock
•	High Impact (i.e. Barge) Shock
•	Flight Acoustics
•	DC Magnetics
•	Electromagnetic Interference, Vulnerability, Compatibility (EMI/EMV/EMC)
•	Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance
 
Cost and Schedule:

Respondents to this RFI should provide:

•	An estimate of non-recurring engineering cost of integration and demonstration in a representative captive carry environment that fully exercises the system capabilities to recognize, discriminate and identify ships underway at sea.  Provide any assumptions made regarding government furnished property, facilities or other support.

•	An estimate of the seeker subsystem’s unit cost for a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity of 40 units, followed by a Full-Rate Production quantity varying between 200 and  400 units per year on an annual procurement basis.

•	An estimated schedule for achieving TRL Level 6 in preparation for a system Milestone B review.  Describe any proof of concept and integration level testing required to achieve TRL Level 6.

•	A top level description of a program plan and schedule for achieving a mature production program of the seeker.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions. Should you have further questions, please email them.
<p>Question: How are we to go about acquiring that specification so that we know which glass to bid? The information on specifications is "Classified". How can we obtain bid docs and specs?</p>
<p>Answer: Listed under Section M-Evaluation Factors for Award you will find a description of the two-phase process. The classified Statement of Work (SOW) is not required for Phase 1. The SOW will be provided to contractors who have been selected to participate in Phase 2. Regarding all other solicitation documentation, as stated in the synopsis, "the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at the Federal Business Opportunities Website." FBO has provided a link to a list of document viewers below if you cannot open a file.</p>
<p>Question: DD Form 254 Addendum 1 states "All contractor personnel must possess a current secret clearance and be United States citizens." Does this mean that the company must maintain a 100% employee clearance rate, implying that even janitorial staff and accounting personnel have secret clearances?</p>
<p>Answer: All employees that will work on the program having access to classified information must have clearance. This includes, at a minimum but is not limited to, the company department head, Program Manager, Plant Manager, and Engineer(s)/Designer(s). Also, the production of the transparent armor must be done by a U.S. company at a plant in the U.S. and not manufactured in another country and sold in the U.S.</p>

Work assigned to these temporary positions will be done with minimal supervision or oversight, therefore we request that at least one engineer possess supervisory experience to oversee the contractor's other Junior Bio-Med Engineer.  The junior engineers will work as an independent team associated to clinical engineering department and to that end we prefer prior knowledge of PACS systems, BCMA, thermometry, and other related biomedical devices.

<DESC>Department of Veterans AffairsVISN 16Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  Department of Veterans Affairs, Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (Station 520)2.	Nature/Description of ActionThe contracting activity intends to award a contract for preventative maintenance of Fujifilm diagnostic imaging equipment located at the VA Medical Center in Biloxi MS, the Joint Ambulatory Care Center in Pensacola FL, and Mobile AL Outpatient Clinic, without providing for full and open competition.  The contract will cover a base period from October 1 2009 through September 30 2010, with two one-year option periods. 3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesThe contractor will be required to perform monthly preventive maintenance services on approximately 20 pieces of Fujifilm diagnostic imaging equipment at 3 locations within the VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System.4.	Identification of Statutory Authority(X)  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     Research Capability or Expert Services(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:The services required under the proposed contract require proprietary software which is essential to proper calibration and maintenance and accessing equipment history files required by JCAHO as documentation of equipment servicing.  This software is available only to the manufacturer, Fujifilm Medical.  Most parts assemblies required for maintenance are also only available from the manufacturer, Fujifilm.b.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:Market research was conducted but no other responsible sources were identified.  The proposed contract action will be advertised on the Federal Business Opportunities web site, with pre-solicitation notice, this J&A and the full solicitation posted.c.	If the Sole Source Exception (c) (1) was chosen, state the date of synopsis or the     basis for waivers.It is expected the synopsis will be posted on or about 15 July 2009.d. If the Urgency Exception was chosen and this J&A was prepared after the procurement action was carried out, state the reasons.N/Ae.	The above acquisition will be negotiated with:Fujifilm Medical Systems419 West AveStamford CT 069026.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable CostThe Contracting Officer anticipates the cost to the government will be determined fair and reasonable through conduction of complete price analysis prior to award of the contract.7.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.Market research conducted included internet searches for alternative capable sources and review of similar acquisitions at other locations.  Market research indicated that preventive maintenance contracts for this type procurement were typically conducted on a sole source basis.  The previous procurement at this location was conducted in 2006, advertised fully on FedBizOpps, with the sole response received from Fujifilm Medical.8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available:Although a complete statement of work has been developed, the need for proprietary software required to perform the services inhibits full and open competition.b. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent:N/Ac. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:N/A9.	Sources expressing an interest:Fujifilm Medical Systems is the only source that has expressed an interest in this procurement at the point this J&A was completed.     10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:All procurement actions will be fully advertised and offers from any qualified alternative sources will be accepted and considered.     11. Delivery Requirements:Preventive maintenance services will be performed monthly.      12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition.      13.  IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition..The assertions and recommendations in support of the justification have been prepared by://SIGNED//MARCOS G. REYES, Biomedical Supervisor 				8 July 2009_______________________________________________________________________Technical Representative                                                                      Date                       Contracting Officers CertificationThe Contracting Officer has determined that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.//SIGNED//DONALD J.

<DESC>This Amendment extends the closing date from July 21, 2009 to July 30, 2009. It also addresses questions and clarifies some questions proposed by the public.1. On Page 6. Under 1. Contractor Qualifications, it states "The contractor shall meet Joint Commision on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) Standards." The next sentence reads "The Contractor shall meet or exceed JCAHO standards and be an accredited organization at the servicing location prior to contract award as evidenced by the submision of their accreditation certificate." Does the Contractor need to meet JCAHO standards or be accredited? Meet JCAHO standards.2. On Page 15, Under 10., I., d. Equipment Specifications, it states Oxygen Concentrators should have hour meter and OCI indicator.  Is it mandatory that all concentrators have an OCI indicator?  Yes3. On Page 7, Under 1. Contractor Qualifications, is states Catchments include : Maryland  :  Baltimore, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Carroll, Anne Arundel, Kent, Queen Anne, Caroline, Talbott, Dorchester, Wicomico, Somerset; Pennsylvania  :  New Freedom, Oxford, Nottingham, Shrewsbury; Virginia  :  Delmarva Penninsula (Existing Patients Only).  There is no mention of covering the State of Delaware.  It should read the same as 18:22 below.On Page 18, Under 22. Normal Delivery / Pick Up Areas, it states Normal delivery area for the purpose of this contract is any trip to or from any location within the entire state of Maryland except Montgomery, Charles, St. Annes, Frederick and Prince Georges counties.  Minimal deliveries to Southern PA district, York, Adams, Lancaster and Chester counties, Delaware and Western Shore of Virginia (includes Accomack county).Are we to assume Delaware is covered under this contract and if so, what parts?  Southern bordering Maryland.4.	On Page 29, Under 51. Pickup and Repairs and/or Preventive Maintenance, it states Minor adjustments will be made at no additional charge.  Assuming this applies to government owned equipment, how would you specifically define a minor adjustment (price, type of service)?  We have assumed contracts involving government owned equipment in the past and inherited poorly maintained equipment.  Will equipment maintenance records be provided by the current contractor if bid is awarded to new company?  No.  Almost all VA owned equipment is issued  new.  This includes CPAP, BiPAP, Suction Machine, Humidifier.  Most often when a pm is done, the equipment is replaced.5. On Page 31, Under 55. Inventory, it states The Contractor shall maintain an inventory record of all DC VAMC owned equipment held in storage.  Does this mean the Contractor will be also be responsible for Washington, DC VAMC owned equipment?  No, this is an error.  This contract is specifically for the VA Maryland Health Care System.6. In the Schedule for Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, please clarify the following  :  a) 1. e., f., g. reference the different types of gaseous oxygen systems.  Do these numbers reference the estimated number of each type of cylinder in the patient home and if so what is the Contractor able to charge for since the solicitation prohibits demurrage charges for cylinders?  Yesthe charge is for the cylinder rental.b) 1. a., b., c., d., i., k.  Do these numbers reference the current number of patients using these equipment items (i.e. 500 total concentrator patients)?  Yes, that is the average daily census.c) 1. j., l., m., n.  Are these the annual number of set ups projected?  Yesd) 2. a., b., c., d.  Are these annual cylinder refills and liquid oxygen refill projections?  Yese) 3.  a., b., c., d.  Are these annual set up projections?  Yes7. How many of each equipment item is government owned versus contractor owned? The VA Maryland Health Care System does not own any concentrators or cylinders. The VA owned equipment is outlined in my response to question #4.Please submit all questions in writing to Cheri.Ames@va.gov

<DESC><p>A firm fixed price contract for Special Needs Transportation Services was awarded July 9th, 2009, on a sole source basis to the Spokane Transit Authority. Pursuant to 10.U.S.C. &sect;2304(c) (1), "An agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency;" and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and other other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The period of performance was July 12th - 19th, 2009, and supported the National Veterans Wheelchair Games. The award was for 1900 charter service hours utilizing a minimum of 20 "low-floor" busses. The need for "low-floor" busses allowed for rapid loading and unloading of approximately 600 wheelchair bound individuals, their care givers, and their luggage. Individual wheelchair lift busses that load/unload one wheelchair at a time were excluded from consideration due to schedule needs.&nbsp; Reference Combined Synopsis/Solicitation FA4620-09-Q-A036.</p>

<p>This opportunity is available only to the Foxmar, Inc. dba Education and Training Resources under contract number DOLJ04QA00003. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $5,954 to the Iroquois Job Corps Center, operated by Education and Training Resources. These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for Construction/Rehab on this contract.<br />It would be impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification is to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).<br />The funding is intended to correct the following facility deficiencies: HVAC Deficiencies, and Exterior Door Deficiencies. The operator of the Iroquois center will procure the services of local construction and service providers, by making these funds available through subcontracting opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations. <br />This Modification has been awarded on July 15, 2009.</p>

The Federal Highway Administration issued Task Order Number DTFH61-09-F-00061 and subsequent Modification Number 1 to Task Order Number DTFH61-09-F-00061 to provide for cellular telephones and corresponding cellular telephone service.  The Federal Highway Administration awarded this task order to Verizon Wireless as a fixed price task order under a sole source, non-competitive process.  The cellular telephone service’s part of the purchase was awarded under the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule Contract Number GS-35F-0119P.  This is a sole source action because Verizon Wireless is Federal Highway Administration Headquarters’ current cellular phone service provider.  The fixed price is consistent with the pricing and terms and conditions under GSA’s Federal Supply Schedule.  Modification Number 1 only serves to clarify the pricing of the telephones is in the open market, not under the Federal Supply Schedule, and were provided to the Federal Highway Administration at no additional cost.
