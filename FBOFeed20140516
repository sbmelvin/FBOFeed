Please note: Based on the current FAA guidance to utilize existing multi-award vehicles whenever practicable, the responses to this announcement will be a determining factor regarding whether the use of an existing multi-award vehicle is appropriate.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</strong>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (Notice of Intent) synopsis to award a Contract or Purchase Order without providing for full or open competition (Including Brand Name). The Clinical Center, Office of Purchasing and Contracts intends to award a Contract or Purchase Order without providing for full and open competition (Including Brand Name) to Cardinal Health Beltsville Nuclear Pharmacy, 7051 Muirkirk Meadows Drive, Beltsville, MD 20705 for the acquisition of radiopharmaceutical (FDA approved radioactive drug) - F-18FDG (Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose) with tungsten shielding under the authority of 41.U.S.C 253 (c) (1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The intended procurement is classified under North American Industry Classification System code 424210 with a business size standard of 500 employees. The resultant award shall include all applicable provisions in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-73) effective April 29, 2014. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.<br /><br />The Department of Nuclear Medicine (NMD) resides with in the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, a state of the art, 250-bed biomedical research hospital located on the campus of National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The Department of Nuclear Medicine Pharmacy Department requires the purchase of radiopharmaceutical (FDA approved radioactive drug) -F-18 FDG (Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose)-with tungsten shielding and delivery. The government anticipates procuring 4000 units during the base period and 4000 units during each successive twelve (12) month option period. The total award shall not exceed 60 months. <br /><br />The radiopharmaceutical shall be used for clinical nuclear medicine procedures that are critical to the missions of the NIH Clinical Center. These radiopharmaceuticals are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for use in patients. They are also radioactive materials that are regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) through the NIH radioactive material license (RAM) administered by the NIH Radiation Safety Office (RSO). Only RSO certified Nuclear Medicine personnel can order these radiopharmaceuticals directly for patient use. Each radiopharmaceutical must be properly compounded, dispensed, calibrated and delivered for a specific patient at a specific time on a specific date.<br /><br />F-18 FDG is not only a drug but, also radioactive material. In addition to meeting FDA Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, the manufacturer must also meet the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements for safe handling of these radioactive drugs. Only Cardinal Health Nuclear Pharmacy offers a patented special shielding delivery system for each individual unit dose to minimize radiation exposure to the clinical staff and the public.</p>
<p>The useful dose activity (radioactivity) of F-18 FDG decays away extremely fast (110 minutes) so it must be manufactured, compounded, dispensed, and delivered to the NIH Clinical Center at a specific required time and contains a specific required dose activity in order for the imaging/therapy study to be properly performed. For each specific patient study, the dose is unique and specific at a specific time. Since the radioactivity of this radiopharmaceutical decay away in minutes, F-18 FDG cannot be purchased in advance for storage. Each radioactive dose must be ordered on the day before the imaging study is scheduled. A specific patient dose (unit dose) of F-18 FDG is then delivered on the same day. Any delay in the ordering or shipping will jeopardize the life of the patient because the life-saving imaging/therapeutic study cannot be performed.Only Cardinal Health is able of provide this timely and dose specific service on demand on a daily basis to meet all of our requirements (quality, delivery, radiation safety).</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to procure F-18 FDG to assist in performing imaging and therapy procedures for all patients admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. These procedures are essential and necessary for the NIH clinical staff to save patients' lives and minimize their sufferings. These nuclear medicine procedures must use radiopharmaceuticals that are administered to the patients in order to produce the required images or therapeutic results. Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive drugs that are regulated by both FDA and US NRC. Procurement and use of these radiopharmaceutical drugs must meet federal regulations from both of these agencies. Only qualified vendors that meet the FDA and US NRC regulations can provide these radiopharmaceuticals for compounding and dispensing at NIH Nuclear Pharmacy to NIH Clinical Center patients.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary. The Government will not pay for any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of industry responses. Solicitations are not available at this time, and as such any requests for solicitations will not receive a response.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement by submitting their capability statement with sufficient technical information documenting the products capabilities for evaluation. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. If not responses are received within ten calendar days after this notice is published, the National Institutes of Health will pursue a sole source contract with Cardinal Health.</p>
<p>The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the closing date of this announcement. All responses must be considered no later than May 26, 2014 at 9:00AM, Eastern Standard Time. Please email Diania Robinson, Contract Specialist, at dmrobinson1@cc.nih.gov any technical questions or written responses pertaining to this notice. <strong>No phone calls will be accepted.</strong></p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Philadelphia, intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with PC Krause and Associates, 3000 Kent Avenue, St. C1-100, West Lafayette, IN 47906-1075, to procure DC Power Plant Modeling Simulation and Analysis Service Support. This is in support for the Power Conversion Module Model for Navy specifications and requirements related to a specific power distribution plant. The analysis of the models will result in further proposals to sponsors to develop and complete the power distribution plant with all required load conditions. The corresponding model is developed in Mathlab Simulink. The system contains a mixture of AC and DC power. NSWCCD-SSES shall develop DC distribution systems that are more complex and will resolve some of the current issues.<br /><br />PC Krause and Associates is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work since PCKA has extensive experience in model simulation and analysis of DC power systems. They are the original equipment manufacturer who developed distribution power plant under other Navy contracts. As a result, the proposed action cannot be processed on the basis of full and open competition since the Government does not possess full legal rights to the essential data in whole or in part.<br /><br />The Government, therefore, intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.<br /><br />The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 541690.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: 12.25pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; punctuation-wrap: simple; mso-line-break-override: restrictions">The DBDP is an extremely large scale reservoir type Hydro Power Project (HPP) which requires a significant amount of related safeguards work to be accomplished. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) will address the environmental, socio-economic and cultural situation at the project site, and identify potential significant adverse environmental and social impacts, including the project's impact on the entire river cascade and other areas of Pakistan. The ESIA will also identify and seek to propose measures to enhance intended beneficial impacts and outcomes.</p>

Substantial effort and financing has gone into the preparation of these documents. However, in order to raise funds for this mega project, it is necessary to ensure that the existing studies in terms of technical and financial feasibility and more importantly the environmental and social analyses and the resettlement plans have been prepared and conducted according to the requirements usually prescribed by international donor funding organizations.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In support of the GOP efforts related to DBDP, USAID/Pakistan has also funded "Data and Information Collection and Review and International Tender Documents for Diamer Bhasha Dam Project Studies."

The Mississippi Water Science Center located at 308 S Airport Road in Jackson, MS, has a gage located  on the Yazoo River near Vicksburg (official name is Yazoo River below Steele Bayou near Long Lake, MS, station number 07288955), where there are two obsolete pile structures that formerly held stage and velocity sensors. The structures are no longer in use and are leaning and in danger of falling into the water (see Attachments 5-8. In addition, they are a hazard to both private and commercial watercraft in the area when the water is high as they are no longer tall enough to be visible out of the water at high stage. The structures are located in the river and are only accessible by Barge.

<DESC>Secondary NAICS Code 541512-Computer Systems Design Services (Both codes are under SIZE STD=$25.5 Million) <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION:  Sources sought for a commercial, performance-based services acquisition, which may result in a solicitation for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract with two, one-year option periods.  The expected period of performance is 27 October 2014 - 26 October 2015.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gather interest, capabilities, and past performance (i.e., relevant and recent) of small business concerns (SBCs) capable of supporting ITSS_CSHCPS2 requirements for Headquarters, Department of the Army, Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1's (HQDA G-1) Office of the Assistant G-1 for Civilian Personnel (AG-1 [CP]), Fort Belvoir, VA 22060. <br>  <br> The primary responsibility of the Plans, Analysis and Evaluation Division (PAED), AG-1 (CP) is to manage the development and maintenance of the systems designed to support the CSHCPS2 in direct support of HQDA DCS G-1's mission to include the Workforce Analysis Support System (WASS), the Civilian Forecasting System (CIVFORS), and the Competency Management System (CMS).  These systems remain useful and valuable tools to the Army as it strives to meet the emerging Army Human Capital Planning and Reporting (AHCPR) requirements as outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2010 and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1400.25, Civilian Strategic Human Capital Plan (CSHCP).   <br>  <br> Services are expected to be two-fold:  1) to operate and maintain systems used by AG-1 (CP) in its mission to develop, manage, execute, and assess the Army's Strategic Human Capital Plan (ASHCP); and 2) to enhance the current CIVFORS/WASS+ into a streamlined, dynamic, holistic and user-friendly interface allowing the Army to more effectively accomplish ongoing initiatives such as Civilian  Workforce Transformation  (CWT).  The AG-1 (CP) mission includes supporting HQDA G-1 needs in the following areas:  Army CWT; AHCPR; Army Strategic Workforce Planning (ASWP); Workforce Hiring and Shaping Decisions (WHSD); and Civilian Lifecycle Competency Management (CLCM).  Specific tasks include the following:  Phase-in Period; Army Project Functions Related to Operations and Maintenance of SHCPS2; Army Operations and Support; Army Software Maintenance; Army Help Desk Support; Army Training Support; Enhancements of CIVFORS/WASS+; and Phase-out Period. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  The AG-1 (CP) and HQDA manpower officials are required to plan, program, budget, and monitor the strength of the Army.  This should be done, in part, by conducting in-depth workforce studies and analyses and by developing SHCPs based on forecasts of personnel strength (both aggregate and detail), gains and losses through the program years, and then comparing actual to projected strength, gains, and losses.  Forecasts must reflect the influences of personnel management policies in determining force composition throughout the planning cycle and quantify the number of people in given categories the Army should recruit or retain to achieve stated personnel management goals and national objectives.  <br>  <br> OBJECTIVES:  This notice briefly describes the CSHCPS2 architecture and capabilities.  The interested contractor shall demonstrate: 1) its ability to provide non-personal services related to systems operations, maintenance and sustainment including system and user interface maintenance, system and data analysis; data management; training support; project functions in addition to information assurance/security requirements; and 2) its ability to provide technical expertise to support operations and enhancement of the CSHCPS2.   <br>  <br> See Attachment 1 for an Overview of Current Army Systems and Services.   <br>  <br> Contractor Manpower Reporting Required:  Yes <br> Us Citizenship Required:  Yes. <br> Government-Furnished Equipment/Property (GFE/GFP) Provided:  Yes <br> Contractor-Furnished Equipment/Property (CFE/CFP) To Be Provided:  Yes <br> The Service Contract Act:  Applicable <br> Primary Place Of Performance:  FT Belvoir, VA <br> Travel:  Yes (Continental United States - CONUS) <br> Information Assurance (IA) Certifications and Accreditation in accordance with Army Regulation (AR) 25-2, IA:  Yes <br> Security Clearance:  Yes (Level to be Determined) <br> Compliance with Section 508 Requirements for Electronic/Information Technology (EIT):  Applicable <br> Current & Former Contracts: W91QV1-14-C-0003, as modified & W91WAW-08-D-0019, as modified (AT&T Government Solutions, Inc.) <br>  <br> Supporting documentation must not exceed 10 pages and be in the following formats: MS WORD, MS EXCEL, and/or .pdf documents.

The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry to determine if this cost arrangement would is feasible.

<DESC>SEE ATTACHMENT SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE DUST SUPPRESSION TREATMENT This is a Sources Sought Notice to identify sources that can provide dust suppression / dust abatement treatment to various unpaved roads aboard the Camp Lejeune, North Carolina Complex. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Interested vendors please provide the following information: Business Name: __________________________________________ Point of Contact and Phone Number: __________________________________________ Address: __________________________________________ Cage Code: __________________________________________ Name of Dust Suppressant: __________________________________________ Material Safety Data Sheet: __________________________________________ Please submit any suggestions, questions, comments, and/or information, including literature/brochures describing your firm's ability/interest to provide these services. Please submit responses to the Contracting Specialist listed in the attachment via FedBizOps or email. 1. INTRODUCTION This notice is to determine interested parties that can provide dust suppression treatment of unpaved locations aboard the Camp Lejeune, North Carolina Complex Unpaved roads and tank trails are approximately 16 feet wide. The locations have been previously treated annually with LIQUIDO 42% which is a Calcium Chloride (CaCl2). The Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) is currently the only product that has been approved for use aboard the installation. The unpaved roads and tank trails that require treatment are identified in the table in Paragraph 4. 2. BACKGROUND The Camp Lejeune Operations and Training Department is responsible for training to support the daily activities of various units training aboard the Camp Lejeune Complex. As a result, maintenance of the roads requires a certain amount of maintenance to include dust control and road stabilization. The purpose of dust suppression of unpaved roads is to control dust, stabilize road surfaces, improve the road surface preventing deterioration, and reduce maintenance costs. This is an annual process requiring dust suppression treatment each May/June. The Government does not have the required resources such as the chemical, equipment, or the experienced personnel to properly utilize the chemical to perform the required task. Therefore, an outside vendor, or contractor, must be contacted to perform the services for dust suppression treatments. 3. ACCEPTABLE PRODUCTS: Liquid calcium chloride (CaCl2), trade name Liquidow, was previously used for dust abatement aboard the installation for annual dust abatement. The Camp Lejeune Environmental Management Division (EMD) viewed the use of dust abatement products aboard the installation and has determined that liquid calcium chloride has minimal potential for environmental effects based on the chemical components and the history of the product&rsquo;s use on the installation. Therefore, future use of liquid calcium chloride, or any other products in the salt/brines category such as magnesium chloride, requires no further environmental review. Numerous dust abatement products are commercially available under various product names and constituents. Documented environmental concerns revealed during literature review prevent wholesale approval of these products by category. Therefore, Camp Lejeune EMD must individually review any proposed use of products, other than the salt/brines mentioned above, in order to determine whether they are acceptable for use on the installation. However, any proposed products containing waste oil components will not be considered for evaluation and are automatically disapproved by Camp Lejeune EMD. Polymer based products are automatically disapproved and will not be considered. 4. SCOPE The Contractor shall provide dust suppression treatment to various unpaved locations aboard the Camp Lejeune, North Carolina Complex. The product is to be sprayed evenly over the tank trails and unpaved roads identified below. Unpaved roads and tank trails are approximately 16 feet wide. The locations have been previously treated annually with LIQUIDO 42% which is a Calcium Chloride (CaCl2). The Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) is the preferred product for dust suppression of unpaved roads aboard the Camp Lejeune Complex. Treatment for the areas/roads shall be treated within 30 days after notification of contact award. Work shall be completed within 96 hours after commencement. The locations to be treated are listed in the table below: Tank Trail/Road Name Length (Miles) Approx.

<DESC>This Request for Information is for planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
BACKGROUND:
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States, serving over 8.3 million Veterans each year and is responsible for providing benefits and healthcare to the nations Veteran's and their families.  The Veterans Administration (VA) has designated VHA, Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) as their life-cycle requirements engineering and acquisitions oversight organization. The Applied Informatics (AI) Office within OIA works collaboratively with other VHA Program Offices and OIA components to ensure VHA Information Technology (IT) business needs are accurately identified, documented and submitted to the VA Office of Information Technology (OIT) for development and implementation.  It provides the necessary coordination to improve its acquisition and engineering practices to help enhance VA VHA OIA's ability to more effectively transition technology; and facilitate VA VHA OIA's understanding of pertinent emerging software engineering technologies.   To fulfill these roles, VHA OIA AI must develop and implement policies, processes and practices that support the VA's acquisition, development, support and retirement of critical, software-intensive systems of national significance.
In support of its mission, VHA Office Heath Informatics (OHI) requires access to the nation's best practices and expertise available.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is a not-for-profit Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), specifically established by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to focus on software and cybersecurity.  For four decades, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has been helping government and industry organizations to acquire, develop, operate, and sustain software systems that are innovative, affordable, enduring, and trustworthy.   As an FFRDC, the SEI fills voids where in-house and private sector research and development centers are unable to meet Government core technology needs.  
The SEI's core mission is to help organizations improve their software engineering and acquisition capabilities to consistently get the right software, defect free, within budget and on time.  The SEI's technical efforts operate at the leading edge of technical innovation to advance software engineering and acquisition principles and practices. 
In support of VA VHA OIA mission, vision, and goals, the SEI's engagement encompasses three primary areas:
o	Performance Improvement and Organizational Transformation - This type of work is critical to assuring that innovation and utility are considered in the deployment of effective and efficient software-reliant systems.  The research and development performed by the SEI does not just advance the state of knowledge in these areas; when applied by VA VHA OIA, it also improves the capabilities and trustworthiness of these systems.  The research conducted by the SEI focuses on exploring and creating new methods, techniques and tools; the delivery of this research to VA VHA OIA's organizational transformation applies and amplifies these methods, techniques, and tools to accelerate effective transition.
o	Technology Transition - This type of work is critical to address the challenges related to software that impedes VA VHA OIA's ability to develop, acquire, deploy, evolve, and sustain high-quality and secure software-reliant systems at a predictable performance, cost, and schedule.  Additionally, the SEI provides valuable engagement with VA VHA OIA in the form of program assessments, reviews, and evaluations that cover technical readiness, software risk, measurement, testing, and other areas. The SEI's expertise provides technology transition assistance in many areas, including:
?	acquisition and sustainment strategies and plans;
?	mission planning;
?	technology roadmaps;
?	program major milestones and baseline reviews;
?	standards development
?	prototyping; and,
?	security of network and systems.
o	Workforce Development - This type of work is critical to transitioning modern, innovative processes and knowledge to these who develop software for the VA.  The SEI develops education and training materials and delivers information through workshops, books, webinars, on-site training, virtual training, executive overviews, and other delivery mechanisms. 
Three factors make the SEI a unique resource to support the VA - the SEI's independence, the SEI's unique skill set, and the SEI's library of methods, techniques, and tools.
Independence is ensured by the SEI as it is an unbiased agent well-suited to assess the current state of any given approach, technology, or process and to provide general guidelines and recommendations to VA VHA OIA.  The software problems faced by VA VHA OIA demand broad, unbiased, and open solutions.  VA VHA OIA can rely on the SEI to provide a true, independent, honest-broker perspective and to help arbitrate among competing alternatives to find the best solution. 
The unique skill set of the SEI's technical staff comes from their expertise which crosses the lifecycle from invention to sustainment.  The SEI technical staff relies on their deep connection to government, industry, and academia when additional expertise is needed.

Across the three areas of engagement, the SEI has the ability to utilize a wealth of proprietary methods, techniques, and tools.  A representative listing is provided below:
?	Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATM) evaluation process
?	COTS Usage Risk EvaluationSM (CURE) methodology
?	Evolutionary Process for Integrating COTS Based SystemsSM  methodology
?	Framework for Software Product Line PracticeSM  guidelines
?	IDEALSM model
?	Interim ProfileSM method
?	Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM (OCTAVE) 
method
?	Options Analysis for ReengineeringSM (OAR) evaluation process
?	Personal Software ProcessSM (PSP) methodology
?	Team Software ProcessSM (TSP) methodologyHealth Systems Informatics (HSI) is an organization in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA), Health Informatics (HI) and works collaboratively with other VHA Program Offices and OIA components to ensure business operational readiness requirements of VHA Health Information Technology (HIT) needs are accurately identified, documented, and supported for deployment.  Business operational readiness support is provided prior to, during, and post-deployment of an enterprise-wide technical solution intended to enhance clinical and business informatics. HSI provides enterprise-wide leadership and strategic direction to ensure the deployment of proposed technology solutions support clinical and business processes through all planned project phases beginning with the assessment of field readiness, training, and post-deployment monitoring of technical effectiveness.

<DESC>The Recovered Chemical Materiel Directorate of the Chemical Materials Activity has the mission responsibility, as mandated by Public Law 102-484, for the disposal of all applicable chemical warfare materiel in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.  In support of this mission, the Chemical Demilitarization Training Facility (CDTF), as a Government-owned, contractor-operated facility, has been established, operated, and maintained since 1989 through present at Edgewood, MD.   This CDTF support includes providing logistics support, facility operations services, and technical training, as required by its statement of work (SOW).   <br>  <br> To continue this support for September 2015 through September 2020, draft solicitation W52P1J-14-R-0128 will be issued containing the following objectives, divided broadly into three areas:  <br>  <br> -First, provide the life cycle logistics support necessary to maintain equipment readiness and support field operations related to RCWM assessment and destruction.  <br> -Second, provide training services related to the CMA equipment used for RCWM assessment, transport, and destruction.  The training requirements include establishing and/or maintaining a research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) dilute chemical warfare agent laboratory (related to air monitoring equipment training).  <br> -Third, provide operational and maintenance support for the CDTF campus and CMA warehouses at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD and Pine Bluff Arsenal, AR <br>  <br> The draft solicitation will be issued with its umbrella and task order 0001 SOWs, in accordance with the FAR provision 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.   The primary purposes of the draft solicitation is to conduct market research for identifying interested parties and to solicit industry's comments to the Government's acquisition strategy for obtaining the continuation of the CDTF support.  The draft solicitation is anticipated to be issued, via the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE), on or after 6 June 2014; no further notice will be provided by the government on its issuance.  As such, interested parties are responsible for obtaining the draft solicitation issued via the GPE.   <br>  <br> A one-day pre-solicitation conference is scheduled to be held at the CDTF on 1 July 2014, commencing at 0800ET, in the Conference Room A of Building E-4516 at the South Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground (Edgewood Area).  In addition, a tour of the CDTF will be conducted by Government personnel; contractor attendance shall be limited to four persons per interested party.  Each interested party shall electronically provide a list of attendees, no later than five days after the issuance of the draft solicitation.   After the pre-solicitation conference, all comments and/or questions regarding the draft solicitation shall be electronically submitted by the interested parties, within twenty (20) calendar days, to the below point of contract for the Government's consideration.  The Government will provide responses to any industry's comments and/or questions to the draft solicitation via the same electronic means.    <br>  <br> The current Government acquisition strategy is to issue an unrestricted full and open competitive, best value request for proposal (RFP) that will result in a single source indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract type award, IAW FAR 16.5/DFARS 216.5, with a five-year ordering period covering the CDTF support for FYs 2015-2020.  The RFP will contain the basic contract terms, the umbrella SOW, and a master deliverable list along with the first twelve-month period of performance (POP) SOW.  Once evaluated and a successful awardee selected, the basic IDIQ contract and task order 0001 will be awarded at the same time; the award of task order 0001 will satisfy the Government's minimum ordering liability, as contained in the basic contract.  Due to the nature of the services and the uncertainty of the CDTF support, the primary basic contract type will be for the award of cost-plus-fixed-fee task orders; however, certain task orders, based on their requirements, may be awarded as a firm-fixed-price contract type.  When awarded, the CDTF support will primarily be funded with applicable O&M, subject to funding availability.  The ordering period is for 5 years, with an option to extend up to 5 more years under the authority of DFARS 217.204(e)(i).  The individual POPs, SOWs, and their corresponding task orders within this ordering period will be negotiated with the contractor; these negotiations will primarily be one-year periods of performance.   <br>  <br> The Government intends to make one award for the requirements outlined in the draft solicitation.   The Government will determine which offeror can best accomplish the requirements set forth in this solicitation.  In making this determination, the Government will conduct an integrated assessment to determine the best value to the Government using the criteria outlined in this document.  Award will be made to the offeror, whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the evaluation criteria and the requirements of the solicitation.  Consequently, integration of the technical/management area, the performance risk assessment, and small business utilization evaluation with the total evaluated price could result in award to an offeror other than that with the lowest price/estimated cost.  However, the Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of the solicitation if, upon evaluation, none of the proposals are deemed likely to meet the technical/management requirements at an acceptable level of risk and/or cost.  Award is projected on or before 24 September 2015. <br>  <br> The Government will solicit and evaluate proposals in accordance with the procedures in Section L, Instructions for Offerors, and Section M, Basis of Award, of the solicitation.  Offerors will respond to the solicitation with a stand-alone proposal, including four volumes: (1) technical/management, (2) past performance, (3) cost/price information, and (4) small business utilization.   <br>  <br> The Government is currently planning on issuing the formal RFP in the October 2014 timeframe.  Once an issuance date has been determined, the actual date will be published as a synopsis in the GPE. <br>  <br> The point of contract for this solicitation is Mr. Kevan Woodin, Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, Chemical Demilitarization Division, Rock Island, IL.  His phone number is 309-782-3961; his email is kevan.m.woodin.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br>

Then right on Cole M. Rivers Drive. <br> Right over the Rogue River past the fish hatchery.   <br> Left at intersection following signs to Rogue River Basin Project Office. <br>  <br> We strongly suggest, although not mandatory, ALL INTERESTED POTENTIAL PRIME CONTRACTORS in NAICS 237990 and/or SUBCONTRACTORS in NAICS 811310, 332811, and any related NAICS attend.  Contractors are solely responsible for their expenses for this visit.   <br>  <br> Any changes to the time, date, or location will be posted on www.fbo.gov as a modification to this Special Notice. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reserves the right to reduce the number of attendees per company should space availability present an issue. Please monitor this www.fbo.gov posting for any updates. The Government is not responsible for any expenses incurred by the contractor for this visit. <br>  <br> The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined.   <br>  <br> Purpose of Visit: <br>  <br> This Pre-Solicitation Conference is to: <br> 1.	Obtain industry input on: <br> a.	feasibility of proposed project execution plan,  <br> b.	determine reasonable timelines for construction,  <br> c.	common practices in how this is accomplished, <br> d.	alternative methodologies of assessing measurements, field alignments, and verification of dimensions within precise tolerances, <br> e.	types of tools and equipment suitable for precision field measurement, removal and installation of the seals, <br> 2.	to give an opportunity to step into the site's actual wicket gates working space while dewatered. <br>  <br> ATTIRE:  Attendees are advised to wear appropriate construction site clothing and footwear and to be prepared for inclement weather. Hard hats are required. <br>  <br> SPECIAL NOTE:  This will be the only opportunity to access the wicket gates in a dewatered condition.   Contractor is advised that the Government will not reimburse for expenses to attend this site visit. <br>  <br> The solicitation is tentatively scheduled to be issued in May, 2014.  During the solicitation period, a project site visit will be scheduled; however, both generators will be running and the wicket gates will not be accessible.  <br>  <br> Background: <br>  <br> The powerhouse has two main generators powered by vertical Francis type turbine units supplied by Boving & Co. rated at 33,800 hp at a net head of 275 feet. The units were placed in service in the early 1970's. <br>  <br> The turbine runner has 17 blades and a discharge diameter of 94 inches. Each unit has 11 stay vanes located around the periphery of 24 wicket gates, each 24.375 inches tall, that control the flow of water from the scroll case to the turbine. The access door into the scroll case is approximately 23.5 inches wide by 35.5 inches tall. <br>  <br> At the top and bottom of each wicket gate are bronze seals that are badly worn allowing excessive water leakage when the gates are closed. Each wicket gate seal is approximately 10.5 inches long, 1.25 inches wide, and 1 inch tall. These bronze wicket gate seals are to be replaced to re-establish proper sealing between the wicket gates and the top and bottom rings. <br>  <br> The magnitude of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. <br>  <br> Attendance: <br>  <br> Attendees are REQUIRED to pre-register for the conference by sending an email to Amy Wong, Contract Specialist, at amy.a.wong@usace.army.mil. The request must be received no later than 4:00 pm local time on 02 October 2013. Amy Wong may be reached at (503) 808-4608.

<p>Terrorism is defined as:<br />The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological. See also antiterrorism; combating terrorism; counterterrorism; force protection condition; terrorist; terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Antiterrorism - As a prelude and during performance of any contract, it is critical that the Contractor be supportive of all Department of Defense (DoD) requirements to protect personnel and; their families, installations, facilities, information, and other resources from terrorist acts. All Contractors and Sub-Contractors are responsible for providing their personnel information on the (JB MDL) Antiterrorism Program. During performance of work, personnel security and protection of resources is critical for the installation to maintain a safe work environment. Contractors and contracted personnel will be alert for any suspicious activities while on the installation. If any situation appears to be suspicious, immediate actions must be taken to properly notify the 87 Air Base Wing (ABW) Security Forces Squadron (SFS) Law Enforcement Desk (Dix and McGuire) (609) 562-6001, Lakehurst (732) 323-4000.

<p>Health Care: The medical treatment facility may provide urgent health care to contract employees (contract employee is not a Government employee but is a contractor or an employee of a contractor) for injuries occurring while on duty. Urgent health care is defined as medical care authorized to the extent necessary to save life or limb and prevent undue pain and suffering. The contract employee will be transferred to a civilian medical facility as soon as the contract employee is stabilized. The cost of such treatment will be paid for, in full, within a reasonable period of time, by the contract employee and will not be borne by the 87th Medical Treatment Facility, the United States Air Force or the Government. An AF Form 1127, Hospital Invoice/Receipt/Accounts Receivable Record, will be prepared to ensure collection and/or billing of charges. If a contract employee cannot pay for the treatment at the time of discharge, a statement of charges and a letter of indebtedness will be completed and billed to the contract employee for medical services rendered. An accounts receivable record will be established for each contract employee who receives medical care and is unable to pay at the time of discharge. Follow-up on accounts receivable will be completed in accordance with AFI 41-120, Medical Resource Operations. After an accounts receivable record is established and billing for outpatient medical services has occurred, the SF 558, Medical Record - Emergency Care and Treatment, will be annotated with the date of billing and the voucher number and forwarded to Outpatient Records to be filed in the medical record folder. The contract employee shall ensure that he/she provides timely notice to his/her medical insurance company and that if the insurance company is to make payment, the insurance company has adequate information and documentation to make payment. A contract employee treated in a natural disaster is not charged for outpatient care.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin<br />Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,<br />Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and<br />Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another<br />day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)<br />(See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: An employee is<br />entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.<br />at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of<br />the rate of basic pay.</p>
<p>3) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p><br />** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **</p>
<p>Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage<br />and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage<br />rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies<br />as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of<br />the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The<br />relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties)<br />contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting<br />"arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a)<br />of the regulations. This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage<br />rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST<br />CONTRACTOR SECURITY APPENDIX</p>
<p><br />87th SECURITY FORCES SQUADRON (SFS)<br />APPENDIX TO ALL STATEMENTS OF WORK FOR<br />JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, NEW JERSEY</p>
<p>INSTALLATION ENTRY CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR ALL CONTRACTORS</p>
<p>The following appendix provides information from Air Force Instruction 31-101 and local supplements on requirements for entering and conducting business while on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL), New Jersey.<br />1. Contract Award.<br />1.1. Upon award of a contract, all contractors who will be entering the installation for 30 or more days in one year., including Small Purchase contractors, must initiate a criminal history record information/background check for non-criminal justice purposes on all personnel requiring access to JB MDL to the 87th Security Forces Squadron. <br />1.2. JB MDL requires all contractors to conduct a criminal history record information/background check WITH fingerprints prior to be issued an initial long term Installation Access Pass. This check is done at the contractor's expense and not at government expense. This will be completed prior to any permanent access credential for JB MDL being issued to the contractor personnel. Subsequent criminal history checks, after the initial 3 year period, may be accomplished with a name check only. Each state must be contacted to verify if it offers this option.<br />1.2.1. If the contractor requires access to the installation for less than 30 days in one year, Welcome Center personnel will conduct a ZW Person Inquiry and issue a pass not to exceed 7 days. Prior to issuing another Visitor Pass another ZW Person Inquiry will be conducted.</p>
<p>1.2.2. If the contractor attempts to enter the installation more than 30 days in a year, they will be denied access unless a criminal history check is conducted or appropriately applied for.</p>
<p>1.2.3. A maximum of one 30 day visitor passes will be issued to anyone requesting an Installation Access Pass who is awaiting a criminal history record information/background check. <br /><br />1.2.3.1. If an individual is still awaiting the results of a criminal history record information/background check after the initial 30 day visitor pass is issued. A copy of the submitted application for the applicable state (Morpho Track Form D for NJ checks) must be presented to Welcome Center personnel to receive additional 30 day visitor passes.</p>
<p>1.2.3.2. A maximum of one additional 30 day pass will be issued to the person showing proof he has submitted the criminal history record information/background check.</p>
<p>1.3.1. This check will require the completed criminal history record/background check results or report be sent by the applicable State Police Department conducting the check to the 87th SFS Welcome Center at the following address.</p>
<p>87th SFS ATTN: Welcome Center<br />6049 8th Street<br />Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst NJ 08640</p>
<p>1.4. All applicants possessing a current driver's license in PA, DE and NY are required to have a criminal history record information/background check for non-criminal justice purposes from BOTH the State of Residence and State of Employment. Applicants with a driver's license issued in any other state need only accomplish a criminal history record information/background check for non-criminal justice purposes in the where they reside.</p>
<p>NOTE: If the applicant lives and works in NJ, then only the NJ check is needed.</p>
<p>1.4.1. General guidance for New Jersey on this process is provided by the NJ State Police and is found in attachment 1 of this Contractor Security Appendix.</p>
<p>1.4.2. General guidance for Delaware on this process is provided by the DE State Police and is found in attachment 2 of this Contractor Security Appendix.</p>
<p>1.4.3. General guidance for New York on this process is provided by the NY State Police and is found in attachment 3 of this Contractor Security Appendix.</p>
<p>1.4.4. General guidance for Pennsylvania on this process is provided by the PA State Police and is found in attachment 4 of this Contractor Security Appendix.</p>
<p>1.4.5. For guidance from any of the other state or US Territory (i.e. Puerto Rico), contact the state police of that particular state and follow the requirements of para 1.2. and 1.3. above.</p>
<p>1.5. The 87th SFS will not be used to conduct this criminal background check.</p>
<p>1.6. State Police Department background check results must be sent directly from the Investigating Agency to the 87th SFS at the above listed address. Forms sent from the contractor will no longer be accepted.</p>
<p>1.6.1. Contractors and sub contractors may contact the 87th SFS/Welcome Center at 609-754-3197 to determine arrival of and verify status of Criminal History Record and Background Checks.</p>
<p>1.7. Failure to provide the completed check for each contractor individual requesting entry to the 87th SFS will result in that specific individual not being allowed access to JB MDL until the background check has been completed and provided.</p>
<p>1.8. The contractor will provide an initial Entry Authority List (EAL) (see attachment 5 for EAL requirements) to the administrative contracting office (i.e. 87th CONS, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), NAS Lakehurst, 87th CES, etc.).

The contracting office will maintain any required documentation until the contract has been completed or terminated for any reason.</p>
<p>1.9. Upon receipt of the results of the check, the Welcome Center will review the results and determine whether personnel will be authorized to enter JB MDL. The Welcome Center will maintain and file a copy of the original documents for future reference.</p>
<p>1.10. The Welcome Center will also notify the appropriate Administrative Contracting Office or unit POC of those personnel who are being denied access to the installation because of an issue with the individual's criminal background investigation. The disposition date (date the charges were finalized in court) is the date used to determine time frames. The below criminal history findings will automatically disqualify the person in question from being granted access to the installation:</p>
<p>1.10.1. Any criminal record which is not conducive to good order and discipline.</p>
<p>1.10.2. Any outstanding warrants or personnel who are in the country in violation of immigration law.</p>

<p>1.10.6. Any conviction of firearms or explosives violation.</p>
<p>1.10.7. Incarcerated for 12 months or longer within the past three years, regardless of the offense or violation. This can be a single incarceration or several combined which total 12 months.</p>
<p>1.10.8. Any conviction of espionage, sabotage, treason, terrorism or murder.</p>
<p>1.10.9. Any conviction of DUI manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>1.10.10. Any conviction of sexual assault, armed assault/robbery, rape, child molestation, drug possession with intent to sell, or drug distribution within the past 10 years.</p>
<p>1.10.11. Any person with a pending court resolution will be denied access for any offense listed above. The disposition date (defined as the date the charges were finalized in court) is used to determine the barment period.</p>
<p>1.10.12. Any person with a pending court resolution for an offense not listed above will be issued a pass for two weeks at a time until the case is finalized in court. If the charges are dismissed the person will be considered to have a favorable criminal history.</p>
<p>1.11. The contractor will provide a final listing of personnel on an Entry Authority List (EAL) in letter format to the requesting Administrative Contracting Office.</p>
<p>1.12. The administrative contracting office (such as the 87th Contracting Squadron, the US Army Corps of Engineers, etc.) will authenticate and forward the EAL to the 87th SFS Welcome Center, NLT 72 hours prior to contract start date.</p>
<p>1.13. If EAL's are not accurate or contain fraudulent information, contractor identification badges will not be issued.</p>
<p>1.13.1. Pen and ink changes for deletion purposes may be made to an EAL.</p>
<p>1.13.2. Pen and ink additions to an EAL will not be accepted. All additions must be made by initiating a new EAL.</p>
<p>1.13.2.1. The Master EAL will be resubmitted with the additions included. Individual letters for long term employees will not be accepted if the contract exceeds 30 days.</p>
<p>1.14. The Welcome Center will maintain a copy of the documents for 90 days after expiration for future reference.</p>
<p>1.15. Contractor Criminal History Record and Background Checks will be valid for a period not to exceed 3 years. <br />1.15.1. At the 3 year mark, the contractor is required to complete a new check for each individual still employed and working at JB MDL.</p>
<p>1.15.2. Background checks older than 3 years will be updated through the NJ State Police or the State Police department for which they reside and/or are employed. Records older than three years on file will be destroyed.</p>
<p>1.16. Contractors who are also required to do Criminal History Background checks for employment purposes and maintain the background per state laws are required to bring the original completed background check and a copy of the check to the 87th SFS Welcome Center.</p>

<p>Attachment 6 Contractor Free Zone Requirements and Procedures</p>
<p>A6.1. Free zones are temporary zones without protection level resources that are created within restricted areas when construction projects and similar activities make normal circulation controls inappropriate. <br />A6.1.1. Requests to establish free zones must be coordinated with those agencies involved in the project, including the unit commander or staff agency chief having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the 87th SFS/CC and 87th SFS/S-3ISR. <br />A6.1.2. Free zones are limited in size to the minimum necessary for the contract work to be completed. The free zone must seclude the construction area from the restricted area.<br />A6.1.3. The Integrated Defense Council (IDC) approves free zone establishment and concept of operations. Free zone approval must be in writing and is maintained by 87th SFS/S-3ISR and the organization most responsible for the project.</p>
<p>A6.2. Requests to establish free zones will be submitted by letter to the IDC voting membership after routing through the unit commander having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the restricted area OPR, and the 87th SFS/CC. <br />A6.2.1. Projects within or adjacent to flight line controlled areas must be routed through 305 OSS/OSAM and Flight Safety (87th ABW/SE) prior to submittal to the IDC. <br />A6.2.2. The 87th ABW/CV is the final approving authority.<br />A6.2.3. Written requests for free zone establishment must contain the following information:<br />A6.2.4. Estimated start and completion dates of the project.<br />A6.2.5. Physical description of the area.<br />A6.2.6. Prohibited areas.<br />A6.2.7. A map indicating the requested free zone area and access routes to or from the free zone.<br />A6.2.8. An outline of security procedures to be used to ensure restricted area integrity.</p>
<p>A6.3. If a contractor is completing the work, the installation contracting officer gives the contractor a letter signed by the installation commander or the group commander responsible for the security of the area, outlining the contractor's security responsibilities.</p>
<p>A6.4. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project must watch the free zone boundary, provide escorts, and prevent unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Ensure sufficient personnel are available to provide constant surveillance for the entire free zone boundary.</p>
<p>A6.5. Entry control to restricted areas containing free zones will not be delegated to contractors.</p>
<p>A6.6. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project ensures the free zone boundary is clearly marked with an elevated rope, barrier, fencing, or other suitable material, clearly delineating it from the restricted area. Normally, the provision and placement of boundary materials and markers are included in the contract as a contractor responsibility. <br />A6.6.1. Signs identifying the free zone should face away from the free zone, so that they are visible upon approaching the free zone. <br />A6.6.2. Restricted area signs will be placed every 100 feet on the inside of the free zone boundary, visible to workers inside the free zone, clearly marking the restricted area boundary where it adjoins the free zone. <br />A6.6.3. Security forces will provide technical assistance in marking and maintaining the free zone boundary. (Note: Free zones WILL NOT be granted to replace, or granted as a convenience in place of, the need for escort officials and escorts.)<br />A6.6.4. The free zone will be closed and secured at the end of working hours each day.<br />A6.6.5. BDOC will be notified by owner/user prior to opening/closing/securing the free zone.<br />A6.6.6. Security forces must conduct a sweep of the free zone area when closed for the day in areas containing PL1 and 2 resources.<br />A6.7. Free Zones for Protection Level 4 Resources (Controlled Areas). <br />A6.7.1. Free zones are established within controlled areas when construction projects and similar activities make it inappropriate/impractical to apply normal circulation controls. <br />A6.7.2. Establish a free zone corridor from some point on the controlled area boundary to the work project to aid in moving personnel and equipment.<br />A6.8. Controlled Area Free Zones. Establish free zones when construction projects or other temporary work activities make escort procedures impractical. Follow these general guidelines.<br />A6.8.1. Allow entry to the project work area at some point on the boundary of the controlled area with a free zone corridor.<br />A6.8.2. Ensure that the responsible activity maintains surveillance over the boundary of the free zone.<br />A6.8.3. Close the free zone and secure the controlled area after normal work project hours.<br />A6.8.4. If the temporary free zone inside a CA requires contractors to complete work around sensitive equipment or materials, owner/user personnel will be present any time contractors are in the area or will have the sensitive equipment or materials removed from the area.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> HQ Army Material Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> Ft.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a sole source requirement for one (1) each Comtech EF Data satellite modem, model number DMD2050E that meets MIL STD 188-165A/B.  Due to the sensitive nature of the project for which this satellite modem will be used, only high level reasons for its requirement may be provided.  The satellite modem that is procured has to meet MIL STD 188-165A/B in order for NASA's project to be compatible with another satellite system, which is required for complete analysis of the project.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>SCIENTIFIC AND RESEARCH MISCONDUCT PROVISION<br /><br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision - <br /><br />Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment. <br /><br />Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security. <br /><br />Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America. <br /><br />Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, <br />performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion. <br /><br />Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action. <br /><br />(b) General Guidelines <br /><br />1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research <br />performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of <br />research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations <br />of research misconduct. <br /><br />2.

That Order can be found at <br />http://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/ames/administrative_orders/chapter_202/202-735-D.html <br /><br />3. Primary Responsibility. The Contractor shall have the primary responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate allegations of scientific and research misconduct. Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall promptly conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of such misconduct and may rely on its internal policies and procedures, as appropriate, to do so. <br /><br />4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an <br />administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of <br />scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct. <br /><br />5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract. <br /><br />(c) Investigating Misconduct Research <br /><br />1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall: <br /><br />a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an <br />examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research <br />misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no <br />further action is warranted. <br /><br />b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain <br />adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review <br />of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective <br />actions and sanctions. <br /><br />2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any <br />recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's <br />decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written <br />response (if any). <br /><br />(d) Findings and Corrective Actions <br /><br />1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the <br />seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall: <br /><br />a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting <br />the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other <br />parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and <br /><br />b. Coordinate remedial action with the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />(e) Department of Commerce Actions <br /><br />1. The Department of Commerce may accept the Contractor's findings or proceed with its own <br />investigation, in which case the Contractor shall fully cooperate with the investigation. The <br />Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor of the Department's final determination. <br /><br />2. The Department of Commerce reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract and applicable laws <br />and regulations. Such remedies and actions may include, but are not limited to, disallowance of costs, recoupment of contract payments, and suspension or debarment. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

https://acquisition.gov/far/index.html and www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarspgi/current/    

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and  clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government.
 

The following provisions and clauses are applicable: 

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a) The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror.  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

(i)	Technical Capability
(ii)	Past Performance
(iii)	Price

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the non-price factors.
 (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.  The technical capability to provide rental equipment meeting the specifications as defined in the Statement of Work (Factor i) and Past Performance (Factor ii) are equal to price (Factor iii).

Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the quote as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire quote unacceptable and ineligible for award. See paragraph (b) below. 

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factor (ii), Past Performance.
  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire quote unacceptable and the quote may not be considered for award. See paragraph (c) below.  

For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.   Award will be made on the lowest evaluated price. See paragraph (d) below.  

(b) Technical Capability to meet specifications as defined in the Statement of Work, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating the contractors plan to provide the equipment outlined in the Statement of Work and timeline to meet the delivery schedules.  Please submit no more than a 5 page Word document utilizing a font size of 11.
  This document shall address how the contractor will meet the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will rate the responses as follows:    

Rating	Description
Acceptable	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

(c) Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE, Factor (ii), information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance. Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for two prior same and/or similar contracts performed within the past three years.
  

PAST PERFORMANCE information shall be provided on the attached document labeled Past Performance Worksheet. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.  

Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.  If the offeror has no relevant past performance, the offeror shall submit a statement that it has no relevant related or similar past performance expereience.
 


The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL	No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Quote receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
SATISFACTORY	Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance. 
UNSATISFACTORY	Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance. 

(d) Price.  All vendors shall provide pricing for the CLINs identified and a total overall price.

(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
 Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

<DESC>The United States Small Business Administration (SBA), Office of Advocacy , has a requirement for non-personal services to expand the Office of Advocacy's access to economic data, technical expertise and knowledge (such as environmental engineering) to analyze the impact of individual regulatory proposals on small entities. This requires understanding of specific industries, the ability to rapidly accumulate industry-specific data, and the capacity to analyze this data within a fixed time period. Most importantly, the selected Contractor shall assist the Office of Advocacy by identifying regulatory alternatives, as well as data and methodologies to evaluate the costs and benefits of the agency's regulatory proposal and less costly alternatives. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), requires federal agencies to consider the economic impact for their proposed rules on small entities. If the impact, be it positive or negative, is significant, the agencies are then required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, which includes consideration of alternatives that are either less burdensome or more beneficial to the affected small entities.<br />Solicitation number SBAHQ-14-R-0010 is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for non-personal services and is attached for review.
<p>This is a total small business set-aside; NAICS code is 541690 with a small business size standard of $14.0. Contractors must be registered and active in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (https://www.sam.gov) at time award is issued and throughout performance unless an exemption exists.</p>

<DESC>The mission of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) is to reduce and protect vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials located at civilian sites worldwide.  GTRI helps the Department of Energy achieve its Nuclear Security Goal to prevent the acquisition of nuclear and radiological materials for use in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other acts of terrorism. Three key subprograms of GTRI -Convert, Remove, and Protect-provide a comprehensive approach to denying terrorists access to nuclear and radiological materials.  The Nuclear and Radiological Material Protection subprogram supports the protection of at-risk WMD-usable nuclear and radiological materials worldwide from theft and sabotage until a more permanent threat reduction solution can be implemented.  These efforts result in threat containment because WMD-usable materials are protected from theft and sabotage by installed systems and by rapid notifications to the proper authorities and overseeing agencies.<br /><br />In 2006, the Office of Global Threat Reduction embarked on a multiyear program to enhance the security of radioactive sources at civilian sites by enabling the use of a Remote Monitoring System (RMS) to support monitoring of radioactive sources using tamper indicating devices, area radiation monitoring, and cameras located in rooms or bunkers containing sources.   A monitoring system was envisioned that could communicate via redundant pathways to multiple monitoring locations to address both external and insider threats.  In 2007, the Government Accountability Office recommended that additional efforts be made to implement remote monitoring and surveillance capabilities to ensure the long-term sustainability of installed security upgrades at high-risk nuclear and radiological sites worldwide.<br /><br />Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving proposals for the development of an Integrated Remote Monitoring System (RMS), with options to purchase manufactured units over the next 3 - 5 years.<br /><br />Information regarding the goods and services required and instructions for the preparation and submission of proposals are contained in the attached Request for Proposal (RFP).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:<br /> http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Country Representative - Ukraine is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen &amp; Eurasia (YEA) Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, or his/her designee, and is based in Ukraine as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Ukraine country program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>Ukraine is undergoing a historic democratic transition against the backdrop of an escalating conflict with Russia and rising armed separatism in the east. The past several months have seen public unrest in Ukraine quickly evolve from mass peaceful protests in favor of greater European Union (EU) integration to violent clashes and demands for a new government and accountability for the crackdown that resulted in more than 80 protester deaths and at least 400 severely wounded. Negotiations between the opposition and the Government of Ukraine had succeeded in repealing harsh laws, agreeing to constitutional changes, and scheduling early presidential elections, but continued pressure from the EuroMaidan protestors and defections from the security forces and members of the President's party culminated in the dismissal of the Ukrainian President and a complete upheaval within the national government. In the wake of this upheaval, the new government has called for May 25 presidential and regional elections. A constitutional referendum is on the horizon later in the year, to be followed by parliamentary elections and local elections in the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Given the strategic importance of Ukraine and the potential fallout in the region if the situation is not quickly stabilized, USAID/OTI's program has the overall objective to help Ukraine successfully manage a transition to a more democratic, stable and peaceful state. The USAID/OTI program will seek to complement ongoing USAID/Ukraine programming. Initially, USAID/OTI intends to focus its programming in Eastern and Southern Ukraine where the greatest threat to stability and national unity lies.</p>
<p>The initial objectives for the OTI/Ukraine program will be:</p>
<p>1.	Strengthen the Government of Ukraine's strategic communications capacity. <br />2.	Improve young people's understanding of, and participation in, the transition and promoting national unity. <br />3.	Support the Government and People of Ukraine in confidence-building and conflict mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>The proposed OTI program seeks to further U.S. foreign policy interests in Ukraine by supporting a successful, peaceful democratic transition and to promote national unity in the wake of deepened social tensions.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of DCHA systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model.

<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAID's Automated Directives System);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Yemen &amp; Eurasia (YEA), or his/her designee, as well as to the Ukraine Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Ukraine program, the Country Representative is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As a part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate the Option to Extend Services under FAR Clause 52.217-8 by adding one-half of offeror?s price to the offeror?s quoted price. <BR> <BR>(a) Definition: ?Services,? as used in this clause, includes services performed, workmanship, and material furnished or utilized in the performance of services.
(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.
(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(d) If the Government performs inspections or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(e) If any of the services do not conform with contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by reperformance, the Government may --
(1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and
(2) Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.
(f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may --
(1) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; or
(2) Terminate the contract for default. <BR> <BR>a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:
(1) Drawings, designs, or specifications when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications.
(2) Method of shipment or packing.
(3) Place of delivery.
(b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.
(c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.
(d) If the Contractor?s proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.
(e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed. <BR> <BR>

POINT OF CONTACT (POC) FOR QUESTIONS IS DERRICK DARDEN, email: derrick.c.darden.civ@mail.mil or Sharon Freeman, email: sharon.l.freeman.civ@mail.mil. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and
(2) Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.
(f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may --

(c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.
(d) If the Contractor?s proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.
(e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed. <BR> <BR>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>REPORTING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND FIRST-TIER SUBCONTRACT AWARDS (AUG 2012) <BR> <BR>PROTECTING THE GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST WHEN SUBCONTRACTING WITH CONTRACTORS DEBARRED, SUSPENDED, OR PROPOSED FOR DEBARMENT (DEC 2010) <BR> <BR>Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law-Fiscal Year 2013 Appropriations.

<DESC>Diesel fuel (please see attached for details)<br /><br />Question / Answer:<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Q:&nbsp; Are there facility protocols which dictate how and where the transport will enter the facility and under what conditions ?? (i.e. a particular gate or entry point, escort, etc.)&nbsp; Also, what type of transport can be used ??<br /><br />A:&nbsp; To enter the Fountain City Service Base (FCSB) with a transport tanker, it is best to enter from the South end.&nbsp; If coming from the North it will be hard for the semi to make the bend over the train track crossing.&nbsp; FSCB will have the gate open during the fuel transfer so the contractor will have good access to the facility.&nbsp; Our normal fuel&nbsp;deliveries are 7,500 gallon semi-tractor transports.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Phillip.A.Will@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 26MAY14 0930 Pacific Time.</p>

<DESC>Initiative: Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)<br />Notice Type: Request for Information/Market Research
<p>The United States Air Force Business and Enterprise Systems (BES) Directorate (AFLCMC/HI) at Gunter AFB, AL, Enterprise Application and Integration (EA&amp;I) Division (AFLCMC/HIQ) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Defense Business System (DBS) Development Planning (DP) Branch (AFLCMC/HIQD) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting market research in support of the USAF Logistics Information Technology (IT) Transformation Sponsors (AFMC/EN and AFMC/A4) for PLM. This market research will assist in identifying Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software products that will inform an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study with the components of potential courses of action to acquire and field a PLM capability.</p>
<p>The intent of this new PLM capability is to address common access by logistics and engineering communities to product data (referred to by the PLM capability as Product Lifecycle Information (PLI)). It must also provide accurate storage and quick retrieval of unclassified PLI to support efficient configuration management, integrated engineering processes across and between program offices, timely responses to customer requests for engineering and related technical assistance, and effective engineering analysis activities. These capabilities will be focused on delivering efficient upstream acquisition activities and downstream sustainment engineering processes that result in improved supply and maintenance customer support.</p>
<p>The following PLM capability descriptions are provided:<br />&bull; Manage and Synchronize PLI - This capability will enable change, generate, store, protect, configuration control and independently deliver PLI. The PLI managed under this capability includes life cycle logistics planning data, part items, bills of material, geometry (models and drawings), technical orders, maintenance and supply and other PLI. Configuration changes to USAF-managed system and equipment end items and their PLI will be coordinated through a formal change process. This capability will synchronize PLI resulting from configuration changes within PLI processes and integrate with external support capabilities (e.g., Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO), Enterprise Supply Chain Analysis, Planning and Execution (ESCAPE), Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), supply and financial systems). This capability supports disciplined systems engineering processes to maintain configuration baselines in compliance with Operational Safety Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E).</p>
<p>&bull; Manage Engineering and Technical Assistance Request (ETAR) Processes - This capability provides a single point of access for stakeholders to request, monitor and receive assistance for enterprise development and sustainment activities. This enables a collaborative environment and standardized business process for responsible technical authorities to receive and resolve various forms of engineering and technical assistance requests. ETAR processes include receiving, tracking, prioritizing and resolving assistance requests to include initiating potential changes to PLI as required. ETAR closed-loop processes enable feedback and interaction with stakeholders for assistance requests and provide common methods to manage and report process effectiveness for continuous process improvement.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage Engineering Analytics - This capability enables the use of analytical methods, tools, and models, conditional inputs/stimulus, and reports for engineers to perform analysis to optimize lifecycle logistics planning, weapons system and equipment end item performance, and associated products and operational processes. Engineering Analytics provide information to support risk-based decisions, execute problem solving activities, and validate designs in operational or engineering environments. This capability will expedite solutions by providing authoritative analytics that are traceable, repeatable, expandable, reusable and accessible. This capability enables the assurance of OSS&amp;E and the integrity of USAF products and systems.</p>
<p>Attachment 1 is a PLM Market Survey; this survey will be used by the USAF to analyze the market for interested parties of COTS software products that may have the salient characteristics inherent in helping the USAF deliver a PLM capability. Vendors shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.<br />Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 511210 Software Publishers. "Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, which is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $35.5 million dollars in annual receipts. "Annual receipts" of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. "Annual receipts" of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52. Parties responding to this RFI are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions may apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards. <br />Responses shall include any corporate experience of implementations and/or support of other PLM systems similar to this information request. Any other relevant information or experience that would be beneficial and pertinent in the support of a PLM solution implementation should also be included.</p>
<p><br />Attachment 2 is the PLM Mission Process Map; this should be used by any interested party to see the high level relationships of Business Processes for PLM. Attachment 3 is the PLM Business Process Maps; this should be used by any interested party to identify the Business Process Activities for delivering a PLM capability.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the USAF will update this RFI in 1-2 months with an additional survey and an additional attachment to further inform an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study with the detailed capabilities of the previously identified COTS software products.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REQUESTED: Interested parties shall submit electronic responses to this RFI to the Contracting POC below by email not later than&nbsp;27 May 2014 indicating their interest by completing Attachment 1 PLM Market Survey (changes shall not be made to the format). Additional attachments to the Market Survey are not being requested. The Government anticipates that responses will come from small or large businesses and from vendors, suppliers, or implementers of COTS software products. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION is for Market Research purposes only and is being used as an instrument to identify potential sources that can provide the capabilities described within this notice. The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. The Government will use the information received to determine its acquisition strategy. Additionally, all submissions become government property and will not be returned. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI.</p>

A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /> <br />The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for several on going studies, feasibility studies, and future studies.
<p>A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  Studies within REB focus on cancer risk and other health outcomes associated with medical, occupational or environmental exposure to radiation as well as the etiology of certain cancers associated with radiation exposure (e.g. thyroid, breast, leukemia) and the radiation dosimetry to assess the cancer risks under investigation.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, REB's approach has been to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate cancer risk factor information, carefully defined radiation exposure assessments, and sometimes biologic markers to provide new insights into radiation carcinogenesis.  Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in REB research. REB is often called upon to address rapidly emerging issues in radiation exposure and cancer epidemiology through novel investigations and data sources. REB also assists in training the next generation of radiation epidemiologists, statisticians, and applied radiation dosimetrists. Approximately 12-30 studies in various phases will require support at any one time under the contract.</p>
<p>This support services contract is essential for REB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate radiation exposure, cancer risk factor information, and at times biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/DCEG/REB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining radiation dose for the purposes of identifying new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the dose-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic, radiation, and other risk factors related to cancer risk.  Thus, the support services contract will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of and experience conducting epidemiological studies and collection of biological specimens.  The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and pilot) epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the REB professional staff.  Some of the major activities of the contractor include:  <br />1) 	Obtain necessary information to determine effective study resources (e.g., capabilities of collaborating institutions, numbers of eligible study subjects, exposure information, etc.) and prepare, pretest, evaluate and produce data collection forms and specification manuals, including computer-assisted questionnaires; <br />2) 	Provide project management and assist in the coordination of multi-center studies and facilitate cooperation between NCI and its collaborators; <br />3) 	Prepare training programs and materials for abstractors, interviewers and other study personnel and procedure manuals; <br />4) 	Arrange for the collection, handling, processing, transport and storage of biologic samples or to send them to specific laboratories as directed; <br />5) 	Validate cancer incidence and cause of death by performing registry linkages (e.g., linkage with cancer registries), conducting NDI+ searches, and obtaining medical records, and have them coded by appropriate nosologists, pathologists or clinicians; <br />6) 	Collect, code, and key data from medical and radiation records; <br />7) 	Trace study subjects to locate them for interview or biologic specimen collection, to determine their vital status, and obtain other information necessary for the study with the understanding that some of the subjects were last contacted years ago; <br />8) 	Hire, train and supervise abstractors, interviewers, telephone screeners, coders, phlebotomists and others who will be involved with acquiring and assembling data; abstract, scan, photocopy or obtain records (clinical or office medical records, hospital charts, pathology reports, radiation treatment records etc.); <br />9) 	Interview subjects or surrogates using mail, telephone, computer-assisted or personal interviews; <br />10) Assist in evaluating the feasibility of integrating specific molecular components into planned epidemiologic studies; <br />11) Act as a liaison for collection of radiation exposure records and arrange for estimation of radiation doses as needed; <br />12) Arrange for laboratory evaluation of biologic material; <br />13) Enter coded information into electronic databases; <br />14) Design and maintain computer databases and associated reporting software and prepare edit programs, edit data, maintain quality control, and correct computer files where necessary; prepare analytical data files and maintain version control of files as requested by the REB staff; <br />15) Document each step of a study, including decision logs, and maintain in an orderly arrangement all relevant material so that any aspect of the study may be reviewed and evaluated by the REB staff at any point in time; <br />16) Develop and manage subcontracts for conducting epidemiologic and radiation dosimetry studies inside and outside the U.S., for specialized field procedures in the U.S., and for laboratory analyses of biologic samples.  <br />17)	Provide the support necessary to make dose measurements using soil, archived tissues, milk, teeth, blood, human-like phantoms, computerized treatment planning programs or specialized software, as appropriate, to reconstruct radiation doses to specific organs (or sites within organs) following natural, environmental, man-made, or therapeutic and diagnostic medical exposures for ongoing epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200900017C held by Research Triangle Institute.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990.  It is anticipated that one IDIQ contract may be awarded beginning on or about August 20, 2014.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted.  IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Interior, United Stated Geological Survey (USGS), installs and maintains streamgages to measure the water quality and quantity of our rivers. The Mississippi Water Science Center located at 308 S Airport Road in Jackson, MS, has a gage located  on the Yazoo River near Vicksburg (official name is Yazoo River below Steele Bayou near Long Lake, MS, station number 07288955), where there are two obsolete pile structures that formerly held stage and velocity sensors. The structures are no longer in use and are leaning and in danger of falling into the water (see Attachments 5-8. In addition, they are a hazard to both private and commercial watercraft in the area when the water is high as they are no longer tall enough to be visible out of the water at high stage. The structures are located in the river and are only accessible by Barge.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Pittsburgh District, has a requirement for security services at the Shallow Land Disposal Area (SLDA), a formerly used nuclear materials disposal site located in Parks Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.    <br>    <br> The SLDA is a 44-acre fenced site. The site includes ten trenches containing potentially contaminated waste and soil. The estimated quantities of contaminated waste in the trenches range from 23,500 to 36,000 cubic yards. Uranium and thorium contaminated wastes consist of process wastes. Equipment, scrap, and trash from the nearby Apollo nuclear fuel fabrication facility were disposed of in the SLDA trenches between 1961 and 1970. The uranium in the trenches is present at various levels of enrichment ranging from highly depleted to highly enriched. Americium and plutonium, whose presence is attributed to storage of equipment used in adjoining Parks Facility, have been detected in surface soils in the vicinity of trench 10. Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (predecessor of current owner BWX Technologies (BWXT)) previously conducted the disposals according to Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) regulations. BWXT currently holds a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) License for its activities at SLDA. A portion of that license is currently being held in abeyance to allow the remediation of the site by the USACE. The NRC license requires BWXT to properly maintain the site to ensure the protection of workers and the public. While the license is held in abeyance, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for protection of workers and the public with respect to the site.  <br>    <br> The USACE will require security services on the site 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, 365 days a year.  Two (2) armed security guards will be required on site at all times to carry out the principles of deterrence, detection, delay, and response.    <br>    <br> The following security services are required:  <br>    <br>  -Conduct and document all perimeter inspections/security patrols  <br>  -Verify that all building doors (vehicle and man) on site are secured during inspections/patrols.  If any doors are found unlocked, the security guards shall lock them.  <br>  -Monitor all foot and vehicular traffic in and out of the site  <br>  -Maintain a Sign-In/Sign-Out register at Post No. 1 of all individuals entering/exiting the site    <br>  -Ensure all visitors are approved and their identities verified  <br>  -Monitor the site for any unauthorized access  <br>  -Monitor security cameras  <br>  -Escort, either physically or electronically via the onsite Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) system, general service providers (i.e. snow removal company, Port-a-John company, etc.) who have been vetted through the USACE Security Office. <br>  <br> A Facility Clearance (FCL) at the appropriate level in accordance with DOD 5220.22-M, The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and AR 380-49, Industrial Security) and a valid Facility Cage Code are requried.  Potential offerors should contact the following individuals to initiate a Facility Clearance for this requirement: <br>  <br> Richard Noe,  richard.noe@dss.mil, 724-640-0475 <br> Timothy Bachman, timothy.bachman@dss.mil, 412-287-8709 <br>  <br> The solicitation number is required to initiate the facility clearance.  Potential offerors should not wait for the solicitation posting to begin the clearance process.   <br>  <br> The period of performance will be one base year with four one-year option periods.    <br>    <br> The anticipated contract type is a commercial, firm fixed price, performance based service contract.  The solicitation will be 100% set aside for Small Business. In accordance with FAR Part 15, the source selection method will be by the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) method.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued approximately June 9, 2014.

Contractors are solely responsible for their expenses for this visit.    <br>    <br>  Any changes to the time, date, or location will be posted on www.fbo.gov as a modification to this Special Notice. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reserves the right to reduce the number of attendees per company should space availability present an issue. Please monitor this www.fbo.gov posting for any updates. The Government is not responsible for any expenses incurred by the contractor for this visit.  <br>    <br>  The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined.    <br>    <br>  Purpose of Visit:  <br>    <br>  This Pre-Solicitation Conference is to:  <br>  1.	Obtain industry input on:  <br>  a.	feasibility of proposed project execution plan,   <br>  b.	determine reasonable timelines for construction,   <br>  c.	common practices in how this is accomplished,  <br>  d.	alternative methodologies of assessing measurements, field alignments, and verification of dimensions within precise tolerances,  <br>  e.	types of tools and equipment suitable for precision field measurement, removal and installation of the seals,  <br>  2.	to give an opportunity to step into the site's actual wicket gates working space while dewatered.  <br>    <br>  ATTIRE:  Attendees are advised to wear appropriate construction site clothing and footwear and to be prepared for inclement weather. Hard hats are required.  <br>    <br>  SPECIAL NOTE:  This will be the only opportunity to access the wicket gates in a dewatered condition.   Contractor is advised that the Government will not reimburse for expenses to attend this site visit.  <br>    <br>  The solicitation is tentatively scheduled to be issued in May, 2014.  During the solicitation period, a project site visit will be scheduled; however, both generators will be running and the wicket gates will not be accessible.   <br>    <br>  Background:  <br>    <br>  The powerhouse has two main generators powered by vertical Francis type turbine units supplied by Boving & Co. rated at 33,800 hp at a net head of 275 feet. The units were placed in service in the early 1970's.  <br>    <br>  The turbine runner has 17 blades and a discharge diameter of 94 inches. Each unit has 11 stay vanes located around the periphery of 24 wicket gates, each 24.375 inches tall, that control the flow of water from the scroll case to the turbine.

<DESC>The Department of Interior, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) in Herndon, Virginia intends to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price Purchase Order to Proton Energy Systems on behalf of the National Weather Service (NWS) Alaska Region (AR) for hydrogen generators, spare parts, hydrogen storage tanks, calibration kits, disposable cylinder, surge &amp; under/over voltage module, and maintenance kits.
<p>The equipment will be installed at the NWS Service Office Anchorage, AK. The AR staff has two and a half years of experience installing, operating, and maintaining the Proton Energy HOGEN-20 hydrogen generator. Proton is the only manufacturer of hydrogen generators with the PEM electrolysis process. The fuel cell is proprietary to Proton. NWS uses this fuel cell in Proton generators at several sites in the Pacific Region. NWS has three and a half years of experience with Proton's HOGEN-20 at Sterling Field Support Center in Sterling, VA, McGrath, St. Paul and WFO Anchorage, AK. Utilizing the same type of equipment will provide consistency in support of agency wide operations. Additionally, installing the same hydrogen generator at this location will simplify maintenance and service calls and reduce the learning curve for regional personnel operating this type of equipment.</p>
<p>AQD will use procedures that provide for issuance of the order on the basis of other than full and open competition authorized by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2). The supplies are highly specialized and market research indicates that the items appear to not be otherwise available to the government.</p>
<p>This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Information related to the potential availability of other sources that can fulfill this requirement must be received by the POC listed below no later than 2PM eastern time on Friday, June 6, 2014, POC: Nancy Moreno, Acquisition Services Directorate, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be emailed to Nancy_L_Moreno@ibc.doi.gov TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED</p>
