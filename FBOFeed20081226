This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject itemrequires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item isflight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determinedadequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only thesource(s) previously approved by the government for this item have beensolicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such thatan award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not anapproved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the informationdetailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" Naval Inventory ControlPoint Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochureidentifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company'sexperience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item youhave never made. If your request for source approval is currently beingevaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter whichforwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail toprovide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previoussubmission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not beconsidered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of asource approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/orapproval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time tomeet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continuebased on Fleet support needs. The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx" -SEE NOTES 9, 26

Engineering, manufacturing, orperformance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives havenot been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a lowprocess yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or serviceuse. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in itspresent configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source isanticipated pending configuration changes. -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THE RESPONSE DUE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED&nbsp;TO 12 PM (NOON) PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME,&nbsp;FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 2009.</strong></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) for the United States Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially available systems, government available or near-commercial technologies that may be used for Emergency Management Systems (EMS), Incident Management Systems (IMS), Command and Control Systems (C2S), Consequence Management Systems (CMS), and Decision Support Systems (DSS) related to EMS, IMS, or C2S.<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of decision support systems for fielding by Department of Defense (DoD) installations both now and in the three to five year time frame. The information obtained by this sources sought will be included in a market study that will be coupled with a hands-on evaluation to identify which system or systems should be considered by the client for fielding.</p>
<p>PNNL is assessing the market to gain information about commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and near commercial software products for potential use at installations world-wide supporting installation protection. Information about the software's ability to support local emergency response forces (military and civilian medical, fire, security forces, civil engineering, etc.) ease of use, and compatibly with existing systems will be considered. Reliability, availability and maintainability are also of interest as is compatibility with DoD standards and architectures.</p>
<p>The following capabilities, in a non-prioritized order, are of specific interest to PNNL:<br />- provide situational awareness; <br />- Geographic Information System (GIS); <br />- locate crash, spill, fire, flood, accident, attacks; <br />- accept inputs from first responders; <br />- track and display resources applicable to emergency management; <br />- generate optimal routes; <br />- determine evacuation routes; <br />- provide notification and evacuation status; <br />- track emergency responder vehicle locations; <br />- model and plot potential hazards; <br />- link facility floor plans to layout maps; <br />- provide weather information; <br />- create control points;<br />- utilize chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive (CBRNE) sensor locations, data, and alarms; <br />- provide security alarm locations and status; <br />- track and display assets, casualty locations, collection areas, and restricted areas; <br />- provide 3D visualization; <br />- generate checklists and incident reports; <br />- and support roles and policy management.</p>
<p>This RFI is divided into two parts. Part 1 includes specific requirements that must be met for candidate components to be considered for near term deployment. Part 2 is a much more open-ended request, through which the purpose is to identify promising technology of many kinds that, with additional maturation or other assistance, could be considered for deployment later in the program cycle.</p>
<p>PART 1 - REQUIREMENTS OF SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS FOR NEAR TERM UTILIZATION</p>
<p>This section of the RFI identifies requirements which must be met by candidate components if they are to be considered for near term deployment.</p>
<p>The deployment program includes a Family of Systems (FoS) used to perform a host of integrated functions. FoS components must meet criteria based on PM IPP Operational Test Concept Plan (OTCP) and operational requirements. Any component system of the FoS that connects to any DoD network must be accredited through the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) process, or the DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation (DITSCAP) process as appropriate, and ultimately be capable of receiving an Authority to Operate (ATO). COTS and GOTS responders should indicate which of their offerings are accredited through DIACAP or DITSCAP and which now have an ATO. Systems should be designed and developed with consideration given to the general and specific, mandatory and guidance documents that impact DoD programs of record. Systems will be evaluated for evidence of such consideration in the areas of architecture, data standards and formats, information assurance, and Net-Centric Services Strategy. A current ATO is evidence of such consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Open Architecture Design for the CBRN Installation Protection Program</strong></p>
<p>Open architecture solutions for the DSS architecture are required for an integrated CBRN protection and response system. Legacy sensors may be present and require integration into the DSS architecture (Portal Shield, Joint Biological Point Detection System).</p>
<p><strong>Information Management Integration</strong></p>
<p>The DSS is a central element of installation solutions. The DSS shall facilitate rapid and effective decision making, enhancing operational control and response, conducting downwind hazard prediction and facilitating rapid and effective warning and notification. Systems will be evaluated for compatible with Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIG ES) and Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) capabilities. COTS and GOTS responders to this RFI should identify which of their candidate offerings are compatible with and utilize GIG ES and NCES capabilities.</p>
<p>The DSS shall include appropriate commercial based emergency response software capabilities to ensure interoperability with state and local responders and shall permit installation specific tailoring to accommodate the specific installation map and procedures or reporting requirements unique to that installation. The DSS must be capable of integrating current and future CBRN analysis and hazard prediction models such as Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), with commercial emergency response, management tools and systems, and fixed CBRN sensors. COTS and GOTS responders to this RFI should identify which of their candidate offerings provide interoperability with commercial based emergency response software, installation specific tailoring for maps, procedures, and reporting requirements, and support integration of current and future CBRN analysis and hazard prediction models.</p>
<p>PART 2 - INFORMATION SOUGHT FOR FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE DSS</p>
<p>PNNL is requesting detailed product literature, to assist in determining the capability of software against specific requirements and future needs. Software vendors are invited to participate initially by providing information about their products. Based on the information provided and market research, selected vendors will be given the opportunity to continue in the assessment process by demonstrating capabilities of their software offering or components as needed to perform a more in-depth assessment of functional capabilities. <br />Other evaluation criteria include product maturity, interoperability with other systems and data; maintainability, expandability, standards compliance, certification or evaluation by external bodies, training support, and system costs.</p>
<p>The goal of the assessment is to identify new capabilities and evaluate existing COTS, GOTS and near commercial products against specific functional requirements and future needs. These requirements and scenarios are derived from real-world needs, usability standards, and human factors. A document detailing the specific needs, related standards and human factors will be available upon request.</p>
<p>NOTICES AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Please note that this is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. Participation does not imply any obligation by Battelle, PNNL, DOE or the United States Government or any agency thereof.</p>
<p>Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. We will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will we compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided. We will also not pay for any demonstration nor compensate any respondent for any costs incurred with development or performance of a demonstration that may be requested.</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing product literature and/or other information, no longer than twenty pages, <strong>by 12 PM (Noon) Pacific Daylight Time, Friday, January 9, 2009</strong>. Submissions will be accepted via mail, fax, or email (preferred) to the following Contracts Specialist:</p>
