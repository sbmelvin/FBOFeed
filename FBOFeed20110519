<p>Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer (MALD-J) Increment II risk reduction activities, prototyping and contractor competitive down-selects of a supplier for upgrades to the jammer module.

This 36 month Technology Development Phase will include initial ground testing, captive flight testing, and a free flight demo.</p>
<p>The MALD-J is an expendable unmanned air vehicle deployed from an F-16 fighter or B-52 bomber aircraft at standoff ranges to penetrate enemy airspace to stimulate, decoy, confuse, jam and/or saturate an enemy integrated air defense system to enhance aircrew survivability during combat operations.

FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) requires that all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All responses must be received 15 calendar days after date of post. The AFFARS clause 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.

<DESC>RFP-CMS-2011-0014<br /><br />A/B MAC Jurisdiction 5 Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction 5 (comprised of the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, Michigan, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio) on or about June 3, 2011. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is July 15, 2011 with an anticipated award date of March 1, 2012.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) intends to award a sole source contract to Avant Assessments, LLC of 160 South Park Street Eugene, Oregon 97401 in accordance with FAR 13.501(a) procedures authorized under the Test Program for Commercial Items, for a fully adaptive, comprehensive, outside-rated online foreign language assessment program for Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Italian, as well as related instructional materials and professional development. Fully adaptive means that the assessment continuously adjusts until it reaches each student's highest level of sustainable language proficiency.  Comprehensive means that it covers reading, speaking and writing.  Outside-rated means that the proficiency ratings are provided by a third-party, not a DoDEA educator.  The online medium is a requirement because the assessments must be available in each time zone where the DoDEA schools are located (US, Europe, and the Pacific). Avant Assessment is the only source capable of providing a fully adaptive, comprehensive, outside-rated online assessment program for Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Italian (See attached Statement of Work for full details).<br />
<p><br />This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any party that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement as stated herein may submit a written capability statement that clearly supports and demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement by the response date. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being solicited in accordance with FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Response Date:  4:00 p.m. EST, 17 June 2011. All inquiries must be submitted in writing by email (no telephone inquires will be accepted) to nina.lin@hq.dodea.edu with the reference control number HE125420124440002 in the email's subject line.</p>

<DESC>This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1, to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to conduct a full and open competition.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The CARTS systems is currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers. CARTS IIIE is currently operational at eleven major TRACONS, the IIE system at ninety plus sites (including Israel BGN), and the IE system at eight sites.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often with new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety. The FAA has a continuing need for software support and development of requirements as needed to ensure that system software continues to decrease the risk of accidents, incidents, and traffic delays, while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements.  The current contract, with Lockheed Martin Transportation & Security Solutions, is set to expire September 30, 2011 and the awardee of the follow-on contract must be capable of meeting the requirements of this survey.  At this point, the FAA knows of one company (the incumbent) that can meet these requirements.  The FAA anticipates the award of a follow-on contract for equipment, software, maintenance, and engineering services with a period of performance consisting of approximately 72 months.
The CARTS follow-on contract will be a sustainment contract with a primary focus on software activity until the long-term terminal automation convergence under the Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement (TAMR) program is completed.  The agency believes restrictive data rights to certain CARTS software exist and the awardee must either have data use rights or have access to it.  The CARTS follow-on contract is strictly limited to maintain the current CARTS IIIE, IIE and IE systems and the specific requirements identified for sustainment until they are replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any vendor that believes they can meet the FAA's requirements must submit a response that identifies and describes the skill sets and company resources listed here:

<DESC>Requirement: The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, Northern Hawaiian Islands, has a request for construction services to perform stabilization work on the historic Seaplane Hangar on Sand Island of Midway Atoll.Midway Atoll is located approximately 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii.
Provide all necessary personnel, equipment and material to perform stabilization work on the Historic Seaplane Hangar. The Seaplane Hangar is a World War II-era steel-framed structure that is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is roughly 53,000 SF in size and 50 ft high at its highest peak. It suffered significant damage during the war (one half of the building was destroyed) and considerable deterioration due to lack of maintenance throughout the years. It is still used as a storage facility by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Work needs to be done to stabilize the building and extend its service life. More specifically the work includes: the abatementof asbestos containing materials and lead based paint; the repair and replacement of 1) primary and secondary structural steel components and assemblies, 2) cementitious roofing panels, 3) metal siding, 4) wood framed structures, and 5) selected architectural finishes; and demolition of portions of the structure.
The cementitious roof panels shall be completely replaced with a galvanzied metal roof panel.  A modified bitumen roof with a spray on epoxy coating shall be applied over the whole roof. 
Due to a shortage of housing on Midway Atoll housing facilities shall be provided by the contract. Three options shall be considered: 1) Provide Design/Build services to demolish an existing barracks building, Purchase and Install a New Modular Motel Accommodations on the same footprint of the recently demolished Bravo Barracks. 2) Furnish and install 30 Weatherport Tents along with remodeling The Internet Caf with additional sanitary bathing and laundry facilities and 3) refurbish three existing buildings to bunkhouse standards. .
Because of limited funding and logistical constraints of doing work on Midway Atoll the stabilization work shall be awarded as a task order contract to be completed in multi-year phases. 
PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: All construction related work is located on Sand Island of the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Work on the project can begin after Notice to Proceed is given. The period of performance for the initial phase shall be 360 days from award of contract. Additional time shall be added to the period of performance as additional phases are added to the contract.
INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: The work shall be done in accordance with all applicable nationally recognized codes and standards as published by the International Code Council (ICC) such as International Building Code (IBC), International Plumbing Code (IPC) and the International Mechanical Code (IMC) as well as the National Electric Code (NEC), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM). The work shall be accepted when all the work is completed as described here within and in accordance with any contract specifications. Work will be inspected to assure compliance with the contract documents. But quality control and adherence to all contract requirements is still the responsibility of the contractor.
GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS/INFORMATION: Contractor will be able to use available heavy equipment on island such as manlifts, cranes and front end loaders when agreed upon by Refuge Staff. Note that only certain equipment (heavy equipment, hand tools, some golf carts) will be available 25% of the time though, as other contractors may also be using this same equipment.  Contractors requiring pieces of equipment more than 25% of the time will be required to rent their own and ship to Midway. 
AVAILABILITY: Normal duty hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. Work shall be performed during these hours unless prearranged with the Refuge Manager. Federal holidays not included.
ACCESS TO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS: The Solicitation with Clauses and the Notice to Offerors and various attachments will be available through the FedBizOpps web site (https://www.fbo.gov/) and Fish and Wildlife Service FTP website (https://manage.fws.gov/ftp_r1cgs_solicitations/F11PS00775).  
Requirement is unrestricted and will be open to any size business.  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220.  The small business size standard for NAICS code 236220 is $33.5 million.  
MAGNITUDE:  More than $10,000,000.00
WAGE RATES:  The Davis Bacon wage rates do not apply to this location. 
PHASE 1 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR CONTRACTORS SELECTED TO ATTEND SITE VISIT:  An initial evaluation will be conducted to determine up to five (5) of the top ranked firms that will be eligible to attend the site visit.  These five (5) firms selected to attend the site visit will be the only firms eligible to submit a proposal on the project thereafter.  No other contractors will be eligible to submit a proposal.  At least one contractor representative will be able to attend the site visit and possibly up to two personnel per contractor if seating is available.  Evaluation factors for phase 1 will be based upon submission of past performance and experience data over the last ten (10) years of up to at least five (5) current and completed contracts that are similar in nature to this project and conditions encountered at Midway Atoll NWR as addressed in the Statement of Work and Drawings, remote island experience with large steel buildings, key personnel working on the construction team and experience with modular construction.  Page limitations for proposal responses will be specified in Section L of the solicitation pacakge as well as the notice to offerors page. 
CONTRACTORS SELECTED UNDER PHASE 1 TO ATTEND THE SITE VISIT AND SUBMIT A PROPOSAL: The decision of contractors selected under phase 1 is anticipated during the week of July 11, 2011.  Contractors selected under phase 1 to attend the site visit and submit a proposal must provide the names of a primary and secondary person planning on attending the site visit to the Contracting Officer within two days after notification of the selection notification.   Due to the limited seat availability (only five (5) seats currently available on the flight from Honolulu to Midway), it is possible only the primary person will be allowed to attend the pre-site visit.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor at least fourteen days in advance as to who will be able to attend.  A flight has been scheduled to Midway for August 2 2011 and returning on August 3, 2011.  Personnel attending the site visit will be required to have passports. 
**Please note that this flight schedule is dependent upon any weather delays that may occur.  Contractors will be responsible for covering the cost of flying to Honolulu and any overnight accommodations.  Contractors will also be responsible for overnight food on Midway.   
SOLICITATION EVALUATION FACTORS FOR CONTRACTORS SELECTED TO ATTEND THE SITE VISIT:  Those initial five (5) top ranked firms that are chosen to attend the site visit will be asked to provide a proposal to evaluations factors stated within the solicitation package.  The solicitation package will be issued on or about June 6, 2011 with receipt of proposals due approximately July 6, 2011.   Basis of award for contractors selected under phase 1 to attend the site visit and submit a proposal will be lowest priced, technical acceptable. For determining lowest price, the governemt will review proposals received and make a selection of going with one of the three housing choices listed above.   The price of that housing option will then be added with the combined total of phases 1 through 5 to determine lowest priced proposal.  Starting with the lowest proposal received, the work plan submitted will be reviewed to determine whether the technical approach is viable.  If a determination can not be made on acceptance of the work plan of the lowest priced offeror after receipt of clarifications, the evaluation panel will then move on to reviewing the next lowest priced proposal received, and so, until we end up with the lowest priced proposal that also has an acceptable work plan approach that shows an understanding of all aspects of the project and the challenges such as logistics required to accomplish this multi-year phased project. 
Interested contractors must complete online representations and certifications application (ORCA) at "http://www.bpn.gov" and must be registered in CCR at http://www.ccr.gov to be eligible for an award.   
Bonding:  For contractors selected under phase 1 to attend the site visit and submit a proposal, a bid bond is required with submission of their propsoal.  Successful awardee will be required to submit a one hundred percent payment and performance bond within 15 calendar days after award of the contract.
PASSPORTS:  Successful awardee will be required to have passports for employees.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 1 Pacific, is preparing to issue a solicitation for commercial services to perform project management support as well as aerial and ground based mechanical and hand rodentcide application and rodent presence verifications for a rodent eradication action to be performed at Wake Atoll (Wake, Wake Island, HI) in accordance with an approved interagency Operational Plan and Environmental Assessment that has been previously developed with coordination between the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the US Air Force.
This requirement will support the US Fish and Wildlife Service through an anticipated fixed price contract to be awarded and administered solely by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and does not include a cooperative aspect between contractors and agencies or Bureaus.  However, contractor and Federal agency coordination to adhere to contractual schedules, timelines, and project parameters within the operational plan will be required to ensure the project is completed successfully at its conclusion.
The requirements of the project will be for the contractor to provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, materials  tools, supervision, specialized services,  reporting, and logistical operations to perform dedicated helicopter and personnel support services to support the US Fish and Wildlife Service(in coordination with the US Air Force) during a rodent eradication project on Wake Atoll.  Requirement is for rotary-wing aircraft only, with the additional requirement of personnel to perform project management, supervision, and support for the contractors operations to perform the eradication project.  
SET-ASIDE: N/A-Full and Open Competition
NAISC: 481219 Other Non-Scheduled Air Transportation
SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD: $7M
Project Location:Wake Island (also known as Wake Atoll) is a coral atoll having a coastline of 12 miles (19 km) in the North Pacific Ocean, located about two-thirds of the way from Honolulu 2,300 statute miles (3,700 km) west to Guam 1,510 statute miles (2,430 km) east. It is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States, administered by the Office of Insular Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. Access to the island is restricted, and all current activities on the island are managed by the United States Air Force. There is also a missile facility operated by the United States Army. The largest island (Wake Island) is the center of activity on the atoll and has a runway of 9,800 feet (3,000 m).
Project Overview:Two species of rats (Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), Asian house rat (Rattus tanezumi)) were inadvertently introduced to Wake as early as 1941.  Rats are known to depredate seabird eggs and chicks, native plants, and other invertebrates, and cause damage to electrical wires, contaminate stored consumables, are a public nuisance and pose a potential health threat.  
On August 28, 2006, the United States Air Force evacuated all 188 residents and suspended all operations as category 5 Super Typhoon Ioke headed toward Wake. By August 31, the southwestern eye wall of the storm passed over the island, with winds well over 185 miles per hour (298 km/h), driving a 20-ft (6 m) storm surge and waves directly into the lagoon inflicting major damage.

<DESC>The Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Center, 1481 W. 10th St., Indianapolis, Indiana intends to negotiate with South Western Communications to provide installation of the Rauland Nurse Call System within the newly renovated GI suite.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). The Government believes that only one (1) responsible source can provide the supplies/services based on the fact that South Western Communications has installed the Rauland system within numerous areas of the medical center and having another company install would not only void the current warranty with South Western on the newly installed equipment but would also bring in a different system that would be incompatible with the Rauland System and hinder functionality and patient care.  
 
This notice is not a request for competitive quotes, but responses received on or before June 2, 2011 will be evaluated. A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is only within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Georgetown University Hospital, 3800 Reservoir Road, N.W., Washington, DC  20007 for a collaboration on a specialized training of clinical fellows for research in psychiatry of complex medical illnesses.  

The Office of the Clinical Director is part of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program (NIMH-DIRP).  The DIRP conducts clinical research designed to expedite the exchange of information between scientists and clinicians so that basic findings can be moved quickly from the laboratory setting to the treatment of patients at the bedside.  Clinical research, including natural history protocols and clinical trials, is of primary importance to the research mission of the NIMH.  The clinical research portion of the program comprises tenured and tenure-track clinical investigators, staff clinicians, and fellows in more than a dozen clinical Branches and free-standing Sections.  There are approximately 120 NIMH protocols, which accounted for approximately 7,000 inpatient days and 7,000 outpatient visits in FY10.  The mission of the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) is to ensure that subjects participating in NIMH protocols receive the highest quality clinical care.  

The proposed acquisition will provide the Office of the Clinical Director with residents specializing in psychosomatic medicine, a subspecialty of general psychiatry, from Georgetown University in a collaboration providing these residents with access to subjects participating in clinical research in the NIH Clinical Center.

Georgetown University Hospital, under the auspices of MedStar Georgetown Medical Center, is a premier medical research institution.  This institution offers future physicians a superior and supportive environment for learning the science of medicine.  In addition, Georgetown Universitys Psychiatry Department offers particular faculty expertise in psychosomatic medicine in areas that supplement researchers at the NIMH.  Georgetown University can provide residents that are trained in psychosomatic medicine.  The University sponsors a new, highly competitive, advanced clinical training program in the area of expertise for its training partners, the NIMH Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Service which is part of the NIMH-DIRP and Washington Hospital Center.  The residents have previously been competitively selected and accepted for this specialized program.  

The training will provide the OCD with specialized services to assist in the provision of care with the following services:

-Assessment, treatment and follow-up of research subjects with psychiatric disorders in conjunction with ongoing studies in other NIH intramural research programs;
-Implementation of diagnostic plans to complement multidisciplinary treatment plans; and 
-Psychotherapeutic intervention for research subjects in inpatient studies.

In addition, this training offers NIMH an opportunity to work with highly skilled clinicians who can contribute to the research mission of the NIH and its Intramural Research Program.  

Georgetown University Hospital has previously worked with NIMH in collaboration on these specialized training programs and is thus the only source available that will satisfy the agencys requirement.

The period of performance is five (5) months from the date of award.  The place of performance is NIH Main Campus located in Bethesda, MD. 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 2:00 PM E.T., June 3, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.

The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><br />NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service has a requirement for sea surface temperature (SST) oceanographic monitoring stations, technician services, data delivery, and transportation. The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, and equipment necessary to perform the Statement of Work. Performance of work is scheduled on a task order basis. The contract is contemplated to consist of a period of performance from on or about September 9, 2011 to September 8, 2015, with a base year and three one year option periods.
<p>This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334519 and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center has a requirement for sea surface temperature (SST) monitoring devices in support of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED). The SST monitoring devices will be deployed in various sheltered, semi-exposed, and fully exposed locations in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), American Samoa, the Line and Phoenix Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and other atolls and islands of the Pacific. The SST monitoring devices should be capable of measuring and recording highly accurate temperature data. In addition, hourly SST data shall be provided to NOAA on a near-real-time basis. The monitoring devices shall remain operational for 24 months or longer. The major monitoring station system components (buoy, data logger, transmitter, sensors, etc.) should be re-useable for greater than three two-year deployments with routine maintenance and refurbishment between deployments.<br />The successful return of high quality data, both telemeter and downloaded from the instrument, is a high priority.<br />The systems shall be small and light enough to be easily deployed with the use of small boats (5-7 m) and SCUBA divers. The water depths for the deployments will be between 1 and 40 meters, with typical deployments in less than 25 meters. The stations may be deployed in protected lagoons, on reef flats, or offshore of islands or atolls. The stations may be deployed in exposed areas and must be capable of withstanding climatological weather and sea conditions for the duration of the deployments. Winds in these areas are typically moderate to strong with mean wind speeds of about 8-10 m/s. During storm events, much higher wind speeds are expected (&gt;25 m/s). The tidal range in these areas is expected to be about 1 m. It is possible that storm surges could elevate these ranges. The moorings are likely to experience potentially strong tidal currents, surges, or currents associated with wave run-up over the reef. Exposed locations may experience 3-4 meter seas with extreme events generating swells of 8-10 meters. Attempts will be made to deploy the moorings away from any potential breaking waves, and to position the systems where mean currents are not expected to exceed 1.6 m/s. <br />The monitoring stations may be deployed in marine protected areas (MPA) and other environmentally sensitive locations and the stations should be designed to minimize any environmental impact.</p>
<p>The work will be described and assigned in the contract Statement of Work, any of which are subject to change at the Government's discretion upon issuance of the solicitation. Some of the potential requirements are the following: 4 estimated each year of the contract sea surface temperature (SST) oceanographic monitoring stations with data transmitting capabilities; 640 estimated hours each year of the contract technician services; 48 estimated per month of each year of the contract data delivery; and 1 estimated each year of the contract transportation.</p>
<p>All responsible and fully responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. Any resulting contract will be awarded as an IDIQ firm-fixed price contract. Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or around June 3, 2011 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps [Add To Watchlist] and [Add Me To Interested Vendors] features which provide a notification when the RFP becomes available for download as well as all postings of information associated with this solicitation, thereafter. Each potential offeror is responsible for checking the FedBizOpps website to gain all current information related to the solicitation. The solicitation and any further announcements regarding the solicitation will be posted only at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Anthony Buch at anhony.r.buch@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http:///www.ccr.gov/. Please also ensure your firm registers in CCR for this solicitation's NAICS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought as well as a mechanism for obtaining feedback from the industry in regard to the general requirements as stated in this Notice. THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a Request for Proposal. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. Interested sources should provide a capabilities package not longer than 10 pages demonstrating ability to perform the services listed below. Potential sources may submit resumes or personnel information plus information specific to their company including name, point of contact, size of business, and company profile. In addition, the potential source should include any pertinent information on contracts that have been performed by the company, similar in size and complexity to the effort contemplated below.
<br /> The U.S. Department of Treasury created the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) in October 2008 to stabilize the financial system by providing capital to viable financial institutions of all sizes throughout the nation. With a strengthened capital base, financial institutions have an increased capacity to lend to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy.<br /><br /><br />Treasury has acquired preferred stock and subordinated debt in CPP institutions and the corresponding legal right to appoint two members to the Boards of Directors&nbsp;for certain institutions. Contractor support is required to develop placement criteria for board positions, develop candidate lists/search books, formally present candidates to Treasury, and conduct background investigations. Treasury has legal the right to appoint two members of these institutions Board of Directors when an institution has missed six consecutive dividend or interest payments. Accordingly, the Treasury requires the services of an executive placement firm to assist in recruiting qualified individuals to serve on Boards of Directors.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the contractor shall, as directed, assist Treasury with the sourcing and selection for members of Boards of Directors for certain institutions in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) by providing the following services:</p>
<p>1. Assist Treasury with the development of placement criteria. The criteria shall include education, experience, preliminary information required for a conflicts of interest check and other relevant suitability criteria.</p>
<p>2. Provide Treasury with a candidate list/search book of potential candidates that meet or exceed the criteria established through number 1 above.</p>
<p>3. Formally present candidates selected for additional consideration by Treasury.</p>
<p>4. Conduct background searches on all candidates, based on criteria that will be provided by the Treasury after the award. Background criteria will include searches related to criminal history, credit checks, civil judgments, publication review, education and employment history as well other checks deemed necessary by the Treasury.</p>
<p>The procurement will require the ability to identify, recruit and place a high volume of board of director candidates for financial institutions spanning the entire country. Specifically, here are the limitations:</p>
<p>1. Geography - It is highly likely that the search firm will be working on multiple assignments concurrently for positions that are throughout the country. Therefore, it is mandatory that an acceptable provider has deep, nationwide reach.</p>
<p>2. Volume - Treasury may have as many as 80 placements going on at any given time. Treasury needs a firm that could take on up to 80 placements simultaneously, working on very condensed timelines, while juggling other clients they have.</p>
<p>3. Range of Specializations - Treasury has a wide variety of institutions in its CPP portfolio that are different sizes, have different corporate structures and service different communities. This requires the contractor to have a deep bench of expertise and be able to provide expert advice on a wide range of situations.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to conduct this procurement in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 15. The resultant contract will be awarded on a best value basis. At this time, a solicitation is not available. All responses must include the following information: Company name; Company address; Company business size; point-of-contact name and telephone number, fax number; and e-mail address. Interested sources that do not provide the requested information will not be considered.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing construction services for the following project for Dry Dock No 1, Concrete Wall and Floor Repairs, NSS PORTSMOUTH NAVY SHIPYARD KITTERY, MAINE 

Description of proposed project:  

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  The intent of this notice is to identify potential firms capable of providing services for the stated project.  This project is to repair Dry Dock #1 concrete walls, caisson seat, concrete floor, and concrete floor drainage structures.
 Replace Pumpwell #1 heating, ventilation, and dehumidification system. Dry dock repair will include removing spalled, weakened concrete and damaged reinforcing steel until sound concrete is found. Once sound concrete is found, the repair will continue with replacing reinforcing steel and re-forming and replacing concrete walls, floors, seats, and drainage structures. Pumpwell work will involve replacing large heating and ventilation air handlers and replacing dehumidification components. 
Additional Information:  The existing condition of Dry Dock #1 walls and floor consists of reinforced concrete that was constructed in 1941-1943. The floor slab and walls have sufficient weight to resist hydrostatic uplift pressures and the dock is certified for 30 long tons per foot.
 Current test bores of the concrete show areas of un-bonded course aggregate. This inferior concrete is causing much of the surface cracking and spalling seen on almost the entire surface of the walls.
Poor drainage is a contributing cause of excessive spalling of the floor. The dry dock pumpwell is critical to the overall safety of the Fleet's submarines and shipyard employees. The equipment in the pumpwell is responsible for all auxiliary and main dewatering as well as flooding alarms and controls. The pumpwell is heated with a steam coil heat exchanger which had to be taken out of service this winter due to leaks.
It could not be repaired. Temporary portable electric heaters were used to provide heat but were not adequate.
 The existing dehumidifiers do not control the environment satisfactorily and several electric actuators and a motor controller have failed.  


All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.

Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.  This office anticipates award of a contract for these services in May 2011.  The appropriate NAICS code for this procurement is 23.
  
THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
  

This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and ultimate issuance of an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>13--Market Research and Request for Information (RFI)
For AEODRS Prime Systems Integrator In Support of Increment 1 of the Advance Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotic System

<SOLNBR>N0017411S0017
<CONTACT>Jessica Scalfaro, jessics.scalfaro@navy.m.il

<a href="mailto:jessica.scalfaro@navy.mil">jessica.scalfaro@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 requires the Government to conduct market research before developing new requirements documents for an acquisition.  Results of market research are used to determine whether qualified sources exist and whether commercial items are available to meet the requirement.

One of the ways the Government conducts market research is to issue a Request for Information (RFI).  A RFI provides a broad statement of need, briefly describes the Governments intention regarding program/acquisition approach, and identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule.  

Description
This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey on services for a Prime Systems Integrator (PSI) for the Advanced Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotic System (AEODRS) program.
  This RFI is led by PMS 408, EOD/CREW Program Office, Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare (PEO LMW).  It is not a Request for Proposal.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

PMS 408 plans to partner with and use an AEODRS Prime System Integrator (PSI) to successfully contract for and integrate commercially available third-party innovator hardware, software and firmware modules and components.  

The AEODRS Prime System Integrator would be responsible for validating component and module technology maturation levels (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 minimum and higher) and for providing component, module, and system-level installation, integration, testing, measuring and reporting with the intent to meet formal, approved government requirements.
  This work is required to prove successful performance of new or different components and modules installed into the product baseline system architecture.  PMS 408 is issuing this RFI in order to gain an understanding of industrys technical capabilities, knowledge, experience, ability and interest to execute the AEODRS Prime System Integrator concept. The PSI shall establish an Integrated Product Team(s) (IPT(s)) to address factors affecting the program. The PSI will serve as an advisor to the existing government configuration management infrastructure. 
Background
The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) community has demonstrated the operational viability of ground robotics and the criticality of this technology to the protection and preservation of human life.
 However, the rapid evolution of robotic technologies and the pace of advances in computer processing power and capacity, coupled with the lessons learned from field operations, have resulted in the recognition that the limitations of currently fielded and planned improvements of existing EOD robots will reach a point of diminishing returns and reduced capability in the near future. As a result, multiple notional concepts have been submitted from EOD operational forces identifying the need for an Advanced EOD Robotic System (AEODRS). Specifically, the facility of tele-operation to replace human intervention and the inclusion of higher levels of autonomy will dramatically reduce risk to personnel and improve mission effectiveness.
  

The first AEODRS variant, Increment 1, is configured to enhance dismounted EOD operations in remote locations, or when Joint Service EOD forces are directly supporting maneuver forces in the anticipation of an incident (e.g., EOD counter-IED support to dismounted patrols). 

AEODRS will comply with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Aerospace Standard (AS-4) (formerly known as Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS)) specifications and DoD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) Guidelines. Hardware capability modules will be commercially developed components modified to meet Government mandated physical, electrical and logical interfaces.

PMS 408 EOD/CREW is using an Open Business philosophy and approach to extract maximum benefit from a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA).
  The AEODRS open business acquisition strategy leverages the benefits of open architecture design elements to create the means for third-party technology innovators to participate in a coherent development, procurement and validation of system and sub-system level technology insertion /technology refresh (TI/TR).  PMS 408 EOD/CREW plans to conduct Block Upgrades in response to user driven requirements, advances in technology and in response to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).   

Interested parties are invited to request the AEODRS documentation package. The documentation package describes the common architecture being used as well as the performance specifications and interfaces for the modules that make up the dismounted operations variant.
 The documentation package is being made available as part of continued communication with industry, academia, and other Government agencies regarding the AEODRS program. Requesters should note that the documentation package subject to change after the release without notice. The Government anticipates future releases of the documentation package which will be announced separately. To request the documentation package provide your name, company/organization name, address, telephone number, and email address to Jessica Scalfaro at jessica.scalfaro@navy.mil


Requested Information
The respondent is requested to provide information on the following:
(a)	Industrys recommendation in executing AEODRS Prime System Integrator activities within the Government specified system architecture.
 
(b)	Industrys experience within the past 3 to 5 years as a System Integrator, identifying how the company effectively solicited, competed, executed and managed multiple sub-contractors and vendors at various tiers under one contract to include delivery and integration of components, flow down of specifications, testing requirements, configuration management, block upgrade support and warranty management. 
(c)	Identification of risks to the Program and the PSI.
(d)	Identification of cost drivers to include infrastructure and resources.
(e)	Demonstrated past experience in the role of System Integrator.

<CONTACT>Ellen T. Crain, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9679, Email ellen.crain@disa.mil
<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI) for<br />DISA Establishment of Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Services</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), DITCO-Scott PL8311, P.O. 2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p>Description<br />THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR THE DISA ESTABLISHMENT OF A MOBIULE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR (MVNO) COVERING THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO SUPPORT EXTENDING ENTERPRISE UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS TO MOBILE DEVICES.</p>
<p>1.0 Background<br />The government is seeking to extend enterprise unified communications (real-time presence, messaging, and voice) to mobile endpoint devices locked to an MVNO providing third and eventually fourth generation network service. This MVNO would offer data services only with encrypted Voice over IP (VoIP) services being provided by the enterprise using this link.</p>
<p>In addition to real-time media services, the Government acting as an MVNO seeks to actively manage and monitor the security of endpoint devices (smartphones, Wi-Fi bridges, tablets, etc) while minimizing the overall attack surface exposed to adversaries. The Government sees this as a niche telecom business ultimately servicing Federal, State, Local, and Tribal agencies. The RFI is issued as a means of technical discovery and information gathering. We seek to (1) validate that the Government's Mobility program as described above constitutes a valid telecom niche and (2) characterize the steps, resources, and lead time required to establish a MVNO that leverages the host Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to obtain global reach. DISA is seeking this information from industry, particularly MNOs and Mobile Virtual Network Enablers (MVNE).</p>
<p>2.0 Request for General Information<br />1. Describe your organization (MNO, MVNO, MVNE, etc). Do you manage your own network operations?<br />2. How many MVNO launches has your organization directly participated in?<br />3. Describe your experience with and expertise in developing MNVO business models.<br />4. Describe your experience with and expertise in developing MVNO technical architectures and implementation plans. What is the largest MVNO you have been involved with?<br />5. Describe your experience with and expertise in developing procedures and mechanisms for provisioning and managing MVNO subscriber equipment.<br />6. How well has the Government identified a legitimate market niche that can be addressed by a MVNO as described in Section 1? How would the business model work to achieve this goal?<br />7. Describe your experience in implementing security and device management for MVNOs noting any experience with Open Mobile Alliance standards</p>
<p>3.0 General Technical Requirements<br />Ideally the MVNO should be capable of supporting the following operational requirements.<br />&bull; Support for 1 million or more subscribers<br />&bull; Segregation and isolation of MVNO subscribers from the PSTN and the global internet<br />&bull; Restrict service offering to particular handset devices (locking)<br />&bull; Centralized provisioning of endpoint devices including SIM cards (if applicable), device programming, etc.<br />o Generation and storage of all cryptographic keys for over-the-air updates, etc.<br />&bull; Centralized security management of endpoint and infrastructure devices (eg. remote wipe of data-at-rest encryption keys, policy enforcement, device integrity, etc.) including ability to accept, deny, remediate, or block devices from communicating with the MVNO.<br />&bull; Centralized management and deployment of device firmware and operating system updates.<br />&bull; Dedicated or otherwise engineered backhaul connectivity to Government data centers hosting enterprise unified communications services.<br />o Mobile endpoint to enterprise connectivity via an always-on IPsec VPN connection with no split tunneling carrying<br />&#61607; Secured Unified Communications Signaling (eg. SIP) over TLS<br />&#61607; Secured Unified Communications Media (eg. G.729 voice) over DTLS-SRTP<br />&bull; Enforceable Quality of Service measurements for ensuring packetized voice quality<br />&bull; Deployment of MVNO picocells or femtocells in isolated and low-coverage areas<br />&bull; Robust subscriber management and billing capabilities<br />&bull; Detailed reporting on the physical location (Lat, Long. plane only) of MVNO subscribers</p>
<p>3.1 Request for Technical Information<br />1. How would you architecturally isolate MVNO subscribers from the PSTN and the Internet when users are roaming on another network?<br />What interfaces, if any, would be exposed to the PSTN or the internet?<br />2. How would you ensure that backhaul to Government datacenters is segregated and protected?<br />3. Is it possible for MVNOs to administer Access Point Names (APN) to differentiate user communities among the subscriber base?<br />4. How would you restrict MVNO services to a particular list of endpoint devices?<br />5. How would you identify and/or remove non-approved devices operating on the MVNO?<br />6. Is it possible for the MVNO to fully control what updates get applied to devices? Applications? Is this device or OS dependant?<br />7. How would an MVNO manage services like key management for data-at-rest or "full device" encryption?<br />8. Describe the provisioning process for MVNO subscribers and subscriber equipment. Attention should be given to the division of labor between the MVNO, back-end enterprise, and the host MNO. How flexible is this division of labor?<br />9. How can quality of service be enforced for packetized voice? Address both MVNO and roaming connections.<br />10. How would the MNVO deploy picocells or femtocells to isolated and/or low coverage (eg. office buildings) areas?<br />11. Can you provide a notional architecture diagram showing the key hardware components and an overlay to that diagram showing functional roles provided by the hardware?<br />12. Have you integrated any mobile-handset anti-virus or network access control products within an MVNO before? Are there products in this space yet?<br />13. Given an MVNO of some 1 million users, can you provide a rough (order of magnitude) estimate for monthly network bandwidth required to support VoIP and data (email, messaging, web access)?<br />14. To what level of detail would you be able to provide information on the apparent physical locations of MVNO subscribers as they access the network? Address both MVNO and roaming connections.<br />15. Are you able to provide MVNO subscriber location information in near-real time? If not, with what delay?</p>
<p>4.0 Request for Business and Logistical Information<br />This section assumes a notional MVNO with the number of subscribers exceeding 1 million.</p>
<p>1. Describe the steps and timeframe for establishing the MVNO.<br />2. Describe the business relationships required to enable domestic and international roaming.<br />3. Estimate the non-recurring start-up costs for the MVNO.<br />4. Describe the supply chain and business relationships required for the MVNO to offer particular endpoint devices (eg. Smartphone, WiFi bridges, and tablet computing devices).<br />5. Describe the work-flow and estimate cost associated with stocking, provisioning, and equipping an MVNO subscriber with a particular device.<br />6. Estimate the typical monthly recurring airtime (data only) costs assuming we are extending enterprise unified communication services (VoIP, e-mail, messaging, web access) to MVNO subscribers.<br />7. Describe the processes surrounding billing assuming both the "unlimited" and pay-go models.<br />8. Estimate the number of full-time equivalents required to operate the MVNO.</p>
<p>5.0 MVNO Support on Long Term Evolution (LTE) Networks<br />1. Will an LTE network be capable of hosting a MVNO? Please provide a timeline for your roll out of LTE capabilities to your network if applicable.<br />2. Provide an architecture diagram that shows the changes required to migrate a 3G MVNO to an integrated LTE capability. Please include the Radio Access Network (RAN) and evolved packet core (EPC) network elements by vendor and model wherever possible.<br />3. Do you have plans to (or how would you) upgrade or migrate to new systems in the EPC to support advanced subscriber data management functions? What vendors have you considered for these systems? <br />4. When do you anticipate circuit switched voice services will be removed from your LTE network?<br />5. Have you or do you intend to implement packet switched voice service using an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)? Do you see IMS as an important component in a MNO business strategy? What applications are you planning to provide through IMS? How would an MVNO incorporate IMS?<br />6. What are your plans for implementing additional security in a core network? Do you see the need to deploy IPSec for network domain security?<br />7. Do you have any security concerns about the increased use of femtocells and home e-nodeB s in LTE?</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and&nbsp; (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><br /><strong>Background:</strong> The Office of Child Care (OCC) falls within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The OCC supports low-income working families through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2010, the OCC awarded $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants. States and Territories invest $1 billion each year in quality improvements.<br /><br />Each State, Territory and Tribe appoints a Lead Agency to administer the CCDF funds. These Lead Agencies make decisions about CCDF priorities, policies, and expenditures, including: determining eligibility requirements, setting family co-payment levels, establishing provider payment rates, setting target populations, and prioritizing quality investments. States, Territories and Tribes are required to complete a comprehensive planning process every two years, and to provide information on child care policies to ACF in biennial CCDF Plans.</p>
<p>OCC recognizes that efficient, well run programs enhance access to services for eligible families and children and create a key link in the education of young children and the self sufficiency of families. The National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability will provide technical support that combines strong policies that support access, quality, and accountability into a holistic framework. Subsidy administration encompasses a wide range of activities that may include, but is not limited to, program management and governance, strategic planning, policy review and development, community partnerships and business practices. Program integrity involves the strengthening of accountability while continuing to preserve access for eligible children and families. The center will coordinate activities that combine subsidy administration and program integrity through coordinated technical assistance activities. The intersection of these two areas will help ensure that child care subsidy programs are being managed in an efficient and effective manner and that limited program dollars are leveraged to benefit the low-income eligible families for which assistance is intended.</p>
<p>OCC has established a Child Care Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF. In the years 2007-2011, CCTAN projects included: After-School Investments; the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning; Child Care Aware; Child Care and Early Education Research Connections; the Child Care Information System Technical Assistance Project; the Communications Management Center; Healthy Child Care America; the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center; the National Infant and Toddler Child Care Initiative; the Tribal Child Care Technical Assistance Center, and the Child Care Improper Payments Initiative.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, OCC will reorganize its CCTAN to specialize its technical assistance (TA) in core areas, including the following new projects: the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement; the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives; the National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability; and the State Child Care Systems Specialist Network. This Sources Sought notice only addresses the requirements and minimum capabilities for the National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong> The purpose of this contract is to create an integrated technical assistance framework that provides valuable support to Lead Agencies in their efforts to:&nbsp;<br /><br />- Develop and maintain a strong subsidy administration that promotes policies and implementation strategies that are child-focused, family-friendly, and that work in partnership with child care providers; and&nbsp;<br /><br />- Increase accountability and integrity of programs to ensure that program dollars are utilized appropriately and efficiently to promote high-quality services and best serve the low-income eligible families for which assistance is intended.</p>
<p>While the specific topics for new technical assistance will evolve based on current needs, input from stakeholders and the CCDF Plans and goal setting, OCC's objective is for the technical assistance, consultation, training and materials under this contract to help States and Territories work toward four core goals:</p>
<p>1) A higher proportion of low income children, in particular children who receive child care subsidies, served in higher quality care.<br />2) Increased stability and continuity of subsidy receipt and quality child care arrangements to promote families' financial security and children's development. <br />3) An adequate and stable supply of high quality providers.<br />4) Strong program integrity in the context of CCDF.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Requirements: <br /></strong>The Contractor's staff will have expert level knowledge of how CCDF program and policies are administered at the state level; and operational knowledge of and expertise in the broad areas covered by the Center, including the full range of issues and services and new directions within the child care field. <br /><br />The Contractor will employ a project director with relevant experience in managing projects of this scope and complexity, preferably with CCDF issues and subject matter experts that have formal education experience in the administration of high quality early childhood development and school age services and program integrity efforts that intersect with subsidy administration. <br /><br />-&nbsp; The Contractor will share information and coordinate efforts, as appropriate to advance state level system development and integration, with the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives, and National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement. <br /><br />-&nbsp; The Contractor will have expert knowledge, expertise, and capability to support the maximum use of technology and distance learning for ongoing communication, knowledge gathering, knowledge sharing, including demonstrated experience in developing web ready material and populating websites.<br /><br />-&nbsp; The Contractor will be able to both manage the contract and operate the Center in-house, and through the use of OCC approved consultants and/or subcontractors. Specifically, key personnel must be employees of the Contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance:</strong> The period of performance will include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Other Important Considerations:</strong> The Contractor is expected to work closely with the OCC and ACF, provide ongoing support, and participate in CCTAN meetings and topical subcommittees, and other activities that involve OCC staff that take place regularly in Washington, DC.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Teaming:</strong> Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>

<DESC>DEVICE FOR DECOMPRESSION AND TACTICAL EN ROUTE CARE OF SUSPECTED PNEUMOTHORAX IN COMBAT / AUSTERE SETTINGS<br><br>The Combat Casualty Care Research Program of the Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) provides integrated capabilities for far-forward medical care to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with major battlefield wounds and injuries. The USAMRMC is seeking information regarding small bore needle/ trocar decompression devices which are capable of providing rapid initial decompression and en route care maintenance of clinically-suspected tension pneumothorax for use by combat medics and medical professionals in the austere battlefield environment. Interested firms should submit a 1-3 page whitepaper (with additional sheets for diagrams as necessary) describing such devices and the concept of use. Information will be reviewed pursuant to consideration for the development of a request for devices to be tested. As such, any descriptions of clinical use or test and evaluation studies will be of use. Both commercially-available as well as proposed designs are considered appropriate.  For the purposes of this request for information, we anticipate that devices:<br><br>1)  Possess an internal bore diameter smaller than or equal to 4mm / 12 French;  <br><br>2)  provide rapid decompression in the event of the presence of tension pneumothorax; <br><br>3)  possess the capability to remove the needle / trocar while leaving-in-place a flexible, minimally-invasive tube, catheter or other channel capable of occlusion via stopcock or similar mechanism and capable of maintaining or re-establishing patency without repetitive needle punctures, for serial chest decompression during tactical evacuation if clinically warranted;<br><br>4)  may be utilized in multiple trauma scenarios, including blunt and penetrating thoracic trauma; <br><br>5)  could potentially be utilized to decompress and temporize a massive hemothorax prior to placement of a tube thoracostomy;  <br><br>6)  capable of being attached via adapter to either luer-tip or Toomey-tip syringe for active manual suction; <br><br>7)  Can be used easily in a tactical environment with a minimum level of familiarization <br><br>8)  encased in a crush / break resistant container with non-glare finish in an earth tone color <br><br>9)  Be of light weight; <br><br>10)Have long shelf life, low cost and low cube/weight with minimal space impact on medic bag.<br><br>11)heat stable <br><br>

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs- Veterans Benefits Administration- Loan Guaranty

Request for Information (RFI)


THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY (as defined in FAR 15.201(e)), this is not a solicitation. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.

Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Loan Guaranty is gathering data on Veterans and Service-members (SMs) whose VA-guaranteed home loans foreclosed, and who were subsequently evicted from their homes. VA intends to use this information to assist in its strategic initiative to prevent and end Veteran homelessness. Specifically, VA wishes to obtain information about housing tenure options and outcomes in post-foreclosure, post-eviction scenarios. To that end, VA has issued this RFI to gather input from all interested vendors in crafting a meaningful and implementable research plan that will allow us to answer the research questions listed below.    

Current Status: Loan Guaranty administers a home loan benefit program to eligible Veterans in the form of a loan guaranty given to private lenders that issue mortgages to Veterans with generally no down-payment. In the event of a foreclosure on a VA-guaranteed loan, VA typically pays the lender the amount of the borrower's indebtedness plus the guaranty, and then often acquires the property. In recouping this expenditure, VA seeks to resell the property as quickly as possible, at the highest price possible. This allows VA to offset foreclosure-related losses, and to restore the maximum amount of eligibility to the foreclosed Veteran. Although VA and loan servicers work to avoid foreclosure whenever possible, having saved over 76% of defaulted loans from foreclosure in FY 2010, foreclosures, and subsequent evictions do occur. As part of the eviction process, VA can offer relocation assistance to soon-to-be displaced Veterans; but currently, VA is not able to track the housing outcomes of these displaced Veterans. 

Information Requested and Specific Questions to be Addressed: The Government is requesting that all interested vendors provide information and ideas regarding their recommended approach to, and capability for, gathering information directly from, or about Veterans and their housing options and housing outcomes in a post-foreclosure, post-eviction scenario. VA may ultimately seek answers to the specific research questions listed below. 
 
1.	What are the most common housing outcomes for Veteran and Service-member homeowners after a foreclosure and eviction? How does this compare with the tenure options and outcomes of similarly situated borrowers in the general population? 

2.	With what frequency do Veterans and Service-members go homeless or end up in a homeless shelter, post-eviction? 

3.	What are the major predictive variables that determine post-eviction housing tenure (e.g. employment or marital instability, mental health issues, general demographic characteristics etc.)? 

4.	What policy options might be employed to mitigate these predictive variables, improve housing tenure outcomes, and to ensure that Veterans and Service-members avoid homelessness? What barriers might VA encounter in implementing such policy options? 

Vendors' responding to this RFI should provide detailed information on an overall strategy/approach that could be taken in seeking answers to these questions. Vendors should also include a description of the methodology they would utilize in conducting a project such as this, and information on past projects and research of similar nature and scope that would serve as preparatory for a project of this nature, or that could be leveraged to assist VA in obtaining answers to the research questions. VA is also interested in learning about the capability available and methodology used by vendors in collecting difficult-to-find or sensitive information from the public. This would include the data and IT systems resources available to collect and analyze this information.    

VA may utilize the responses to this RFI to conduct additional market research. It is possible that the VA may invite some respondents to meet with VA officials in person for oral presentations and/or question and answer sessions. Information obtained in this information request may be utilized to assist VA in developing a Request for Quotation (RFQ) or a Request for Proposals (RFP). 

Submissions: All submissions must be submitted electronically, via email, to Allen Smith, Contract Specialist at: allen.smith3@va.gov.

Submit responses as attachments in Microsoft Word (.doc) or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf). Please limit all responses to no more than 30 pages, 12 point font minimum, single spaced. Responses should be submitted on or before June 24, 2011 at 3:00 p.m.

Questions: Any questions should be directed to Allen Smith, Contract Specialist, at allen.smith3@va.gov. E-mail communication should include company name, point of contact, address, phone, and fax number.

Note: VA will utilize the information in this RFI to help determine the Agency's next steps. The vendor should identify any proprietary information in their RFI responses. Proprietary materials will neither be distributed to nor discussed with any other vendor. The use of information submitted to the Government as a result of this RFI will be at the discretion of the Government. The information obtained from responses to this RFI will remain confidential insofar as permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.
 




52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)

(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Shipping containers must comply with state and federal regulations.  This includes DOT, DOE, USNRC, and ICC regulations and standards. 

Because of the critical need for these supplies in a timely manner, only a vendor that can supply the radiopharmaceuticals on an "as needed basis" to the VA in Albuquerque, NM can be used.  The radioactive medicines have a very short time (half life) once they are received by the VA to be used.  F-18 for example has a viability of only 30 minutes.  Once this time has been exceeded, this radioactive medicine is unusable.  Other radioactive products, once prepared, can be used up to a maximum limit of about six (6) hours.  The period of performance for deliveries is date of contract award through September 30, 2011. 

Below is a list of radiopharmaceuticals that the VA in Albuquerque, NM will be ordering:

F-18 FDG                                          
F-18 NaF                                          
133 Xenon vials                              
123 Iodine capsules                       
99Tcm MAG3 doses

131 I therapy doses Graves Dis. 
131 I therapy doses, Cancer

<SUBJECT>Loan-level mortgage datasets

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), intends to negotiate sole-source procurement with CoreLogic and LPS/McDash for&nbsp;loan-level datasets&nbsp;at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 1801 L Street NW, Washington, DC. The Government intends to award a&nbsp;firm fixed priced contract&nbsp;for a base period and&nbsp;4 option periods.<br /><br />The CFPB Mortgage Markets group has the following duties which require mortgage loan-level data:<br />&bull; Establish empirical rulemaking records for numerous upcoming, statutorily-mandated rulemakings and reports to Congress and the public (the first of which will be the Qualified Mortgage rulemaking, for which the Public Notice and Comment period ends 7/22/2011);<br />&bull; Monitor mortgage market trends (including financial, industry structure, credit risk, product development, demographic, geographic, etc.) and report significant findings pursuant to Section 1022(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act using data-driven analysis for issues affecting consumer welfare;<br />&bull; Evaluate policy options, recommendations, and impacts; and<br />&bull; Conduct long-term quantitative research in mortgage loans (in partnership with Research). <br /><br />To conduct such functions, Mortgage Markets needs appropriate mortgage loan-level datasets. In a four-month study of available mortgage loan-level datasets, we concluded that only CoreLogic and LPS/McDash (in combination) will suit all of these needs. Our conclusion is based on the following investigation:<br />&bull; Assembled a team including two researchers who had conducted peer-reviewed multivariate regression studies using the major competing loan-level mortgage datasets;<br />&bull; Identified major research questions the Bureau needs to answer;<br />&bull; Worked with Urban Institute consultants to evaluate mortgage data addressing those questions;<br />&bull; Met with finance economists from the Federal Reserve Board, HUD, the FDIC, FHFA, the Wharton School, Harvard Business School, other leading business schools and economics departments, and the Pew Trust to discuss their mortgage data needs and solutions; and<br />&bull; Participated in a federal interagency mortgage data task force to explore long-term solutions to public mortgage data.<br /><br />The output of that investigation was a determination that any dataset would need to meet five essential criteria: (1) provide loan-level data, (2) combine origination data with loan performance data, (3) provide broad, comprehensive market coverage, (4) be reported in a timely fashion, and (5) have significant, proven data integrity with substantial support provided by the vendor. <br /><br />A sole source to CoreLogic and LPS/McDash is intended for this order. No existing dataset meets all of the required needs. There are five large mortgage loan-level datasets in wide use: HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) &amp; HMDA Plus, OCC-OTS Mortgage Metrics, CoreLogic Loan-Level Servicing Data, LPS/McDash Mortgage Performance Data, and BlackBox:
<p>While no single dataset will meet our required needs (given the requirement for broad market coverage over a combination of origination and performance data), by combining CoreLogic and LPS/McDash, we can achieve broad market coverage in conjunction with the other four required criteria. No other option provides the same coverage, time lag, and data integrity at the loan-level.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to CoreLogic and LPS/McDash. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase for eight (8) months to Dr. Diana Solovyeva.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, requires a the services of Dr. Solovyeva for the Kigigak Island spectacled eider study protocol.
Back Ground:The threatened spectacled eider population is composed of three disjunct breeding populations that breed in Russia, on the Alaska's North Slope, and on the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.  The majority of the world's population breeds in Russia, and data collected from Russian breeding grounds may help determine the cause behind the significant population declines observed in this species in Alaska.  Results could lead to implementation of recovery efforts for the US breeding populations.  Because of the difficulty of collecting data in Russia by DOI scientists, the only feasible means of collection such data is by working directly with Russian eider experts.
Dr. Diana Solovyeva is a prominent Russian waterfowl biologist.  She is widely regarded as an eider expert and has conducted research on spectacled eiders in Arctic Russia.  Dr. Solovyeva conducted a pilot study in 2002 on Ayopechan Island in the Chuan Delta and conducted the first 7 years of the project (2005-2005, 2007-2010). Due to Dr. Solovyeva's expertise and involvement in the study since 2003, there are no other comparable researchers who could conduct this research in 2011.  The consistency of this research project depends on Dr. Solovyeva's continued involvement for its successful completion. 
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accepts proposals received.

<RESPDATE>061011
<CONTACT>Claudia G. Melgar, Phone 3014923487, Email Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with Jack Tills &amp; Associates (JTA) for Containment Knowledge Transfer &amp; Support. The scope of work will include:
<p><strong>&bull; </strong>Systematically collecting and categorizing containment studies such as International Standard Problems submittals, nuclear plant licensing audit reports, CONTAIN/MELCOR code validations and code benchmarks previously performed by JTA;<br /><strong>&bull;</strong> Providing training to NRC staff and other interested entities on MELCOR applications for nuclear plant containment analysis;<br /><strong>&bull;</strong> Peer review containment assessment activities; and<br /><strong>&bull;</strong> Provide technical assistance related to complex containment analysis issues to the NRC.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be 24 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>JTA is the only contractor uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work under this requirement for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. The knowledge base and containment analysis experience at the NRC staff level and at Sandia National Laboratory (the MELCOR code developers) are somewhat limited. Moreover, as part of this transition phase, JTA will be available to peer review significant on-going MELCOR code application activities, e.g., small module reactors. Note this project is on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>2. JTA has continuously supported, and been the major contributor to NRC's mission in the containment analysis arena for nearly 30 years. JTA has a long history of being involved in NRC sponsored work particularly focusing on containment thermal-hydraulics <br />(i.e., since 1983 as a subcontractor to Sandia National Laboratories, and periodically contracting directly with the NRC). JTA has been involved in numerous projects and plant specific studies: such as 1) the Containment Performance Improvements (CPI) program; 2) participated in various International Standard Problems (ISPs) in which containment codes are assessed against selected integral experiments; 3) assessed the CONTAIN and MELCOR codes against experimental test programs for new and advanced reactor containment designs (e.g., AP1000, ESBWR, EPR etc.) and performed nuclear plant assessments; 4) analyzed all existing types of containment designs including ice condenser designs, and analyzed the associated experimental test programs; and 5) supported various NRC's international containment analysis initiatives.</p>
<p>3. As a result of the above experience, JTA's efforts embody the bulk of the accumulated containment analysis knowledge base and Mr. Tills is a recognized expert in the field of containment thermal-hydraulics with an understanding of NRC's licensing framework, and has assisted various NRC offices such as RES, NRR and NRO. No market research was performed because the primary purpose of this project is to capture and transfer containment analysis knowledge and experience only available directly from <br />Mr. Tills before his impending retirement. The transfer of this knowledge base and experience may increase the possibility of competition for subsequent acquisitions for the same or similar services.</p>
<p>4. The NRC staff estimates another contractor would require a minimum of 20,000 total staff hours at a total estimated cost of $2 Million and 10 years to have sufficient knowledge and experience in containment analysis to successfully perform this project. This project must commence in August 2011 and be completed by August 2013. Thus, it is impossible for another contractor to obtain the necessary knowledge base and experience spanning 30 years, and commence and complete this project on schedule. Moreover, the duplication of effort and associated cost is not expected to be recovered via competition.</p>
<p>5. JTA possesses unique and broad capabilities which are essential in performing this proposed project to capture and transfer Mr. Till's experience before his impending retirement. Given his previous experience of nearly 30 years with the project, it is reasonable to conclude that JTA is the only source that has the necessary knowledge, staff, skills, and technical expertise to successfully complete this project timely and efficiently.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Claudia G. Melgar, Contract Specialist by phone at 301-492-3487 or via email to Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov.</p>

<DESC>Your professional services are requested as a Contract Counselor for the U. S. Department of State's Career Transition Center (CTC) Job Search Program (JSP).
<p>The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center of the Department of State is the federal government's primary training facility for personnel of the foreign affairs community. The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the Department bureau that provides training for employees of the Department of State and other agencies at the Shultz Center. The Career Transition Center offers two major programs to help employees plan for the future and prepare for retirement: The Retirement Planning Seminar (RPS) and the Job Search Program (JSP).</p>
<p>The professional services of a Contract Counselor are needed to help with the transition of the JSP participants from widely varied areas of the Foreign Service and Civil Service in the Department of State and other Foreign Affairs agencies, and include employees who are being voluntarily and involuntarily separated from service with the government. Each participant is beginning a transition to a new life outside the institutional structure they have known. They vary in expertise, rank, race, gender and age, with most being in the range from late-40s to late-60s. Their post-retirement plans are diverse, and their geographic targets include overseas as well as US locations. Some are seeking employment in the private sector; others are interested in not-for-profit organizations or related areas of government service, or educational sectors, and/or part-time or volunteer employment. Some are uncertain of their next steps, and are using the JSP to help them formulate their plans for the future.</p>
<p>The Job Search Program helps employees clarify career goals, assess skills, prepare a resume, build a network of people who can help in finding a job, sharpen interviewing skills, and negotiate salary and benefits. JSP class sizes range from 55 to over 100. The program is offered three times each year, generally in March, August and October. The August 2011 class size is unusually large, over 140. The small group ratio of counselors to participants is 1:8.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***<br />***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-47.***<br />*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted, and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***<br /><br /><br />PURPOSE:<br /><br />The Magnetics Group requires a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance--(NMR) system upgrade. Currently, we use an antiquated hybrid (Bruker-Tecmag) NMR spectrometer console which is fundamentally limited by the electronics available at the time of its manufacture. A modern spectrometer would allow us to continue using our current NMR superconducting magnet, room temperature shims and probe, while simultaneously expanding our capabilities to include the use of magnetic field gradients for the purpose of diffusion measurements and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (specifically MRI microimaging). In addition, the improved electronics of a new spectrometer will better enable us to use our cryogen-free magnet for NMR and MRI, as well as opening up a range of NMR and MRI techniques currently unavailable due to the limitations of the current spectrometer. These capabilities are in line with the goals of the BioMagnetic Imaging Program within the Magnetics Group, which is actively working on diffusion phantoms for quantitative MRI standards, as well as complimenting efforts in NMR/MRI microcoil design. Because of our interest in quantitative measurements at clinical MRI field strengths (1.5, 3, and 7 tesla), it is important that a new console being able to function at these field strengths.</p>

<p><br />Technical Capability, and Past Performance, when combined, shall be approximately equally important as Price.<br /><br />Technical Capability:<br />Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the Offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an Offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.<br /><br />Past Performance:<br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the Offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS has a requirement for a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and HIV-related viral co-pathogens. The program must ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials.
<p>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking a contractor to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and HIV-related viral co-pathogens. The program must ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials by providing laboratories with validation and proficiency testing panels and real time assay run controls, and analyzing proficiency panel and assay run data from each laboratory. The contractor must also plan and execute single and multi-laboratory studies for the evaluation and development of new and existing virologic assays and supporting statistical methodologies, implement standards of performance for existing and state-of-the-art new virologic assays, develop and test biostatistical methods relating to the assays, and acquire, test, store and dispense all quality control materials and reagents required for this program, including specimens collected from HIV-infected and -uninfected human subjects. The contractor will serve laboratories associated with current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups. Currently, the contract serves approximately 110 laboratories, 55 of which are international, located in 22 countries.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a one year base period of performance beginning on or about June 1, 2012. Options will be included to extend the term of the contract for an additional six years for a maximum period of performance of 7 years. The level of effort anticipated for support of the base period and six-one year options is 9.10 FTE/year.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 5 Labs. More than one (1), but not more than three (3), Options may be exercised in any one year. It is estimated that an additional 0.20 full time equivalents (FTEs) will be needed to accommodate these additional Labs during the first year of activation. If the options for these Labs are exercised for continuation in subsequent years, 0.10 FTE/year will be needed. Options to add new Labs will not be exercised in the last year of the contract (Year 7).</p>
<p>Addition of Expertise: Addition of a Quality Assessment Program for viral disease agents other than HIV and related co-pathogens. During the course of the contract it may be necessary to develop a quality assessment program for assays associated with viral disease agents other than HIV that were not anticipated at the time this solicitation was initiated, and that would directly support high priority NIAID research programs. During the contract period, one option could be activated for the addition of a Quality Assessment Program. The option may be activated in any year of the contract. Additional options to extend the Quality Assessment Program for subsequent years may be exercised as well. It is estimated that 3.10 full time equivalents (FTEs) will be needed for this Option in the first year, and in subsequent years if options are exercised for continuation.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC><p align="left"><strong>The design for each year is expected to be unique, although a standard structure may be used for all three years. The contractor is responsible for all aspects of this proposal, including the printing and delivery of the hardcopy PDFs to the NMB.<br /><br />During July of each year on a date mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the NMB, a Kick-off Meeting will be held to discuss Design themes and general specifications. Although the NMB prefers such meeting to be held at the NMB office in Washington, DC, other venues such online video conferencing will be considered. <br /><br />Since the electronic and hard-copy PDFs have earlier deadlines than the E-report; the NMB will expect the contractor to finalize the PDF version before moving its content to the E-report. The objective is to minimize the total number of edits that may be needed.</strong></p>
<p align="left">(A) PDF Electronic Version and Hard Copy</p>
<ul>
<li>100 Printed copies of the PDF are required with Digital Printing and Spiral Binding. The final PDF hard-copy publications are to be delivered to the NMB no later than 2:00 p.m. on November 14 of each year. Inside delivery to customer at suite 250 East is required.</li>
<li>The hard copy version of the PDF is expected to be around 100 pages, not to exceed 110, plus 4 pages for the covers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An electronic copy of the draft PDF must be made available on the Contractor's website for NMB access no later than October 17, 2011.</li>
<li>Drawing from the selected E-report design, develop one design for the PDF version of the Annual Report, using the current FY-2010 layout, which is available in the Documents section of the NMB website at www.nmb.gov.</li>
<li>Allow up to three (3) rounds of text edits during production phase. All three rounds to be accessible to the NMB online in color; and the third round also as hardcopy color lasers. Please note that there may be 2 rounds of color lasers if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>(8) E-report (HTML) version</p>
<ul>
<li>Once site architecture, pursuant to the Kickoff Meeting, is approved by the customer, present 3 design options showing the main page of the E-report with sample internal pages, using sample customer text and data from the 2010 E-report and PDF available via the NMB website (www.nmb.gov), each with distinct design concepts that range from Traditional to Contemporary to Futuristic. The internal pages should include text taken from the Mediation section of the current FY-2010 Annual Report and also a few supporting pages such as tables and lists.</li>
<li>Assume there will be 2 rounds of design edits of the E-report during the creative phase before implementation to the entire project.</li>
<li>The E-report files/images and Final-version of the electronic PDF must be provided to the Host of the NMB Website for posting no later than November 14, 2011.</li>
<li>The contractor will coordinate as necessary with the NMB website Host to insure proper implementation of the E-report.</li>
<li>Develop an outline the structure of the E-report for 2011 using a framework that can also be used for years 2012 and 2013 in order to minimize cost.</li>
<li>The design for each year is expected to be unique, although a standard structure may be used for all three years. Refine and create the single design direction selected by the NMB.</li>
<li>Online E-report Design and HTML Code: Front half Narrative Section as HTML, and Back Half Supporting Lists and Tables as PDF. The E-report is to include a fully hyperlinked Table of Contents and other relevant hyperlinks.</li>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>The versions of provisions and clauses incorporated herein are those in effect as of Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50 dated 5/16/2011.</p>
<p>The Export-Import Bank of the United States intends a sole source award for aggregate international publications reporting from Internet Securities Inc., ISI Emerging Markets database. The award will be for a base year valued at approximately $41,000.00, plus four consecutive twelve month options. The applicable NAICS code is 511199-All Other Publishers, with a small business size standard of 500 employees. There are no set-asides identified for this procurement.<br /><br />The Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank of the United States' Research Library has a requirement to purchase news, financials, and premium reports on emerging markets from Internet Securities, Inc., which pulls company and industry data from more than 80 emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Internet Securities' ISI Emerging Markets database (ISI) provides: Analyst reports on select industries by Investment Banks, BNE business new Europe, BuddeComm Telecom Market Overview &amp; Analysis reports, CIMB Industry Reports: Mining, Metin Demirsar Monthly Updates, and Steel Trade Intelligence, to name a few of the premium report titles essential to Ex-Im Bank staff. Internet Securities' ISI Emerging Markets database provides crucial financial data without which the Bank would not be able to make critical financial decisions in its dealings with sovereigns, banks, and companies.</p>
<p>Internet Securities' ISI Emerging Markets database is the only source for this specific mix of news, financials, and premium reports on emerging markets. ISI is the only aggregator that offers content directly from overseas publishers. No other subscription provides the level of financial reporting in emerging market countries that Ex-Im Bank requires.</p>
<p>This solicitation incorporates the FAR clauses 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jun 2008); 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009)); 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Mar 2009)); 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Dec 2009)); 52.217-8 (Option to Extend the Services (Nov 1999)); 52.217-9 (Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2009)); and 52.237-3 (Continuity of Services (Jan 1991)) for commercial items and services.</p>
<p>Supplemental Information to Clause 52.212-2: Paragraph (a) evaluation factors are:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide emerging markets research from sources that are domestic to each overseas market, not that are published in the US or recognized Global publishers.<br />&bull; Provide premium reports from sources such as BuddeComm, Enerdata, EnergyAsiaMedi-Stat , Metin Demirsar , and Steel Trade Intelligence. <br />&bull; Provide financial data for private emerging market companies. <br />&bull; Within the databases, provides automated translation of non-English documents.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>INQUIRIES CONCERNING THIS INTENT TO PROCURE SERVICES ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO MS. LORITA JACKSON AT <a href="mailto:lorita.jackson@exim.gov">lorita.jackson@exim.gov</a>.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.<br /><br />1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing. <br /><br />1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals. <br /><br />1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP). <br /><br /><strong>1.10 Identify in your proposal any particular security restrictions, deliverables, or any other URHD requirements in the SOW or other associated attachments that would restrict implementation of the Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop here in NGA.<br /></strong><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 1 to RFQ for NMR Spectrometer Console
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to supply potential offerors with measurement data on the NMR magnet and answer questions received to date.</p>
<p>Magnet Data</p>
<p>1. Magnet manufacturer: Oxford <br />2. Magnet serial #: 62440 <br />3. Dewar/Cryostat #: 93894 <br />4. Project/Job #: DLN0495/30/1 <br />5. Magnet age: ~ 20 years<br />6. Magnet 1H frequency: 300 MHz<br />7. Room temp bore diameter: 54 mm<br />8. Helium transfer tube length: 1676 mm<br />9. Ceiling height: 3658 mm<br />10. Centerline to bottom flange: 320 mm<br />11. Floor to bottom flange: 662.5 mm<br />12. Stand height: 662.5 mm<br />13. Top flange to bottom flange: 725.5 mm<br />14. Top flange to top of He fill port: 529 mm</p>
<p>The magnet has a safety drop-off plate, flat bottom plate and anti-vibration system.</p>
<p><br />Questions and answers:</p>
<p>1. What is the expected resistance and inductance of the gradient coils? We do not have gradient coils currently, so we are unable to answer this question at this time.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***<br />***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-47.***<br />*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted, and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***<br /><br /><br />PURPOSE:<br /><br />The Magnetics Group requires a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance--(NMR) system upgrade. Currently, we use an antiquated hybrid (Bruker-Tecmag) NMR spectrometer console which is fundamentally limited by the electronics available at the time of its manufacture. A modern spectrometer would allow us to continue using our current NMR superconducting magnet, room temperature shims and probe, while simultaneously expanding our capabilities to include the use of magnetic field gradients for the purpose of diffusion measurements and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (specifically MRI microimaging). In addition, the improved electronics of a new spectrometer will better enable us to use our cryogen-free magnet for NMR and MRI, as well as opening up a range of NMR and MRI techniques currently unavailable due to the limitations of the current spectrometer. These capabilities are in line with the goals of the BioMagnetic Imaging Program within the Magnetics Group, which is actively working on diffusion phantoms for quantitative MRI standards, as well as complimenting efforts in NMR/MRI microcoil design. Because of our interest in quantitative measurements at clinical MRI field strengths (1.5, 3, and 7 tesla), it is important that a new console being able to function at these field strengths.</p>

<DESC>***Attention Contractors*** <br />On 19 May, the RFQ was amended.&nbsp; The "Basis for Award" paragraph was edited.&nbsp; All other terms and conditions are unchanged.<br />********<br /><br />This is a Small Business Set-side
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located onboard the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD intends to purchase security services. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

It is the responsibility of all interested offerors to monitor the solicitation for any possible amendments and changes. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50, effective 06 May 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being set-aside for small businesses only. The solicitation number is HU0001-11-Q-1427. The applicable NAICS code is 561621-Security System Services, and the size standard is $12.5 million in annual receipts.</p>

<p>2. Description of Work</p>
<p>The adjustment and repair of the surveillance system includes all computer equipment, software updates, locks (readers), crash bars, and video equipment (monitors, VCR, cameras). Provide the manufacturer's required adjustments and all other work necessary.</p>
<p>3. Maintenance Support</p>
<p>a. The Contractor must provide maintenance support for the equipment listed under Heading 10, Security System Composition.</p>
<p>b. The Government requires the Contractor to provide the following specific levels of maintenance support:</p>
<p>b.1 Remote Support - this support will assist on-site Government personnel to verify the nature of a system problem prior to initiating a request for on-site maintenance support. This support is to be available on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis. Remote diagnostic capability must be provided in order to perform minor troubleshooting and/or software repairs.</p>
<p>b.2 Remedial Maintenance - includes maintenance, which is performed by the Contractor on-site, as required. This support is to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Remedial maintenance shall be treated as emergency maintenance to be performed. Response shall be within two (2) hours, as provided under Heading 5, Response Time. It shall be performed as required on an unscheduled basis.</p>
<p>b.3 Preventive Maintenance (PM) - shall include all preventive maintenance as required on the listed equipment under 10, Security System Composition. Contractor should provide at least two (2) preventive maintenance calls during the year. PMs shall be scheduled by mutual consent between the Contractor and the Government, and shall not interfere with normal Government operations.</p>
<p>4. Technical Support</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the quality of all services rendered hereunder must conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade or field of endeavor. All services must be rendered by or supervised directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade or field, and holding any licenses required by law.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide the Government with the telephone number of a primary point of contact for all on-call service/technical support.</p>
<p>Fully trained and competent maintenance personnel in accordance with the contract and the statement of work will provide maintenance coverage. "Fully trained" is defined as capable of performing required maintenance without trial and error, or in effect, without learning on the job at the expense of this contract. Personnel who are "in training" will not be utilized except as observers and helpers to qualified personnel. If during the performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer questions the adequacy of the qualifications of personnel assigned to this contract, the Contractor will have the burden of proving the personnel meet requirements.</p>
<p>During the scheduled visit the tech will provide preventive maintenance checks of all the security equipment to verify that all systems are working properly and document findings. As needed, the tech will make repairs/adjustments to malfunctioning equipment found during these checks and document this work.

If an on-site response is required, the Contractor must respond within four (4) hours. Within this response time interval, the Contractor may initially (so as to reduce system downtime) telephonically respond directly to on-site government personnel with appropriate instructions, which may return the system to full operation.</p>
<p>6. Upgrades</p>
<p>The Contractor must support all software components and functional features of these items. This support must include troubleshooting and problem solution of current software products.

<DESC>Statement of Work <br />Economic Impact Analysis on Proposed Regulations for Living Conditions for Organic Poultry<br />Agricultural Marketing Service<br />U.S. Department of Agriculture
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) regulations at 7 CFR Part 205 sets forth the national standards for production and handling of organic agricultural products. The NOP requires an economic analysis related to organic poultry production for the development of rule making, policies, guidance and statutory amendments. The NOP regulations were first published in 2000 and were updated in February 2010 to include a substantial practice standard amendment regarding access to pasture for livestock. The following sections regulate livestock living conditions as they apply to poultry: &sect; 205.238 (Livestock health care practice standard), &sect; 205.239 (Livestock living conditions).</p>
<p>The NOP regulations do not set specific stocking rates for either inside housing or the outside access areas, and it is clear that further elaboration is needed to ensure consistent regulatory implementation and enforcement. The NOP issued a general policy memo in October 2002 that affirmed that outside access areas are required, but it did not specify size or other details. The NOP subsequently provided a memo regarding exemption to outside access for purposed of biosecurity, as well as a decision that outside access could be provided in a fenced, roofed, and floored outside area (a "porch" attached to a poultry house). To obtain organic certification, poultry producers must submit an Organic System Plan (OSP) describing outside access to NOP. The OSP is subsequently reviewed by USDA-accredited certification agents, who then interpret the regulations, review the OSP for sufficiency, and conduct on-site inspections to verify compliance by organic operations. The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), the NOP's citizen advisory panel, made recommendations in April 2002, November 2009. The NOSB also proposed further changes in April 2011 concerning appropriate living conditions for poultry. The NOP intends to publish a regulatory amendment to 205.239 in accordance with NOSB final recommendations that will clarify requirements for outside access and indoor and outdoor stocking densities.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES<br />The NOP requires professional consulting services for an independent economic impact analysis on proposed rules for the living conditions for organic poultry. The NOP will provide a draft outline of proposed regulation changes, highlighting areas of change from the present rule. This draft will be provided to the contractor by July 1. This draft may also include more than one option for regulatory text. <br />The contractor will provide a sound analysis, including a justification of its methodology. The analysis will estimate the cost and benefits of implementing the proposed rule, in comparison to alternatives (as per Exec. Order 12866). Alternatives will include (1) no change to existing rule, or (2) other options to be developed by NOP. All work will comply with the USDA Information Quality Activities Regulatory Guidelines. Final deliverable must be in the format for publication in the Federal Register. <br />3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide professional consulting services necessary to develop an economic impact analysis for purposes of proposed rule publication regarding amendment to the requirements for poultry living conditions at 7 CFR 205.239. The contractor shall employ a proven methodology, based on past experience. The contractor shall gather input from relevant parties, such as agricultural economists, animal scientists, and biostatisticians, as well as individuals with first-hand knowledge of organic poultry production. This information will be used to analyze the predicted economic impact of the proposed rule. The status of baseline data on the organic poultry industry is unknown. The contractor should have the expertise to develop assumptions and economic models of potential impacts of the rule, if needed. Available data on organic production is limited; therefore, the contractor will be responsible for determining appropriate sources and methodology.</p>
<p>4. TASKS AND DELIVERABLES <br />This project will have three phases. Although the contractor may recommend additional steps or sub-tasks in its proposal, the proposal must demonstrate an ability to complete the following tasks:<br />Phase I<br />Evaluate and document a baseline scope of the industry. The contractor shall conduct data gathering on the following items, as well as any other topics deemed relevant to the regulations: <br />a) The volume and dollar value of current production of organic poultry products (eggs, broiler chickens, turkeys, other species);<br />b) The number of organic poultry operations (including a breakout of pullet and laying operations); <br />c) Range of scale of production (including a breakout of housing types by scale of production (e.g. aviary, or those enclosed structures currently providing outdoor access) <br />d) The geographic areas of production/distribution; <br />e) Marketing methods used for the product; <br />f) Cost of production, including infrastructure investments; <br />g) Trends in sales data over time; <br />h) information/data gaps; and <br />i) The confidence level of the estimates produced from the data. <br />Phase II<br />Establish an analysis of the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities and evaluate whether alternative proposals can accomplish same effects without unduly burdening small entities.<br />Phase III<br />Prepare the economic analysis for inclusion in proposed regulations.<br />5. DELIVERABLES<br />Phase I: baseline report defining the economic landscape that the rulemaking will affect. Due August 1st, 2011. <br />Phase II: paper outlining an analysis of the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities, and evaluate whether alternative proposals can accomplish same effects without unduly burdening small entities or erecting barriers that would restrict their ability to compete in the market, as per the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Due September 6th, 2011. <br />Phase III: written analysis for the inclusion in proposed rules, formatted for publication in the Federal Register. Due October 3rd, 2011. <br />Deliverable Review<br />NOP shall have 15 working days to review each draft and final deliverable. NOP shall have the right to reject or require the correction of any deficiencies found in the deliverables. In the event of rejection of any deliverables, the contractor shall be notified in writing and shall have 15 working days to correct the deficiencies at no additional cost to NOP. NOP shall have 15 working days to review corrections of any rejected deliverables. NOP will notify the contractor in writing that the required documents are sufficient to meet the above SOW requirements. Approvals of deliverables shall not be considered valid until the deliverables are approved in writing by NOP. In order to avoid problems with expectations of products, the contractor is encouraged to submit a draft document to NOP at 7 business days prior to final delivery to ensure acceptance criteria of products are met.<br />The Contractor shall formally respond to all written review comments from NOP within 5 business days of receipt or sooner. This response should indicate agreement/disagreement, and how the concern will be addressed within the next submission or resubmission. The final deliverable shall also include a traceability matrix indicating final disposition of all written review comments received.<br />All work products will become the intellectual property of USDA. The contractor may retain copies of scheduled reports and any deliverables that are available to the public. The contractor may not retain copies of any other deliverable.<br />Performance Monitoring<br />Performance will be monitored using the following methods:</p>
<p>&bull; In Process Review: The contractor shall be prepared to present periodic costs and performance information while in process. The focus shall be on identifying costs and schedule variances in completion of tasks. <br />&bull; Monthly Status Reports: The contractor shall provide a monthly status report via email for the project(s) within 5 days of the end of the month to the Federal Project Manager.</p>
<p>The following information is required for each monthly status report:</p>
<p>a) Hours and dollars billed per project, to include balance per project; <br />b) Summary of costs for each cost element (labor, travel, subcontracts, consultants, other direct costs, indirect costs) incurred during the period. <br />c) Activities achieved during the period based on agreed upon categories; <br />d) Status of deliverables during that period; <br />e) Estimate to complete all work remaining on the project, and projected monthly expenditures by project area to the completion date; and <br />f) Any other issues that need attention.</p>
<p>6. REQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE<br />The contractor should have educational background in economic analysis, and be able to conduct research in current literature regarding economic status and trends of the organic marketplace. The ability to create new baseline data or to make assumptions using current economic models is necessary. The contractor should be able to demonstrate prior knowledge of the Organic Foods Production Act (enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill) and USDA organic regulations (7 CFR part 205). The contractor should be familiar with the regulatory drafting process, including compliance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</p>
<p>7. PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance is Date of Award - September 1, 2011. The agreement may be extended for up to 3 months beyond the end of the period of performance, dependent upon satisfactory performance and due to unforeseen delays in project completions, and/or substantial changes in the specifications.</p>
<p>The contractor may perform the work anywhere in the United States, but must be accessible by electronic mail and telephone. The NOP will provide workspace when travel to Washington DC from another location is necessary for this assignment. The government will provide all documentation related to the study and access to AMS resources/staff. Workspace in the NOP office will be provided as needed for meetings or occasional visits. No other equipment will be provided.</p>
<p>8. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />The proposals will be evaluated on the likelihood of meeting the NOP's objectives.

The IRMS must relate investment risk to corresponding investment returns and report risk-adjusted investment performance and various statistical measures commonly used to characterize such performance. It must also have look-through capability to determine and report total exposure to a security, group of securities, industry, country, currency, or other common factor, and properly account for fixed income, public equities, and private market assets.</p>

For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The resultant contract from solicitation is anticipated to be of a single award, Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/Labor Hour (LH) hybrid type contract. The contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15.</p>

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation No. Q1450110014Amendment 0002May 16, 2011
Project Title: Sandblast and Recoat Interior of Tender Water Tank, Golden Spike National Historic Site
Description of Changes: This Amendment serves to provide comments to questions received in response to this solicitation.

Question 1:  As the specification requires that we use the air horns provided by others, can you please provide manufacturer, model number and any other pertinent data on the air horns?  If there is an OEM name plate on the horns it should provide all of the relevant data.Response 1:  Coppus - Jectair - Model# 3-HP Question 2:  If from a safety perspective we determine that some additional measures will be required for safe entry to the vessel during the project then I assume there would be no issue provided we include the description in our proposal.  For instance, we have executed projects in the past that we have required any person making entry to the work area to wear forced air hoods, cartridge (particulate or vapor) respirators, etc.  If this is the case for this project (which I expect it will be due to the lacquer thinner), then any third party inspectors or government employees would also be expected to comply with our safety plan.  Do you anticipate that this would be an issue?Response 2:  If the vendor determines additional measures are needed for safe entry of the tank, then please include that in the proposal.  The government inspector(s) will comply with the contractors safety plan.
Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment and all other amendments prior to the hour and date specified in the solicitation or as amended by one of the following methods:
   1) Signing and dating this amendment and returning with offer;   2) By acknowledging receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted; or   3) By separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the solicitation and amendment numbers.
FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OFFERS PRIOR TO THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.
If by virtue of the amendment you desire to change an offer already submitted, such change may be made by telegram or letter, provided each telegram or letter makes reference to the solicitation and this amendment, and is received prior to the opening hour and date specified.
Third Party: If you have given a copy of this Solicitation to someone else, please forward this amendment accordingly.

This procurement is sole source to Versalogic Corp.
 as the above parts have previously been tested and found acceptable for the system for which they will be used.  Substitution of any other brand or parts will cause compatibility issues and render NSWC PCD unable to provide the required support to the system.  The NAICS Code for this effort is 334111, the FSC Code is 7035, and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  Questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Stacy Figlinski, at stacy.figlinski@navy.mil.

Each Offeror must bring their government issued picture I.D. Offerors are responsible for their own transportation to and from the buildings. Parking accommodations are located in designated visitor areas around the Denver Federal Center. No questions will be entertained during the tour. All questions will be in writing, and received by the Contract Specialist, Susan M. Protho via e-mail at susan.protho @gsa.gov no later than, Monday April 18, 2011. Questions in writing will also be entertained, if presented at the beginning of the conference. Offerors may not be able to re-enter buildings after the tour. Thus, all Offerors are cautioned to see all areas as they deem necessary during the tour, in order to augment their ability to submit an informed proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the conference is to provide a briefing of the contracting concept, the statement of work, the specifications, and to allow prospective Offerors the opportunity to ascertain the complexities and the location of the project to be performed along with the general and local conditions which could materially affect conduct of operations and the costs involved. The Government considers attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive offer. It will enable the Contractor to become acquainted with the work areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is emphasized that it is more advantageous for each Offeror to have qualified representation at the pre-proposal conference. While the conference will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify the solicitation provisions, nothing said or represented in the conference will be deemed to modify the solicitation requirements unless followed by a written amendment.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract. A CPFF is determined to be the appropriate instrument for this procurement since it is difficult to define a scope of work to the degree of specificity needed for a fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR 16.301-2.  Given the technical complexity of the program, the anticipated need for substantial involvement during program implementation and the anticipated total estimated costs, the CO determined that the Government's needs could best be met through a full and open competition for a CPFF completion type contract.<br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to achieve broad base agricultural growth in targeted areas of the DRC through three key component areas of intervention namely: 1) increased agricultural productivity; 2) improving market efficiency; and 3) developing the capacity to respond to market opportunities. Interventions will include support to farmer organizations to improve productivity and market access of small-scale, particularly women, producers, interventions to make markets more efficient, and support to improve the capacity for smallholders and agri-businesses to respond to market opportunities.<br /><br />Place of Performance: The Democratic Republic of the Congo

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1,  VA Medical Center, 940 Belmont Street (90C), Brockton, MA 02301.  Regarding transaction 523-11-3-7910-1808.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of surgical custom packs needed for direct patient care for the surgical department at VA Boston. Cardinal Health has a current FSS contract, but these are custom surgical kits required for surgery and are considered an open market procurement.  RFQ VA-241-11-RQ-0431 is currently open and was posted to FBO, as an SDVOSB set-aside on March 30, 2011.  It is currently still being reviewed for contract award, estimated for Oct 1, 2011 start date. Surgical has an immediate need to receive these sterilized surgical kits for scheduled surgeries from May 20, 2011 through September 30, 2011.  The estimates are provided based on past history per the schedule, but cannot be 100% foreseen in the near future. Surgical is requesting an immediate purchase order for the immediate needs of the VA patients while the current RFQ is being finalized for contract award.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Period of Performance May 20, 2011 through September 30, 2011 to obtain the following surgical custom packs for the VA Boston Surgical Department:

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	( X )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

a.  Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) -  Cardinal Health, 120 Raritan Center, Edison, NJ 08818 has been supplying these surgical custom kits (as attached in Attachment A&B) for the past ten years for surgical needs of VA patients.  This is a follow-on purchase order for the immediate surgical need, so patient care is not interrupted, as the RFQ has been posted to FBO on March 30, 2011 and is still being reviewed for a contract award estimated for October 1, 2011.  The surgical department does not have the personnel or the space to sterilize each one of these surgical custom packs required for scheduled patient surgeries.  

b.  Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2, 6.303-2(a)(9)(ii)) - The surgical department has run out of the sterilized custom packs, as required under item 3.  There are VA patients that have scheduled surgeries, that would be in critical need if these sterilized supplies were not sent immediately.  There cannot be a lapse in supply, while a new contract is being negotiated.  The surgical packs, as listed in item 3 are based on actual scheduled surgeries and estimated surgeries from May 20, 2011 through September 30, 2011. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  RFQ VA-241-11-RQ-0431 is currently open and was posted to FBO, as an SDVOSB set-aside on March 30, 2011.  It is currently still being reviewed for contract award, estimated for Oct 1, 2011 start date. Surgical has an immediate need to receive these sterilized surgical kits for scheduled surgeries from May 20, 2011 through September 30, 2011.  There was a positive response to this RFQ and the responses are currently under contracting review.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The pricing is considered fair and reasonable due to the past pricing history, per FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Refer to Section VI above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Refer to Section VI above.
12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
	REDACTED VERSION

13.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 


a.	Contracting Officer's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
