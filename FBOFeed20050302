<DESC>CLIN 0001: 5706 Compact Range Probing Service
This requirement is for the procurement of technical services necessary for establishing the efficacy of the electromagnetic field of the Compact Range within the volume surrounding the Antenna Under Test (AUT), known as the “quiet zone”.  The services must be provided for both C-Band fields, as well as Ku-Band fields, since the Range must support both frequency bands.  The field characteristics desired are well known, but require special tooling and data reduction techniques to enable the measurements to be made with the necessary accuracy and the raw data reduced for comparison to the industry accepted values for a “quiet zone”.  Additionally, the contractor must present these results to our technical staff in a format easily evaluated by those trained in electromagnetics.
Microwave Instrument Technologies (MIT) is the successor Corporation to the pioneering entity in the commercial application of the so-called Compact Range.  As such, they are the inheritors of all intellectual property previously owned by Scientific Atlanta related to antenna measurement technology. The Compact Range and all its components were designed, manufactured and have been maintained by MIT, or its predecessor, since the range was purchased by the U. S. Government, approximately 15 years ago.  Given the historical perspective, the supplier’s familiarity and expertise in the technology involved and the unique proprietary probe design available only to them; these are some of the unique set of mandatory capabilities that resides only with MIT.  In particular, MIT possesses proprietary information related to this particular installation based on the extensive maintenance history they have accumulated over the past 15 years that would be relevant in interpreting the probe data.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading the national effort to revise the 1996 Guidelines for the Death Scene Investigation of Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death and the Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death Investigation Report Form (SUIDIRF).  The SUIDIRF is used nationally by states, counties, and local jurisdictions on a voluntary basis to gather information about the circumstances surrounding sudden, unexplained infant deaths (SUIDS).  The SUIDIRF is important because it provides a standardized system for the death scene investigation of SUIDS.  Lack of such a standardization results in inaccurate diagnosis and reporting of the cause of death, and thus hinders our ability to monitor trends in SUIDS, conduct meaningful research, and monitor programs aimed at preventing SUIDS.  To improve the diagnosis and reporting of SUIDS in the US, all death scene investigators need to have access to and familiarity with the form, as well as training on how to conduct a SUIDS death scene investigation.  Therefore, the CDC, Maternal and Infant Health Branch (MIHB) is seeking to obtain the services from an experienced contractor to train coroners, medical examiners and all those involved with infant death scene investigations to conduct an infant death scene investigation using the revised SUIDIRF and related training materials.
There is a base period of performance approximately 8 months and two option periods of 12 months each. CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to BBiltz@cdc.gov. The tentative issue date is March 16, 2005, with the RFP issue date approximately 30 days after posting of the RFP. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. The associated NAICS codes are 541710 or and the small business size standard is $6 million. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.  See numbered note 1.

B. Full text of announcement
I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

The Information Processing Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting proposals for a two-phase program. The Learning Locomotion program will develop and demonstrate new algorithms that learn how to locomote based on the experience of a legged platform confronting extreme terrain.  

Before submitting proposals, Offerors must refer to the Learning Locomotion Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm. The PIP contains additional details regarding the Program Objectives, Program Description, Locomotion Platform, Terrain Boards, Test and Evaluation, Program Scope, Submission Process, Reporting Requirements and Procedures, Proposal Format, Evaluation and Funding Processes.

PROGRAM GOAL:  The goal of the Learning Locomotion program is to develop a new generation of learning algorithms that enable traversal of large, irregular obstacles by unmanned vehicles.  Large, irregular obstacles such as urban rubble, rock fields, and fallen logs present minor challenges to dismounted forces, slowing but not stopping them.  For today’s small unmanned vehicles, these same obstacles create No-Go areas, limiting effectiveness on the battlefield.  Enabling future unmanned vehicles to traverse large, irregular obstacles will allow robots to better contribute to military operations by United States and coalition forces.  It is expected that the performance of the algorithms developed will far exceed the performance of handcrafted systems, creating a breakthrough in locomotion over extreme terrain.  Further, it is expected that the algorithms developed will be broadly applicable to the class of “agile” ground vehicles.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  Phase I is a 15-month effort to develop learning methods that control autonomous travel over extreme terrain. Performer teams will receive two items as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  The first is a locomotion platform called Little Dog, with 4 legs, 3 actuators per leg, and a total weight less than 7 pounds.  The second is a board with terrain features built onto it, with obstacles of varying size and spacing.  On an approximately monthly basis beginning approximately three months into the period of performance, performer teams will upload their software to a central facility.  There, a staff of independent DARPA-designated operators will download the code into a functionally identical Little Dog, and run it on a terrain board that is statistically equivalent but not physically identical to the GFE terrain boards.  The criteria for Phase I are for the learned system to travel one-tenth of a leg length per second and surmount an obstacle with the height of four-tenths of a leg length.  Phase II is an 18-month effort to continue development of learning methods and begin to refine them.  The criteria for Phase II are for the learned system to travel six-tenths of a leg length per second, and surmount an obstacle with the height of nine-tenths of a leg length.  Offerors are directed to Section 2, Program Description, of the PIP for further information. 

FUNDING:  The Government anticipates multiple awards of approximately $600K-$800K per Phase. Continued funding into Phase II will be based on achieving the Phase I performance criteria. There will be an opportunity for offerors who are not selected for a contract award to participate in testing. These teams will be loaned a robot and terrain board and be allowed to participate in a reduced set of government experiments.

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

3. Human Use Instructions
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances.  These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.  
For proposals involving “greater than minimal risk” to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA.  For proposals that are forecasted to involve “greater than minimal risk” after the first year, a discussion on how and when the offeror will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement and the PIP contain all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [Note: see paragraph 6, “other submission requirements,” for reference to the PIP.]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
This BAA requires completion of an online Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  To do so, the offeror must go to http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-25  and follow the instructions there.  Each offeror is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If an offeror intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  
PROPOSAL FORMAT: Offerors must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-25, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) April 15, 2005, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 05-25, Learning Locomotion will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) March 1, 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through March 1, 2006. While the proposals submitted after the April 15, 2005, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, offerors should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.
4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Offerors must obtain the BAA 05-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-25 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information
1.  Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 
a)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims.  Evaluation will also consider the effectiveness of the system integration and management plan.
b)	Control Issues: Demonstrated understanding of the issues in controlling a high degree-of-freedom quadruped robot.
c)	Implement Machine Learning Methods: Demonstrated understanding of how to implement machine learning methods in real-world problems  
d)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.
e)	Cost Realism:  The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.
2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).

VI. Award Information Administration

1.  Award Notices

Principal Investigators will receive a letter informing them of the disposition of their proposal via U.S. mail.  

2.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Offerors may visit DARPA’s Contracts Management Office (CMO) website (http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/modelgrantagreement.htm) for model grant and cooperative agreement terms and conditions.

3.  Reporting
The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of  Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished URL on the World Wide Web (WWW).

<DESC>TITLE:  PRODUCTION OF GASTIPS PUBLICATION.  (NAICS 424920) DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Hart Energy Publishing, LP, Houston, TX for the GasTIPS quarterly technical journal in accordance with the statement of work listed below. STATEMENT OF WORK Three issues of GasTIPS will be produced during calendar year 2005 and distributed in or about the months of May, July, and September.  A fourth publication will be produced and distributed between December 2005 and February 2006.  The publicationâ€™s size, cover and layout will be substantially similar to the current GasTIPS publication, with such modifications as may be necessary to acknowledge the contributions and reflect the status of other joint sponsors. Each issue will be mailed to the then-current GasTIPS mailing list of approximately 9,500 names, with such additions and deletions due to new subscriptions and reader attrition as may occur during 2004.  Copies may be mailed to additional reader lists as may be deemed appropriate by the joint sponsors.  Each issue will be mailed to Western hemisphere subscribers free of charge, but subscribers for issues mailed to non-Western hemisphere locations may be charged. NETL will have the right to provide, on an alternating basis, either three (3) or four (4) technical articles per issue on topics concerning natural gas exploration, production, processing, or related topics.  These articles will be of a length comparable to past GasTIPS articles.  The publisher will provide writing and editing assistance to NETL authors as necessary, and NETL will provide information in a timely fashion.  Non-NETL content for each issue of GasTIPS will be provided by other joint sponsors and/or the publisher. NETL submissions will be subject to a final review by NETL before printing.  An editorial calendar and submission schedule will be determined by mutual agreement of the joint sponsors. The Editorsâ€™ Commentary column in each issue will be developed jointly by the publisher and the joint sponsors.  The joint sponsors will approve the column text before publication. The publisher will supply to NETL, in PDF format, all articles that appear in each issue, for publication on the NETL website, on or shortly after the publication date of each issue. If NETL desires, the publisher will tip in one 4-page (or less) insert into any issue, providing that NETL supplies the insert to the publisherâ€™s printer in a timely fashion prior to the mailing date.  The publisher may permit other joint sponsors to provide inserts and/or use the mailing list in ways deemed appropriate by the joint sponsors. The publisher will provide to NETL an additional 500 copies of each issue, shipped to a single domestic U.S. location specified by NETL. (This will be the NETL library in Morgantown, WV, unless otherwise directed by NETL.) NETL can obtain additional copies at cost if sufficient notice is given prior to printing. In return for the services described above, NETL will remit to the publisher a fixed payment per issue.  The publisher will submit an invoice to NETL for payment following the publication of each issue. NETL is a trademark of the U.S. Department of Energy, and its use as well as the use of any other trademarked names within the GasTIPS publication will continue to be so noted. This purchase order is to be issued to the Hart Energy Publishing, LP because the vendor is uniquely qualified to conduct the project since it is the current publisher of GasTIPS and has an established subscriber list and an ongoing relationship with acknowledged leaders in the Gas Industry.  There is no other known source that can effectively disseminate the results and policy information to the Gas Technology Community.  The participation in this project is relevant to the DOE mission as key areas of gas exploration and production topics. This request is considered to be sole source to the Hart Energy Publishing LP. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award is set aside small business and shall be awarded using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Gary Sames, PHONE: 412-386-5067.  All bids, proposal, or quotations must be received by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, March 18, 2005.

The government intends to negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Time and Material (T&M) pricing provisions for engineering and analytical support services for the operational testing and evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft as required by the Commander, Naval Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).  This requirement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The solicitation and resulting contract will be for one base year and three additional one-year option periods.  The main testing squadron supported by this acquisition will be Air Test and Evaluation Squadron NINE (VX-9).  The scope of this acquisition includes engineering and technical support for all phases of OT&E.  OT&E may be divided up into early involvement, OT&E planning, OT&E execution, OT&E reporting, and in-service monitoring phases.  The OT&E phases may be generally described as follows:  
* Early Involvement: This is the earliest OT&E phase of a program, and typically begins more than one year prior to the first scheduled OT&E event.  Tasks and deliverables during this phase focus on planning and resourcing future OT&E, and coordination with DT&E (Developmental Test and Evaluation).
* OT&E Planning:  This includes preparation for an OT&E phase of a program that will typically occur within one year.  Tasks and deliverables during this phase center on detailed test planning and scheduling.  DT&E coordination continues.
* OT&E Execution:  This includes executing the actual OT&E.  Tasks during this phase focus on scheduling, coordination, briefing, participation in, and debriefing test events.  Deliverables focus on data collection and anomaly reporting.
* OT&E Reporting.  This phase of OT&E centers on drafting the OT&E report after completion of the testing.  This phase is time limited.  Tasks include data collection and analysis.  The draft final report deliverable is the contractor's prime focus during this phase.
* In-Service Monitoring.  This optional phase occurs after OT&E is completed, reported, and the tested system is fielded.  COMOPTEVFOR and VX-9 may determine a need exists to situate an analyst on-site with a fleet unit employing a system VX-9 recently completed testing on.  Tasks focus on monitoring the performance of the fielded system.  Deliverables include anomaly reports and drafts standard USN/USMC deficiency reports.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the Low Price Technically Acceptable offeror.  In order to be rated “Technically Acceptable” overall, the proposal must be rated “Technically Acceptable” in the evaluation factors Technical Capability and Past Performance.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: (1)	Technical Capability (2)	Past performance (3)	Price (1)  Technical Capability of the item(s) offered to meet the government requirement  To determine technical capability, the offeror shall submit two (2) sets of the following documents: (a)	Contractor-generated engineering drawings, calculations and specifications.  These documents shall: be based on the Navy-provided drawing and/or layout of storage bays and mezzanine, shall conform to the government requirements stated on page 1 of this synopsis/solicitation (items 0001 and 0002), shall reflect the contractor’s unique solution/approach to meeting the government requirements and, shall include a legend/certification that all structural engineering and calculations meet the requirements of the International Business Code 2000.

Failure to meet any one of (a) through (c) above, and non-approval by the Government will render the proposal “Technically Unacceptable”. Offerors that are rated “Technically Unacceptable” on Technical Capability will not be evaluated for Past Performance and will not be considered for contract award. (2) Past Performance Offeror's Past Performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for at least 3 of its most current and relevant contracts.  Current is defined as a contract (or subcontract) in-progress or a contract (or subcontract) completed within the last 3 years.  Relevant is defined as a contract that is current and also any Federal, State, or local government, or private contract that is of similar scope, magnitude and complexity to the requirements as described in this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Quotes which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. For each contract provided as a reference, the Offeror should provide the following information: CONTRACT INFORMATION Contract Number:             							 Date Completed: Contract Type:                Fixed Price 		 Cost Reimbursement                        Other (Specify) Item Description: Contract Quantity/Length of Service: Customer Name:                			Customer POC: (Person who can verify data) Address:                      Telephone:                              FAX: QUALITY NOTE:  An explanation must accompany all answers with an asterisk(*). Was consideration or a monetary withhold for non-conforming supplies/services or late deliveries assessed against this contract?     YES *  (Explanation)                             NO Was/is any part of this contract terminated for default and/or in litigation?                            YES *   (Explanation)                           NO         Was any warranty work completed on delivered items?                           YES *      (Explanation)                          NO Did you receive any quality awards in the past three years?                         YES *     (List Awards)                         NO TIMELINESS Were all items (including products, services, reports, etc.) delivered within the original contract schedule? YES       NO *       (Explanation) The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: (a) Neutral:  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available may receive a neutral rating for past performance. The evaluation of past performance will take in account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to review past performance information and if deficient in demonstrating an "acceptable" risk, rate the past performance either as "neutral" or "unacceptable."  The Offeror must provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  An Offeror failing to provide the past performance information or to assert that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance may be considered ineligible for award. (b) Acceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts met contractual requirements.  Such prior performance was accomplished with some problems for which corrective actions taken by, or proposed to be taken by, the Offeror, were, or are expected to be, effective.  Performance of prior contracts was consistently of adequate or better quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The Offeror’s past performance record leads to an expectation of adequate performance, with little risk anticipated with delivery of a quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Offeror's past performance. (c) Unacceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts did not meet most contractual requirements.  Such prior performance reflected serious problems for which the Offeror either failed to identify or implement corrective actions, or for which corrective actions were, or are expected to be, mostly ineffective.  Performance of completed contracts was consistently of poor quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The Offeror’s past performance record leads to a strong expectation that successful performance will not be achieved.  Significant potential risk is anticipated with delivery of a quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Offeror's past performance. (3) Price (a) Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Performance risk assessments may be conducted as appropriate in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d)(3).  The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of total aggregate price of all items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all items.  Quotes shall:   1) Show the proposed unit price and/or extended price.  In case of discrepancy between a unit price and an extended price, the unit price will be presumed to be correct.  (b) An offeror must propose a price on all items. Any quote failing to do so will not be considered for award   The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  Note: In evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (1) to be technically acceptable, Factor (2), PAST PERFORMANCE, is approximately equal to Factor (3), PRICE.  However, the degree of importance of price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals with regard to Past Performance.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to award a contract based on initial proposals and without discussions with offerors.  Each initial quote should, therefore, contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  The government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.   Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/. All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes may be e-mailed to laura.Maxwell@navy.mil or faxed to 619-532-5947 (ATTN:  Laura Maxwell).  Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement to continue specialized scientific and technical support to the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and the Sounder Research Team in the Laboratory for Atmospheres.  This support includes, but is not limited to, the following: 1) the development of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric model and an integrated land surface model to simulate the atmospheric general circulation, provide a component of the atmospheric analysis system to assimilate the Earth Observing System (EOS) data, and transport of chemical constituents in the troposphere, and stratosphere; 2) the development and testing of atmospheric data assimilation systems that advance the usefulness of satellite data and contribute to observing system development; 3) development of assimilation procedures to use satellite-based rainfall data to improve GMAO models and analyses; 4) generation of products in support of NASA instrument teams and climate research; 5) generation and analysis of products from the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder and retrievals from the Advanced Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on EOS/Aqua; and 6) development of systems for generation of surface wind analyses, and observing system impact studies.  NASA/GSFC intends to acquire additional services from SAIC Corporation from April 1, 2005 through November 31, 2005 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source using a Task Order.	This extension of service is required to complete a full and open competition. It is not practical or cost effective to complete a full and open competition for 7 months as a precursor to the award of a follow-on contract, which will be conducted under full and open competition.  To compete a contract for only 7 months introduces risks to the completion of critical milestones to support GMAO.	The phase-in time and lead-time for new contractor personnel to become minimally experienced and functional to meet the government requirements will result in unacceptable delays in GMAO milestone schedules.   It is not practical to conduct two competitions for the same requirement in one year due to the cost of the competition and risks to program objectives. The cost increase will allow GMAO to complete the following critical milestones:  1) completion and full validation of GEOS-5, an improved atmospheric assimilation system that will be used for a NASA deliverable to the President's Climate Change Science Program beginning in January 2006; 2) provision of meteorology and atmospheric constituent products in support of an Aura validation campaign in July 2005; 3) continued analysis product of the historical data stream as a deliverable to the CERES project and other climate analysis projects at NASA/Langley Research Center, with a delivery milestone in September 2005;  4) continued real-time and near-real time meteorology products in support of Aura instrument team retrievals and MODIS land products; 5) commitments to NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction through the NOAA/NASA/DoD Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation in the continued development of the atmospheric data assimilation system and the advance of AIRS and MODIS satellite data assimilation.  The support to be provided by SAIC under this extension is a continuation of work provided for more than 10 years.  SAIC possesses unique and specialized experience critical to the successful completion of the above milestones.	 The experience of the team is essential in the identification of and recovery from operational system failures and in the quality assurance of products delivered to the end users. SAIC also provides the technical expertise to integrate the highly specialized model and analysis software into an operational system needed to analyze the system performance in a validation framework.	SAIC also has the highly specialized scientific background needed to identify science issues that need to be addressed in system tuning. The operational software scripts and systems, the quality assurance software and the validation software suite have been developed and tested by SAIC staff, all with specialized science or software engineering backgrounds.  SAIC is the only company with the capability of providing the technical support without a reduction in service.  Any other contractor would be required to (1) train people in the operational procedures established for the generation of these specialized products; (2) learn the GMAO atmospheric and land surface models and atmospheric analysis systems (containing hundreds of thousands lines of code) to a sufficient technical level to be able to make modifications to the code as a result of tuning and/or validation runs; and (3) hire an adequate number of staff from the limited pool of specialized scientists who have experience in the development and evaluation of models and assimilation systems and in the use of satellite data streams to meet all the milestones listed above. The Government does not intend to acquire  commercial items using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 17, 2005.

Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation.

TITLE:     Network Attack Traceback

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:     Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-04-IFKA

CFDA Number:  12.800 

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 5 Apr 05; FY 06 by 1 Mar 06; FY 07 by 1 Mar 07; and FY08 by 15 Oct 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2 p.m. Eastern time on 1 Mar 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.
I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:
DESCRIPTION:  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/IF, in conjunction with the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase our knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Network Attack Traceback, to include beta testing of prototype capabilities.  Solutions to basic and applied  research and engineering traceback problems using innovative approaches are sought.   This includes high-risk, high-payoff capabilities for non-cooperative and/or hostile network environments. The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques that provide capabilities which will increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack, ideally to the originating host, using solely technical means. We are particularly interested in tracing attacks that would compromise the confidentiality and integrity of information on Intelligence Community (IC) networks.  These IC networks include the NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS, and IC enclaves.  Techniques designed for tracing Denial-of-Service attacks in IC networks are NOT the focus of this BAA, nor are techniques that involve probabalistic packet marking. ARDA is especially interested in traceback techniques for attacks launched with single packets involving encrypted payloads, chaff and other obfuscation techniques. 
Research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities ideally addressing both the collection and analysis aspects of the traceback problem.  However, projects specializing in highly novel and interesting techniques for just collection or just analysis will also be considered, if deemed to be of "breakthrough" quality and importance.  The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities.  Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use, particularly within the IC, are of high interest. 
Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work efficiently. 
Offerors are encouraged to submit classified white papers via the appropriate channels.  Contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII.  
SCOPE:  The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques to increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack. The areas of interest include the broad range of tools and techniques to traceback the network attack to the originating Local Area Network, the attacker’s Internet Service Provider, or an originating Autonomous System with the goal of identifying the specific host which launched the attack. Deliverables will be technical reports, software, demonstrations, and results of experiments which provide evidence and metrics concerning the assertions/claims about the research. Demonstrations may involve exploratory development models (ie brassboards) if appropriate.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $10M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $400K; FY 06 - $3.6M. Additional funding of $3M each in FY07 and FY08 is also being pursued.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 18 months, and have a total value in the range of $400,000 to $1,000,000.     The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $10 million.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts only.

This acquisition is for the privatization of the electric, gas, water and wastewater distribution systems at Pine Bluff Arsenal, AR.  Privatization is the complete divestiture and transfer of ownership of a U.S. Government-owned utility system to a non-Government entity.  In conjunction with the purchase of the systems, the contractor will also be required to provide (as needed) improvements, upgrades; repairs; expansions; investments; and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  The following guidance has established the necessary requirements to accomplish Utility Privatization (UP):  10 U.S.C. 2688 (1997) and OSD UP Guidance (09 Oct 02).  

Installation Description

Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA), located in Southeast Arkansas, is 35 miles southeast of Little Rock and eight miles northwest of the city of Pine Bluff.  It is bordered on the east by the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System and on the west by the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Highway 65, making it directly accessible by rail, road or waterway.  The city of Pine Bluff boasts one of the busiest ports on the Arkansas River and serves as a transportation hub for the regional railroads.  PBA is located in Jefferson County, 35 miles south of the Little Rock National Airport and 40 miles from Little Rock Air Force Base.  The 15,000-acre (approximate) installation is under the command jurisdiction of the Commanding General, U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM).

Construction of Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA) began during the World War II era. Since then, it has been an active military facility. Today, as a part of the U.S. Army Materiel Command, it has housing areas, headquarters and administrative areas, numerous production facilities, testing facilities, ammunition storage and loading areas.
Pine Bluff’s mission is to provide support to the Department of Defense in the production and storage, and demilitarization of chemical munitions.  The PBA vision is to become a world-class facility for the production of smoke/pyrotechnic munitions and chemical/biological defense items; and the developmental support center for emerging technology in these areas.
The Arsenal’s population is composed of approximately 1,000 military and civilian employees. The civilian work force is an ever-changing number, dependant upon the production schedule assigned to PBA. Civilian employees comprise approximately 90 percent of the total PBA population.
The following system descriptions provide potential offerors with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the utility systems. 
Electrical Distribution System Description

The PBA electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system between the points of demarcation separating Government ownership of the distribution system from the electric supplier and separating the distribution system from end-users. The system may include, but is not limited to, circuit breakers, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, duct banks, switches, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment. 
The electrical distribution system at PBA includes:
•	approximately 102 miles of overhead primary circuits;
•	approximately 11 miles of underground primary circuits;
•	three distribution substations providing approx. 22.5 MVA;
•	approximately 14 miles of lighting circuits; and
•	approximately 26.4 MVA of transformer capacity.
Pine Bluff Arsenal currently purchases its electric power requirements from Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (Entergy), which feeds the PBA electrical distribution system at three locations. It provides two 115 kV feeders into the Main Substation (also referred to as Substation C) and one 13.2 kV feeder each to Substations A and B.
The majority of electrical distribution circuits at PBA are constructed on single wood pole structures with 8-foot cross arms and pin type insulators. 
Feeder sectionalizing switches are installed at selected locations in the distribution system to facilitate operational flexibility and maintenance safety. Capacitor banks and small line regulators are installed at several locations for voltage stabilization and power factor improvements.
Natural Gas Distribution System Description

The PBA natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system between the points of demarcation separating government ownership of the distribution system from the natural gas supplier and separating the distribution system from end-users. The system may include, but is not limited to, regulating stations, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. 
PBA purchases its natural gas service through the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) from Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) Energy Resources Company. The OG&E natural gas is delivered via a Reliant Energy natural gas pipeline to the Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company (ARKLA) city gate and is then delivered to the PBA natural gas distribution system. 
ARKLA supplies gas from a transmission system, which receives its gas from fields in east Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. An emergency connection to the Mississippi River Fuel Company’s transmission line is also maintained by ARKLA adjacent to the east boundary of PBA.
The PBA natural gas distribution system is made up of pipeline ranging from less than 1- to 10-inches in diameter, consisting of several material types (i.e., steel, coated and wrapped steel, cast iron, black iron, polyethylene plastic, and coated and wrapped black iron). Despite the vast material types, the majority of the 3-inch and larger pipes appear to be made up of coated and wrapped steel.  Total length of the gas distribution network is approximately 150,000 LF.
Potable Water Distribution System Description

The PBA potable water system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to pumping stations and distribution components. The system may include, but is not limited to pumps, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities/tanks (including obstruction lights), and backflow prevention devices (BPD)s. 
All water rights (pumping or purchased) will remain with the Government; no water will be transported off the installation.
Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization package:
•	Irrigation systems
•	Fire suppression systems
Until approximately 1989, there were two distinct water systems operated and maintained by PBA. A south system that provided potable water to the entire Installation was separate and distinct from a non-potable system that existed on the Installation’s north side. The non-potable system that provided fire protection to the Depot Area (Area 5) is now non-operational. The well that provided raw water to the now inoperable system is retained for future demilitarization use. A modernization project in the late 1980s improved the Area 5 distribution system to support the growing requirements on the Installation’s north side. This system is henceforth referred to as the North System.
The principle potable water source for PBA, as well as much of southeastern Arkansas, is the Sparta Sand Aquifer. Several wells supply the water used at PBA. These wells are typically 700 to 1,100 feet deep with pumps set at approximately 340 feet. The aquifer serving the wells is currently adequate; however, the aquifer level is receding and mandates that water pumped from PBA wells not be sold to customers off the installation.  
The Water Treatment Plant TP has a rated capacity of 2 million gallons per day (MGD); however, the effective capacity is reported at approximately 1.44 MGD. 
Storage capacity totals approximately 1.2 million gallons in six elevated storage tanks. 
The water distribution network system is made up of pipe ranging from less than 2 to 16 inches in diameter, consisting of several material types; most common types are cast iron and PVC.  Total length of the water distribution network is approximately 350,000 LF.
Wastewater System Description

The PBA wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system as defined by the points of demarcation beginning at the connection to the treatment provider and ending at each end use facility. The system may include, but is not limited to, gravity pipelines, force mains, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).  
Originally constructed in 1942, the PBA wastewater collection system is divided into two separate systems. Each system possesses its own wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The two systems are known locally as the Incendiary Bomb Filling System (south) and the Chemical Area System (north). A separate collection and treatment system exists in the manufacturing area for industrial waste. The industrial waste system is not included in this privatization effort. Several septic tanks are located in remote areas of the Installation and are used to treat domestic waste. These septic systems are also not included in this privatization effort.
A force main that discharges effluent from both WWTPs to the Arkansas River outfall was installed in 1994 and is permitted by the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (ADPC&E). 
Total length of the collection network is approximately 200,000 LF.
Southern Area
Within the south system, the wastewater is collected through a series of 4 to 24-inch gravity main lines.  There are 10 pumping stations within the south system. Two pumping stations pump wastewater directly into the WWTP while the remaining eight stations discharge wastewater to the gravity sewer system. The original sewer lines (installed in 1942) primarily utilize vitrified clay for the gravity mains and cast iron for the force mains. The depth of the sewer lines in the south system ranges from 5 to 12 feet. The total treatment capacity of the south system is 1.7 MGD. The average daily wastewater flow is approximately 0.3 MGD.
The south collection system utilizes 10 lift stations throughout the collection and treatment systems. 
Northern Area
The north collection system is similar to the south system in that it utilizes 4 to 24-inch gravity main lines. There are seven pumping stations moving the wastewater to the north system WWTP. The gravity mains in the north collection system are primarily vitrified clay while the force mains are primarily cast iron pipe with an average line depth of 7 to 7½ feet.  The total treatment capacity of the north system is 0.9 MGD.
The north collection system utilizes seven lift stations to move the wastewater to the north WWTP.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Indefinite Delivery Contract that will provide for the capability to issue a series of task orders not to exceed $750,000.00 in one calendar year.  At the option of the Government, this contract may be extended for two one-year pe riods.  The total contract could be worth $2,250,000.00 if all option years are exercised.   This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  In accordance with FAR clause 52.219-9, if a large business is selected for this contract, a Small  and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan must be submitted and approved by USACE and SBA prior to contract award.  The Subcontracting Plan is not required with this submittal.  The selected firm will be invited to negotiate an acceptable subco ntracting plan.  It is the contractors responsibility to provide realistic, challenging and achievable goals to be set forth in the subcontracting plan.  New England District encourages all small businesses to participate as prime and should consider team ing with other small businesses. Small businesses for this contract action are defined under the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) of 541330, which specifies that the firms have no more than  $4,000,000 in average annual receipts over the  past 3 fiscal years. Award of contract to the subsequently selected firm is anticipated in April or May, 2005.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiati on based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. 2.   PROJECT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineer services are required to perform inspections to determine the physical condition of selected bridges in the inventory of the North Atlantic Division, Corps of Engineers. The primary bridges to be inspected in th is contract are the Bourne and Sagamore Highway Bridges spanning the Cape Cod Canal at Bourne, MA, and the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge spanning the Cape Cod Canal at Buzzards Bay, MA.  Other bridges in the inventory are located at various Corps projects,  and range from larger (greater than 100 feet) built-up steel girder bridges over spillways and connecting dam crests to control towers, to smaller concrete or steel bridges within project reservoir areas. The Bourne and Sagamore Bridges are seven-span and  three-span, respectively, continuous truss bridges, both with a considerable portion of the 616-foot center span over 100 feet above deck level and with a 135-foot vertical clearance over the canal. Use of aerial lifts, free climbing, rigging, or combinat ion thereof, will be required to access most areas of the structures involved. Inspection of the above-deck arch portions of both the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges will require a method of access that does not require any traffic control, specifically free c limbing. In most instances, a 'Routine Inspection', as described in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Official's (AASHTO) Manual for Condition Evaluation of Bridges, will be the level of inspection required for vehicular bridges.   However, on certain structures 'Initial' or 'In-Depth' inspections may be required. The Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge has a 544-foot lift span flanked by tower spans at each end. With the lift span in the raised position, there is a 135-foot vertical cle arance over the canal.  Use of aerial lifts, free climbing, rigging, or a combination thereof, will be required to access the structure. Inspection of the mechanical ad electrical components of the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridges operating system will also  be required.  In general, a 'Periodic Inspection' as described in the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way (AREMA) Manual for Railway Engineering will be the level of inspection required. Underwater inspections may also be required. Draft inspection repo rts generally will be required within 45 days after completion of physical inspection; final inspection reports generally will be required within 14 days from receipt of draft report comments.  3. SELECTION CRITERIA:  See Note 24 for general selection process & criteria. When selecting the best firm for a contract, the Corps of Engineers normally uses the following criteria:    (1)	Primary Selection Criteria 	(a) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence - FAR 36.602-1(a)(2).  	(b) Professional Qualifications - FAR 36.602-1(a)(1).  	(c) Past Performance - FAR 36.602-1(a)(4).  	(d) Capacity - FAR 36.602-1(a)(3). 	(e) Knowledge of the Locality - FAR 36.602-1(a)(5).  Specialized Selection Criteria for this contract, in descending order of importance, are: a.  Firms must demonstrate that personnel to be involved in this work meet the required qualifications set forth in the 'National Bridge Inspection Standards' as publ ished in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR Part 650), the required qualifications as set forth in U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Regulation, ER 1110-2-111, 'Periodic Safety Inspection and Continuing Evaluation of USACE Bridges', and have completed a com prehensive training course based on the 'Bridge Inspector's Training Manual 90' from the Federal Highway Administration. More specifically, for each project the Bridge Inspection Team shall consist of a minimum of an Engineer-in-Charge for that project, Fi eld Inspection Team Leaders, and an approved number of Bridge Technical Specialists. The Engineer-in-Charge must be registered professional structural engineer in addition to having completed the cited training course. The Team Leader shall be a structural engineer who meets the minimum qualifications stated in 23 CFR Part 650, paragraph 650.307, in addition to having completed the cited training course.  Bridge Technical Specialists must either have a Bachelor of Scienc e Degree in Civil Engineering, or have an Associate Degree in Civil Engineering Technology in addition to having completed the cited training course. Mechanical and electrical engineers involved with the inspection of the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge shal l be registered professional engineers who are proficient with the methods and procedures for moveable bridges. b. The firm must demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in inspection, bridge rehabilitation work and the preparation of lo ad rating computations for major structures such as the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges and the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge. Specifically, the firm shall have successfully completed a minimum of three inspections and reports on bridges including the followin g features: ·	Steel truss bridges of total length greater than 1000 feet. ·	Steel truss bridges of which the lowest element of the superstructure is at          least 100 feet above a body of water. ·	Steel truss bridges with an extensive number of fracture critical elements         such as Steel Strand Suspender Cables, Upper Chords, Lower Chords,         Diagonals, etc., and extensive fatigue sensitive details as defined by the         American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). ·	Moveable railroad bridges.  c. The firm shall employ a sufficient number of trained personnel capable of free climbing steel structures to perform a hands-on inspection without disruption of traffic flow.  d. Sufficient Capacity to Perform Work: the firm shall have the following minimum staffing beyond Engineer-in-Charge, to perform and complete work assignments in a timely manner: ·	Two team leaders with minimum qualifications as described above. ·	Six bridge technical specialists with minimum qual ifications as described           above. ·       Two mechanical engineers with minimum qualifications as described           above.                     ·       Two electrical engineers with minimum qualifications as described above. (2) Secondary Selection Criteria 	(a) SB and SDB Participation DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(C). The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardles s of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration 	(b) Geographic Proximity FAR 36.602-1(a)(5). Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project. Hence, proximity should norma lly only be used as a selection criterion for small or routine projects or ID contracts in support of a specific installation(s).  It will have very little bearing on this selection.         (c) Volume of DoD Contract Awards DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(A).  DoD A-E contract awards can be obtained from ACASS, and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms. 4.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Standard Form (SF) 330 for Architect Engineer Qualifications became effective 8 June 2004, and replaces SFs 254 and 255.  Interested firms being able to perform this work must submit Parts I and II of the SF 330 for the prime f irm (or joint venture).   Part II of the SF 330 must also be submitted for each consultant.  Please note that a separate Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.   Submissions must be made to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Contracting Division.  Submissions must be submitted by 4:30 PM EST, on April 4, 2005. Include the firms ACASS number on t he SF 330, Part 1, Block B.

Font size shall not be less than 10 font and margins shall not be less than one inch. The New England District does not retain SF 254s or SF 330 Part IIs on file. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be cons idered for award of a Federal contract. Information regarding registration can be obtained online at www.ccr.gov or through CCR Assistance Center (CCRAC) at 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725.

We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS HEREBY BEING MODIFIED TO CORRECT PROJECT CONTROL NUMBER TO RMO25551.  ALL OTHER INFORMATION REMAINS UNCHANGED.

SOLICITATION FOR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER (CM) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2135, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO25551.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about March 16, 2005.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  The contract will cover the States of MO, KS, NE, and IA, but will have a primary geographic area.  Firms will generally receive work in the primary area, but may receive work in other parts of the four state region.  The primary geographical area is the City of Kansas City, which includes the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), the city of Columbia, MO, and the portion of the State of Missouri west of Columbia, the State of Nebraska and the State of Kansas.  Project involves:  Building construction projects having a construction cost less than $5,000,000.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, developing management plans, schedules, budgets, and studies); (2) Design Phase Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government, process contractor invoices); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting red-lined as-built drawings to CAD drawings): and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,000,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded per year is $2,000.  The maximum amount payable under this contract shall not exceed $1,000,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractor’s performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year option periods.  The successful CM contractor, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A-E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the “best value concept” in selecting a CM.  The “best value concept” is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a March 16, 2005.  Proposals shall be received in this office o/a April 19, 2005.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and (3) Management Plan.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors, however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns (see numbered note 1).  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220 and the size standard is $28.5 million 

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  


The use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy with each offer.  Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Once there you will find detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance under Help. To prepare for and register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) as identified in the CCR record.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT HAS BEEN PLACED ON HOLD DUE TO A CHANGE IN FUNDING PROFILE.  FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO THE REVISED SCHEDULE WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH FEDBIZOPPS.

	Seven T-AO 187 Class vessels are fitted with Cogenel/Alstom PTO (Power Take Off – Generation Mode)/PTI (Power Take In – Motorization Mode) systems.  These control systems are based on 1970’s analog op-amp processing technology.  These systems are outdated and hence experience supportability problems.  The cost and lead-time to obtain replacement parts results in unjustifiably long down times that are unacceptable for the ship’s role as a U.S. Naval Oiler and Replenishment Supply Ship.  Consequently, these Cogenel PTO/PTI Control Systems will be upgraded to increase reliability and extend the life of the entire PTO/PTI System.  The objective of this procurement is to contract for a replacement control system for the PTO/PTI installation. The replacement system shall be, at a minimum, a one for one replacement for the current system in terms of functionality.

<DESC>Advanced Electro-Optical/Infrared Spectral Sensor Data Analysis Software Development Request for Information NASIC/DEMZ EO-IR Spectral Data Analysis Software Request for Information 1. PURPOSE:  This is a special notice requesting information to ascertain the  capabilities of commercial industry, military contractors, and academia to  develop/provide software and algorithms to satisfy high-technology  intelligence data exploitation needs of the Advanced MASINT (Measurement and  Signature Intelligence) Research and Requirements Branch of the National Air  and Space Intelligence Center.  The needs are in addition to the capabilities  of traditional visual imagery analysis and specific areas of interest include: •	Exploiting data from multi-spectral and hyper-spectral EO-IR sensors. •	Analyzing EO-IR sensor data through algorithms/software for  identifying natural/man-made materials and targets. •	Employing Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) technologies including  signature exploitation in the EO-IR spectrum. •	Fusing data from various EO, IR, and RF sensors for better  identification performance with fewer discrepancies than any can provide  individually. •	Interfacing with complex National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF)  and other formatted data. •	Interfacing EO-IR signature libraries containing target and material  entries. •	Verifying and validating EO-IR sensor data analysis algorithms. 2. NOTICE:  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as  an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18,  Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).   Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information,  your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a  proposal. This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information  and market research for planning purposes only.   3. BACKGROUND:  One mission of DEMZ is to derive military intelligence (e.g.  identification/location of targets, materials, and threats) from any/all  passive commercial/military EO-IR sensors.  The mission is enhanced by  exploiting signatures (i.e. electromagnetic emissions and reflectance) from  natural and man-made items of interest.  To support the mission in the past,  complex algorithms have been developed and incrementally improved with each  release of a DEMZ software product called COSMEC (Common Spectral MASINT  Exploitation Capability).  Overall, COSMEC and related spectral MASINT  resources directly support NASIC’s mission to provide timely/integrated  intelligence products to the warfighter and to the intelligence, operations,  policy, and acquisition communities. 4. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Request for Information is to ascertain  state-of-the-art and the corresponding capabilities of sources to provide  subject software and contracted support to future DEMZ programs.  The scope of  DEMZ programs includes but is not limited to, the development and utilization  of exploitation tools for present and future EO-IR sensor data. 5.  RESPONSE DETAILS: Responses may be classified (up through Top Secret SCI)  or unclassified.  For classified responses, companies are to adhere to the  National Industrial Security Program Operation Manual (NISPOM) procedures for  the transmittal of classified responses.  Company responses are to include a  name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and  knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives.  If the responding company has performed similar work in the past for the U.S.  government, then include the previous government contract number.  Company  responses should include a one-page cover letter, a presentation (in text or  slide format) of up to 50 pages that describes the company’s capabilities to  address the needs in this RFI, and any applicable résumé’s. Companies are not  limited to a single response.  Although submissions will be received at any  time within one year, primary submissions are due within 30 days of this  announcement and may be made by email (if unclassified) or mailing your  response on a floppy disk (or compact disc) to the government POC as follows: Capt James Hartmetz NASIC/XPA 4180 Watson Way WPAFB, OH 45433-5648 (937) 522-2974 james.hartmetz@wpafb.af.mil Personnel hand-carrying classified responses should contact the government  point of contact to coordinate delivery. 6. CONCLUSION:  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a  continuous process for obtaining the latest information the “art of the  possible” from commercial industry, military contractors, and academia with  respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected  may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for DEMZ.   Information received as a result of this request will be considered as  sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any proprietary information received  in response to this request will be properly protected form any unauthorized  disclosure.  The Government will not use any proprietary information submitted  to establish the capability, requirements approach, or solution so as to not  inadvertently restrict competition. 7. POINTS OF CONTACT: Government point of contact for classified responses is  Capt James Hartmetz, NASIC/XPA, (937) 522-2974.

<DESC>***The RFI response date has been extended to 5pm EST on Wednesday, March 9th, 2005 *** 

Request for Information – Laboratory and Medical Supplies/Equipment

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is implementing a strategic sourcing program to increase efficiencies and drive savings across its operating and staff divisions.  As part of this strategic sourcing initiative, a Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to aid in the identification of firms who have the capabilities to provide Laboratory & Medical Supplies/Equipment to DHHS.  DHHS plans to acquire these Laboratory & Medical Supplies/Equipment from current General Services Administration (GSA) Medical Equipment and Supplies, Invitro Diagnostics, Reagents, Test Kits/Test Sets, and Chemistry, Biochemistry, Clinical Instruments, General Purpose Laboratory Instruments and Services Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) holders.  To respond to this RFI, a firm must hold a current FSS that includes Special Item Numbers 65 II A, 66 II N, and 65 VII. 

This RFI seeks information from FSS holders that can demonstrate that they have the resources and capabilities to best support all or part of this requirement.  Given the complexity and size of this requirement, DHHS strongly encourages small business participation either individually or as a joint venture team, consortium, or similar arrangement. DHHS will use the information obtained from this RFI and other market research techniques to identify GSA FSS holders who possess the capability, either solely or through a subcontract/teaming arrangement, to provide the required Laboratory & Medical Supplies/Equipment to the broad range of geographically dispersed DHHS organizations.  

For more information, please review the synopsis in full and the attached RFI documents (Excel workbook).

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE PREVIOUS NOTICE POSTED ON 02/24/2005. This is only a Request For Information (RFI), not a Request For Proposal (RFP) and all information received will be for planning purposes only. The CECOM Acquisition Center does not itend to award a contract on the basis of your reponses nor ot herwise pay for the preparations of any information presented or the use of any such information. All proprietary information should be marked as such.  The response date for this RFI is April 15, 2005. The Technical Point of Contact is Mr. Robert Burrus, Phone 732-427-0772 or E-mail robert.burrus@mail1.monmouth.army.mil PLEASE ADDRESS ANY QUESTION TO THE TECHNIAL POC VIA THE E-MAIL ADDRESS POSTED ABOVE. ALL QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED WEEKLY (EVERY FRIDAY) FOR ALL TO VIEW ON THE FEDBIZOPS SITE.  The US Army PM Firefinder currently manages an aging target acquisition counter fire radar system AN/TPQ-36(V) 8.  The EQ-36 System would provide improved operational and physical functionality over the existing AN/TPQ-36(V) 8 radar.  The EQ-36 System must  have increase accuracy and range, be an affordable, highly mobile and transportable ruggedized battlefield radar system with improved throughput, reduced crew size (four), and fewer vehicles.  Phase I of the EQ-36 program will emphasize radar performance in a 90 degree sector coverage pattern.  The 90 degree search sector shall be capable of being moved and steered through the 6400 mil sector without repositioning the vehicle and/or trailer on which the antenna is mounted.  The width of the search sector s hall be operator selectable from 230 mils to 1600 mils.  A spiral development program is planned to ultimately increase the search sector to a 360 degree coverage capability.  The Phase 1 the system designs and equipment architecture shall ensure a cost ef fective path forward of the 360 degree capability.  The EQ-36 System shall collect, process, store, display, and digitally transmit day/night mortar, cannon, and rocket counter-fire target acquisition data to the controlling Command and Control (C2) archit ecture via Combat Net Radio and LAN.  Stored data shall also be able to be transmitted manually, automatically, and, while on the move, using two-way digital communications.  The EQ-36 System architecture shall emphasize Built In Test (BIT), and embedded t raining to ensure ease of Soldier operation and maintenance in the field.  The EQ-36 System radar shall be capable of supporting forces in most operational environments to include urban and complex clutter/terrain, and be ruggedized to operate in these env ironments.  The system shall incorporate self locating/self survey capabilities/techniques that provide sufficient Northing, Easting, and Altitude (N,E,A) grid coordinate accuracy to ensure that the target location requirements as specified in Table 1 are met.  The EQ-36 shall also be capable of accepting survey data (N,E,A and direction) through manual download.  Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED levels 1 and 2) and meteorological data shall be used and easily imported into the system.  Radar system arc hitecture shall not preclude the use of higher levels of DTED.  Weapon classification shall be as light, medium or heavy subtypes and caliber as a goal.  The secondary mission is to provide accurate 'did hit' data of artillery, cannon, and rocket friendly fires.  'State Vectors' for targets shall be available for transmission.  It is desired that the system complete the basic elements of transmitting, receiving, processing, and digital target reporting within 10 seconds (current Message Transfer Protocol St andards) of weapon firing.  It is envisioned that the EQ-36 System will have at least two hardware configurations to ensure functional operation in all threat environments while maintaining an efficient and safe environment for the soldier.  A 'mission ess ential' configuration is required to accomplish a rapid insertion of the EQ-36 System by a singl e C-130 sortie.  Rapid emplacement/displacement and mobility of the system to support initial insertions is required.  A second 'sustainment' configuration is envisioned to be used for mid to long term protection of high priority assets (like airports, com mand posts, etc.) and requires a shelter that provides crew protection against ballistic nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons.  The shelter shall be equipped with an ECU (environmental control unit) and a GPFU (gas particulate filter unit).  Pha se 1 of the EQ-36 Program will develop and deliver the 'mission essential' configuration and develop the system designs and equipment architecture to ensure a cost effective implementation of the 'sustainment' configuration to be implemented and delivered in Phase II of the program.  For each configuration it is mandatory that the EQ-36 System be hardened to protect against loss of critical platform functionality after exposure to physical destructive threats from conventional explosive ordnance,and to non- conventional ordnance (NBC weapons).  The system shall also be able to withstand nuclear effects from HEMP (High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse) and high power microwave radiation.  The EQ-36 System shall be operable and maintainable by personnel wearing M OPP IV gear and be able to withstand decontamination.  The EQ-36 System shall be able to perform its missions in an electronic warfare environment and operate with minimal adverse effects or system degradation.  The EQ-36 System shall be able to operate in  blackout mode without degrading normal operations. For complete specifications and additional information please go to the following website: https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/ Go to the Army Pre-Award Drop Down box, select CECOM Market Research and press the Go button. From the market research listing select 'Enhanced AN/TPQ-36 Counter Fire Radar (EQ-36)'. Next scroll down and select the attachment titled 'EQ-36 RFI Final Feb 23  05'.

REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKING FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)
The following procedures are excerpted from Department Homeland Security Management Directive 11042 entitled ¡§Safeguarding Sensitive but Unlassified (For Official Use Only) Information¡¨ and shall be followed:

Marking

1.	Information designated as FOUO will be sufficiently marked so that persons having access to it are aware of its sensitivity and protection requirements.  The lack of FOUO markings on materials does not relieve the holder from safeguarding responsibilities.  Where the FOUO marking is not present on materials known by the holder to be FOUO, the holder of the material will protect it as FOUO.  Other sensitive information protected by statute or regulation, e.g., PCII and SSI, etc., will be marked in accordance with the applicable guidance for that type of information.  Information marked in accordance with the guidance provided for the type of information need not be additionally marked FOUO.

(a)	Prominently mark the bottom of the front cover, first page, title page, back cover and each individual page containing FOUO information with the caveat ¡§FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.¡¨

(b)	Materials containing specific types of FOUO may be further marked with the applicable caveat, e.g., ¡§LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE,¡¨ in order to alert the reader of the type of information conveyed.  Where the sensitivity of the information warrants additional access and dissemination restrictions, the originator may cite additional access and dissemination restrictions.  For example:  

WARNING: This document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO).  It is to be controlled, stored, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information.  This information shall not be distributed beyond the original addressees without prior authorization of the originator.

(c)	Materials being transmitted to recipients outside of DHS, for example, other federal agencies, state or local officials, etc. who may not be aware of what the FOUO caveat represents, shall include the following additional notice:

WARNING: This document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO).  It contains information that may be exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).  It is to be controlled, stored, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information and is not to be released to the public or other personnel who do not have a valid ¡§need-to-know¡¨ without prior approval of an authorized DHS official.  

(d)	Computer storage media, i.e., disks, tapes, removable drives, etc., containing FOUO information will be marked ¡§FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.¡¨  

(e)	Portions of a classified document, i.e., subjects, titles, paragraphs, and subparagraphs that contain only FOUO information will be marked with the abbreviation (FOUO).

(f)	Individual portion markings on a document that contains no other designation are not required.  

(g)	Designator or originator information and markings, downgrading instructions, and date/event markings are not required.

General Handling Procedures

Although FOUO is the DHS standard caveat for identifying sensitive unclassified information, some types of FOUO information may be more sensitive than others and thus warrant additional safeguarding measures beyond the minimum requirements established in this manual.  For example, certain types of information may be considered extremely sensitive based on the repercussions that could result should the information be released or compromised.  Such repercussions could be the loss of life or compromise of an informant or operation.  Additional control requirements may be added as necessary to afford appropriate protection to the information.  DHS employees, contractors, and detailees must use sound judgment coupled with an evaluation of the risks, vulnerabilities, and the potential damage to personnel or property as the basis for determining the need for safeguards in excess of the minimum requirements and protect the information accordingly.

1.	When removed from an authorized storage location and persons without a need-to-know are present, or where casual observation would reveal FOUO information to unauthorized persons, a ¡§FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY¡¨ cover sheet will be used to prevent unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure.

2.	When forwarding FOUO information, a FOUO cover sheet should be placed on top of the transmittal letter, memorandum or document.

3.	When receiving FOUO equivalent information from another government agency, handle in accordance with the guidance provided by the other government agency.  Where no guidance is provided, handle in accordance with the requirements of this directive.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334220   This is a notice of intent/sources sought, not a Request for Proposals or solicitation.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to award a sole source contract to Motorola for new trunked land mobile radio systems.  The BOP requires new trunked land mobile radio systems to provide communications for Officer Safety and Institutional Operations.  The BOP anticipates the awarded contract will be a firm fixed-price requirements type contract with a base period and four one-year options.  The estimated quantity for this requirement is 20 to 25 systems over the performance period.  The radio systems acquired by the BOP must operate within narrowband specifications established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  The BOP currently uses a Motorola “Smartnet” infrastructure and subscriber units to meet our communications needs.  The proposed equipment must be compatible with BOP’s existing land mobile radio (LMR) assets at approximately 85 institutions so that LMR resources can be redistributed nationwide in emergency situations.  Included in this trunked radio system is the requirement that all radios and body alarms must operate on the 3600 baud control channel and operate in a UHF 406-420 MHz band. BOP requires a “turnkey” effort to include the system design, the furnishing of all equipment, site preparation, complete systems integration, installation, testing, training, and warranty.  The systems must have a flexible infrastructure design and a modular architecture to readily accommodate future expansion of repeaters, talkgroups, dispatch console positions, conventional nets, and subscribers.  The systems shall be software upgradable to incorporate future technology.  The trunked systems shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use.  The systems must support dispatch console operator positions and system management equipment.  The radio systems shall incorporate a dispatch console sub-system that will allow BOP personnel to access any voice channel on the system.  The dispatch consoles shall be PC based, use a standard operating system and operate in a standard Ethernet LAN environment.  The console shall incorporate fault tolerant electronics and shall accept software updates to refresh its technology.  The dispatch positions and the trunked system infrastructure shall be linked via dedicated phone lines.  Should additional console positions be required in the future, the system shall be able to accommodate them.  The contract will also include technology refreshment clauses.  As the BOP has the Motorola trunked radio systems installed at approximately 85 institutions, it is determined that they are the only provider capable of supplying the compatible trunked land radio system at other BOP sites.  This proposed noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12 and 15.  It is the intent to award to Motorola, Incorporated, 7031 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, Maryland, 21046.  Other sources may identify their interest in this procurement and capability to respond to the requirement in writing.  Any information shall be clearly marked with Reference: NAS-0190-2005 and must be received on or before March 22, 2005 by 12 noon (local Washington, DC time).  Any information not received by the date/time and at the location specified in this notice will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contact action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the Government’s discretion.  Information received will generally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Points of contact for this requirement are Tonya McClinton, Contract Specialist, or Hector Vega, Contract Specialist (Phone 202-616-6150 and Fax 202-307-1146).  Questions related to this synopsis may also be addressed to Sandra Bellinger, Contracting Officer, at (202) 616-6150.  Responses may be submitted to:  Federal Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street NW - 5006, Washington, DC 20534.

<DESC>Because several business units at PBGC produce great volumes of documents which are records, a large percentage of which are in electronic format, PBGC is very interested in and concerned about electronic records management (ERM) and legacy email management.  As a result, PBGC has studied the market place for ERM systems and based on its research, has formulated certain draft specifications for an ERM system for the agency.  In order to ascertain whether these specifications are realistic and/or optimal, the agency is making available for public comment a Request for Information (RFI) for an ERM system with legacy e-mail and electronic document archiving, database records management capability, near-line hierarchical storage, possibly document management, and related services.

Clips will include the full text of print articles referenced in the briefings and full transcripts of relevant network news stories.  The WHNS will be accompanied by two clips packages; the first organized by media outlet and the second arranged so the order of clips matches the sequence of stories in the briefing.  The ONDCPNB will be accompanied by a single clips package, organized to match story sequence in the ONDCPNB.

The WHNS and clips shall be delivered seven days a week, by email to the White House Press Office by 6:20 am Eastern Time (ET)  Monday through Friday and by 9:30 am ET on Saturday and Sunday.  It shall be simultaneously published to a IP-protected web site hosted by the contractor and made available to all EOP staff.  On short notice, the WHNS may require additional versions of the briefings to be prepared as early as 1:00 am ET, for example, to capture news releases when the President travels overseas.   The ONDCPNB shall be delivered by email by 7:45 am ET, Monday through Friday to the ONDCP’s Office of Public Affairs.

2. CONTRACT OBJECTIVE.  
SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development: The Contractor shall assist the PAD and USAJFKSWCS by conducting the piloting and modification of SF Junior Leader 360 survey, preparation of survey utilization monographs, validation research documentation, and preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey feedback instruments. The goal of SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development is to generate reliable, valid, and efficiently manageable 360-degree surveys and feedback instrumentation unique to Special Forces for use in implementing the SF LEADER 360 Program.
3.  REQUIREMENTS.
3.1. SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the piloting and modification as well as the preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey is a multi-rater assessment instrument where targeted leaders rate themselves and are rated by superiors, peers and subordinates on knowledge, skills and attributes essential for success as an SF leader.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development involves several phases of work to include Pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument, preparation of a utilization monograph, preparing supportive validation research reports, and final operational feedback instrumentation development. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, while primarily targeted to Captains during their team leader time, may also be targeted to Warrant Officers and Majors during their tenure as assistant team leaders and company commanders.  Work may take place at all DoD posts and NG installations CONUS or OCONUS that serve as locations for SF units, including pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey with a representative sample population of active duty and National Guard SF units.  
3.2. Survey Development Timelines. This represents a close-ended contract that will end on 1 October 2005. During the duration of this contract the following major tasks will be accomplished: Completion of an operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey focusing on Team Leaders and Company Commanders, to include survey pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument, preparation of a utilization monograph, complete supportive validation research reports, finalize all feedback instrumentation, and complete an operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey.  The Contractor will be required to provide sufficient developers and administrative support personnel to insure delivery of the final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey by 1 October 2005. 
4.  TASKS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.
4.1.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development. The Contractor completes the development of an SF unique operational edition of an SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey for use in the SF LEADER 360 Implementation Program.  Contractor responsibility for the completion of development of SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey involves the following subtasks:
4.1.1	   SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey data reports development.  Item and scale information derived from the 360 instrument results must be reflected effectively in reports that facilitate the feedback process, which is the key component to any 360-degree feedback program.  The contractor is responsible for developing clear, coherent reports that make maximal use of instrument data for purposes of providing effective feedback to developing leaders.  Report content and design is developed in conjunction with the consultation to the target group, subject matter experts in the area of developmental feedback, and other subject matter experts knowledgeable in the area of 360-instrument development and execution.  The contractor is responsible for conducting meetings with critical individuals and panel groups to ensure that the end product is useful to both the target of the 360 instrument and to the professionals who will be tasked to use the reports in their respective developmental programs.  
4.1.2.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey pilot testing and pilot version modification and completion of initial operational version of the instrument.  Once an initial pilot version of the 360 instrument is developed, pilot testing of the instrument on a subset of potential targets is necessary to allow for final revisions of items sets, scales, and reports prior to initiating the use of the instrument in regular practice.  Pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey will include a representative sample population of active duty and National Guard SF units.  
The data obtained from the pilot testing provides the necessary data to improve and streamline item sets and instrument length pursuant to the development of a more efficient and effective instrument.  Pilot testing is required for any instrument prior to any formal introduction of an instrument for routine use.   
4.2.   SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Modification. Based on an analysis of the information and data gathered during the piloting process, modifications will be made to the instrument and a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey will be prepared along with all supportive documentation necessary to implement the use of the instrument.  The Contractor shall make modifications to The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey to maintain currency and relevance to the tasks and requirements of leadership in the units the instrument serves.  Changes in mission profiles and doctrine occur over time and must be reflected in the content of 360 instruments.  An example is the midcourse revisions made on the SF Senior Leader 360 following the initiation of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  Critical task behaviors demonstrated by successful leaders in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have required a re-evaluation of the item sets and general content that needed to be reflected in a relevant, current instrument for SF leaders.  Consequently, substantial revisions of items and scales were made in the SF Senior Leader 360 instrument prior to pilot testing.  All developmental instruments require periodic review and update to maintain relevance and efficacy.  The contractor shall be required to re-evaluate the relevance of existing instrument versions periodically as directed by the Government to ensure that developmental instruments remain optimally effective.
4.3.  SF Junior leader 360-degree Survey Documentation/Reports: The Contractor shall provide both verbal and written assessments of instrument efficacy and accuracy.  Verbal assessments will be presented to the Psychological Applications Directorate, USASOC, appropriate leadership at the USAJFKSWCS, and any other command or development entity as directed by the Government representative.  The contractor shall schedule and arrange of all necessary travel, schedule the coordination of panel membership and conduct of these and other subject matter panel meetings, keep all records from all panel meetings, manage the initial data related to item and scale development and management and analysis of pilot testing related data.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for the design and development of reports and briefs to command elements and other government representatives and their respective offices. The Contractor will assist pilot testing participants in understanding their Feedback Report and gather data on participants’ perceptions of the pilot SF 360s. Modifications to the Feedback Report may be required based upon participant perceptions of it clarity and effectiveness.
4.4.  The contractor will provide a technical manual that describes, at a minimum, the following:
	a.  Instrument development process
	b.  Descriptions of the scales and what meaning should be ascribed to the scales during feedback.

Evaluation Section:  
1.     GENERAL.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government on the basis of (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance and (3) PRICE, as explained below.
2.     Technical.  The Government will assess the technical capability of each offeror on the following areas.   The Government will NOT assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.
a.  Approach to completion of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, to include a proposed timeline for completion.   
b.  Method for providing Quality Control over daily work performance and procedures for corrective action.
c.  Special Benefits.
3.  Past Performance.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe:  (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.  The Government will not evaluate an offeror's organizational past performance on the basis of the personal past performance of the offeror's key personnel.  The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.
4.  Price.  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability.  Price will be evaluated on the basis of price analysis if adequate competition is obtained.
5.    Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors.  Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government considers an offeror's Technical Capability to be more important than Past Performance or  Price.  The elements of Technical are in descending order of importance.  However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offerors.  See Source Selection Decision, below.
6.   Source Selection Decision.  In order to select the winning offeror, the Government will rank the offerors from best to worst.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection authority will decide whether the difference in capability is worth the difference in price.  If the source selection authority considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.  The Source Selection Authority will continue to make paired comparisons until he or she has decided which offeror represents the best value.

STATEMENT OF WORK
COAST GUARD DIFFERENTIAL GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM 
PERSONAL EXPOSURE LIMIT AND RADIATION HAZARDS STUDY
1	GENERAL.
1.1	Background:  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates 84 ground based Differential Global Positioning (DGPS) Radio Frequency (RF) Medium Frequency (MF) broadcast sites, transmitting a Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) signal in the 285KHz through 325KHz frequency range, throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  All of these DGPS broadcast sites emit RF energy that can be harmful to the human body if enough RF radiation is absorbed.  The USCG publishes the Commandant Instruction Manual (CIM) 10550.25A, the United States Coast Guard Electronics Manual (EM), which includes Chapter 4.1.10 concerning RF Radiation Hazards (RADHAZ) and Personal Exposure Limit (PEL) criteria as established by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and other Federal safety standards (see References below).  Chapter 4.1.10 of the EM declares a standard and generic 25 foot PEL limit for all DGPS sites, regardless of tower height, output RF power, or consideration for unique ground conductivity existing at each site.  The government has discovered PEL boundaries to be more or less than the generic 25 foot standard specified in the EM, using RF Personal Monitors (RFPM).  The purpose of all tasks outlined in this statement of work (SOW) is to update, correct, simplify, and improve the Coast Guards’ RF RADHAZ/PEL policies and safety practices.
