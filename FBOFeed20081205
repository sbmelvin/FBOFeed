<DESC>ERIC is the world's largest and most frequently used digital library of education, comprised of more than 1.2 million bibliographic records and more than 214,000 full-text materials indexed from 1966 to the present. Each ERIC bibliographic record contains an abstract of a journal article or non-journal document (e.g., technical report, conference paper), along with index information such as author, title, and publication date.

The mission of ERIC is to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-use, searchable, Internet-based bibliographic and full-text database of education research and information for educators, researchers, and the general public.  Terms defining the ERIC mission are explained as follows: 

·	Comprehensive: The ERIC digital library consists of journal articles and non-journal materials, including materials not published by commercial publishers, which are directly related to education.  

·	Easy-to-use and searchable: ERIC users will be able to find the education information they need quickly and efficiently.  

·	Electronic: ERIC operations will be electronic to the maximum extent feasible.  The digital library will reside on the ERIC website at http://www.eric.ed.gov, will link to libraries, publishers, and commercial sources of journal articles, and will be made available to commercial database vendors. 

·	Bibliographic and full-text: Bibliographic records will convey the information users need in a simple and straightforward manner, and whenever possible, full-text journal articles and non-journal materials will be included for free in the digital library.  Other full-text articles and materials, whenever possible, will be immediately available for purchase through an online link with publishers and other information sources.  

The government-sponsored website<www.eric.ed.gov> provides free access to the ERIC digital library. ERIC is also re-distributed under terms of a license agreement.  Various subscription services and freely available Internet search engines provide access to ERIC: Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, EBSCO, Google and Google Scholar, MSN, OCLC, OVID, ProQuest, Silver Platter, Thomson Dialog, and Yahoo.  Several statewide networks  (Ohio, Texas, Kentucky, and North Carolina), regional consortia, international services providers, and large university systems also provide access to ERIC.  

Acquisition agreements with journal publishers and education membership associations, other education organizations, universities, state education agencies, and other sources of non-journals materials provide source materials for the ERIC digital library.   About 826 journals are indexed in ERIC (nearly all of these are indexed comprehensively, or cover-to-cover), and links are provided to the publishers' Web sites for access to full-text materials and to the Online Computer Library Corporation’s (OCLC) World Cat so that users can link to electronic resources in their libraries.  Roughly 650 non-journal sources, including associations and government agencies, provide and authorize dissemination of content to ERIC through acquisition agreements.

Searches of the ERIC digital library have grown dramatically during the modernization phase beginning with the contract awarded in 2004. In 2007, there were 93 million searches of ERIC; in 2006, 62 million searches; and in 2005, the search volume was roughly 52 million.  While complete utilization data was not captured prior to 2005, an estimated 7 million searches were reported from three web sites in 2001.

Modernization of ERIC resulted in the current consolidated digital library model, transitioning from a paper and microfiche collection built over a period of about 35 years by the 16 ERIC clearinghouses.  The entire microfiche collection of about 350,000  full-text documents has been converted to digital images files, and individual records are available through Interlibrary Loan facilitated by the National Library of Education. Of this number, some 96,000 records are available full-text in the ERIC digital library because copyright permission for dissemination has been granted. 

The Department of Education (ED) seeks to award one contract with either a vendor or a team of vendors to operate the online bibliographic and full-text ERIC digital library of education journal articles and non-journal materials that is highly efficient and easy-to-use for educators, researchers, and the general public. The following general tasks comprise the work required and are detailed in the SOW: manage all aspects of the ERIC digital library, provide reports, communicate with the ERIC community; acquire and link to library materials; select and process library materials; develop, maintain, and secure the information technology system; transition between contracts; and provide for future innovations (this is an optional task).   The full RFP will be released on www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about December 19, 2008.  The anticipated response date will be approximately January 30, 2009.

Potential offerors are invited to submit information that allows the government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors for the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) solicitation to be published subsequent to the evaluation of the presolicitation responses in accordance with FAR 15.202.

ED has identified ERIC as an IT project subject to the Information Technology Investment Management Process.  (ED's definition of an “information technology project” is based on the definitions of “information technology” found in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and OMB Circular A-11.”).  Additional classification for ERIC includes the following: Level 3 IT project (high interest project with the general public); Major Business Case reporting Exhibit 300 and Earned Value Management reports.

ED's security policy requirements include compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB Circulars, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidance.  Successful certification and accreditation of the IT system must be completed before the online system is introduced.

Because of these operational requirements, vendors that intend to compete for the ERIC RFP must respond to the following request for information by December 17, 2008:

Question 1:

Is the contractor's proposed Project Director experienced and a currently certified Project Manager Professional (PMP)?  Provide a brief statement of 3 pages or less describing the magnitude of the project managed, years of experience, credentials, and attach a copy of relevant certification certificates.

Question 2:

Has the contractor received Certification and Accreditation for an IT system by any federal executive department within the last 3 years?  Provide a brief statement of 3 pages or less describing the function and scale of the system, including system impact level, documents prepared, and length of time for the successful completion of the process.  Provide the name and contact information of the COR monitoring the Certification and Accreditation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Responses will be evaluated according to the following criteria with a summary conclusion of recommended or not recommended to respond to the forthcoming ERIC RFP.  

Question 1:

Copy of current PMP certification required.  Copies of any additional relevant certifications and length of experience managing IT Level 3 projects and higher.

Question 2:

Copy of current C&A certificate. Clarity and completeness of response describing C&A events.

A draft SOW is provided with this pre-solicitation notice.  All potential offerors are invited to comment on the draft SOW.  The Government will take potential questions and concerns into account when finalizing the RFP.  The final date to provide comments is December 18, 2008. All comments shall be submitted by email to Tiffany.Johnson@ed.gov.  This is a full & open procurement and is open to all responsible sources.

ED anticipates an award date of approximately March 10, 2009.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of one hundred (100) CRT Electron Tubes, NSN in support of the Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE3).  The ASDE3 is an integral part of the Air Traffic Control System.  The ASDE3 is used in conjunction with the Airport Movement Safety System (AMASS).  The CRT Electron Tube is a vital component in the EDL display.  Without the display, the Air Traffic Controller would not be able to monitor the airport runway, resulting in dangerous situations that would compromise the NAS mission and safety for the flying public and airport personnel.
The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract.  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Quest International, Irvine, CA, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
A market survey was conducted on April 4, 2008, through April 12, 2008, and the results of this survey supported the determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  This announcement is for information purposes only.

<DESC>The Materials Division (Code 60) of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement to extend the capabilities of an existing Solartron 1470E potentiostat to allow for simultaneous measurement of a capacitor and battery anode, cathode, and total cell impedance over time.  NSWCCD intends to award a non-competitive firm-fixed-price purchase order to Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. in Oak Ridge, TN using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to procure eight (8) Solartron 14558 Frequency Response Analyzers (FRA).  The Solartron 14558 FRA is an 8-channel, 1 MHz system designed specifically for use with NSWCCD's existing potentiostat.  Along with NSWCCD's existing software, the Solartron FRA 14558 will also provide the capability to integrate impedance testing over the required frequency range (10 uhz and 1 MHz) during standard charge/discharge cycle testing.  In addition, the integration of the Solartron 14558 will fully automate long term!  capacitor and battery testing which will improve the accuracy of the date obtained and result in considerable labor savings.  All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), Children’s Bureau (CB) requires technical and logistical support for all components of the Child Welfare Reviews Project, including the Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR), the title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews (IV-E FCER), and the State Team Training Project (STTP).

Child and Family Services Reviews:

The Children’s Bureau is responsible for reviewing State agencies’ child welfare programs and services by conducting periodic Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSRs).  The CFSRs are designed to examine outcomes of services provided to children and families, as well as, systemic factors that affect the ability of State agencies to achieve positive outcomes for children and families.  

The overall goal of the CFSRs is to assist States in improving child welfare services and outcomes for families and children by identifying the strengths and needs within State programs.  The CFSR also identifies those areas where technical assistance and the development and implementation of a Program Improvement Plan could lead to program improvements.  . 

A wide range of federally funded child welfare programs and services are examined during the review process, including child protective services, foster care, adoption, family preservation/family support and independent living services.

Other purposes of the CFSR strategy include the following:

•	Linking the CFSRs to existing Children’s Bureau Regional Office and States joint planning, technical assistance and program improvement processes;
	
•	Assisting States in becoming more self-evaluating over time;
	
•	Ensuring that Federal funds are spent in accordance with Federal statute, regulation and policy;

•	Collecting data that will inform national policy;
	
•	Identifying best practices that can be emulated across the country;
	
•	Identifying State training and technical assistance needs and providing access to assistance needed to implement a program improvement plan (PIP); and

•	Providing timely and specific feedback to States that is directly related to program performance and outcomes.


Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews:

The Children’s Bureau is also responsible for conducting title IV-E FCERs to assist in the validation of the accuracy of a State’s claim for reimbursement of payments made on behalf of eligible children placed in licensed or approved foster family homes and child care institutions.  These periodic IV-E FCER more specifically:

•	Help determine whether Federal funds have been spent on behalf of eligible children;
•	Help identify improper payments, which consist of underpayments and erroneous payments, overpayments, duplicate payments, and otherwise ineligible program payments;
•	Provide a link to the joint planning, technical assistance, and program improvement processes that exist between the Children’s Bureau and the States; and
•	Provide timely and specific feedback to States that can directly impact the proper and efficient administration and implementation of their title IV-E foster care maintenance payments programs.

States that are determined to not be in substantial compliance based on the primary review are required  to develop and implement Program Improvement Plans designed to correct identified areas of non-compliance.  

State Team Training Project:

The State Team Training Project (STTP) was created to provide program and logistical support, as well as, periodic training of non-Federal consultant reviewers who assist in the Child and Family Services Reviews.  The project is responsible for developing curricula and training State child welfare agencies for participation in the CFSR process.  The STTP also provides training to States on the automation of the CFSR onsite review instruments through group instruction and the electronic training platform (e-training).

Within a four-year period all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will undergo a CFSR.  The specific number of reviews per years may vary and is subject to change.  The Children’s Bureau estimates that approximately 60 participants will attend each State’s training, as follows:

•	38 State staff and representatives
•	4 co-leaders
•	5 Cross State Participants
•	Alternates as needed(up to 5)
•	Remaining slots for extra cross state participants and others approved for training
•	3 children’s Bureau Regional Office staff
•	1 Children’s Bureau Central Office staff person 

Approximately 3 Federal Regional Office staff and 1 Federal Central Office staff will participate in each training session as attendees to receive and discuss updated information. 

For the purpose of this contract, the Contractor must have a working knowledge of child welfare and title IV-E programs, legislation and policies, including title IV-E Error Rate and potential corrective actions; of child welfare program improvement efforts and approaches for systemic change of child welfare agencies; and an understanding of child welfare evaluation and monitoring techniques.  The Contractor must demonstrate the experience and/or ability to perform the following identified tasks:

1.	Develop child welfare evaluations and monitoring training curriculum;
2.	Provide child welfare evaluation and monitoring training;
3.	Recruit, train and sustain a consultant workforce experienced in child welfare and monitoring;
4.	Provide a system for screening and evaluating performance of consultants;
5.	Develop a data management system that includes data related to logistical planning for the Child and Family Services Reviews, onsite review findings, Program Improvement Plans, and an e-training platform.;  
6.	Automate child welfare monitoring instruments;
7.	Institute procedures for quality control and review of all processes related to Child and Family Services Reviews, and IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews.; 
8.	Institute a process for engaging legislators and child welfare agency administrators to effect programmatic and systemic change;
9.	Conduct research;
10.	Produce reports, briefs, manuals and other relevant documents;
11.	Perform technical and statistical analyses;
12.	Organize and manage travel logistics for consultant and peer reviewers across and within all 50 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia; and
13.	Coordinate meeting and conference planning for CFSR and IV-E FCER related activities occurring across the United States.


Please be advised this is not a grant.  This requirement will be solicited and awarded under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procedures using full and open competion.  The award will be a contract.  The period of performance will be an 18  month base period with four, one year option periods anticipated to start on April 1, 2009.

It is the intent of the Government to initially award four (4) contracts from the Unrestricted selection and two (2) from the Small-Business Set-Aside. The Unrestricted basis is open to all interested parties regardless of business size. The Small Business size standard is a maximum of $4.5 million of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years. All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting. All firms must state the words (UNRESTRICTED) or (SMALL BUSINESS) after the solicitation number in PART I, A.  Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total IDC contract value not to exceed $10,000,000 for Unrestricted basis over the five-year life of the contract and $5,000,000 for Small-Business Set-Aside over the five-year life of the contract. A firm fixed price contract will be negotiated. Contracts awarded will not exceed a term of five years. Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiation.

<p><br />Requirement</p>
<p>Air Education and Training Command Specialized Contracting Squadron (AETC CONS) has a requirement to strategically source refuse collection and recycling services at 18 bases within the command and across the Southwest Region. The total estimated annual refuse tonnage is 60,000 tons. A breakdown of bases where services are to be performed along with estimated annual tonnages is included at Attachment #1. The two services are to be combined into one Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) program. The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services necessary to conduct a Resource Management approach to ISWM. Additionally, the ISWM service provider must comply with all federal and DoD regulations for waste stream diversion and mandatory materials recycling.</p>
<p>Description of Services</p>
<p>To perform effective Resource Management, the contractor must be able to minimize refuse collection and disposal costs while maximizing recycling revenues through integration of the refuse and recycling programs. This shall be performed under the lead or guidance of the prime ISWM service provider. The primary or lead service provider shall make use of all available base resources to maximize recycling revenue and simultaneously divert recyclable materials from being disposed of into landfills. This will create cost avoidance in the refuse collection and disposal arena while simultaneously providing additional material for generating recycling revenue. The intent of the program is to create a self sufficient recycling program which can be provided at zero cost, with additional recycling revenue offsetting refuse collection and disposal costs. For more information on Resource Management/Integrated Solid Waste Management, visit the Environmental Protection Agency's respective website at: http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/wastewise/wrr/rm.htm</p>
<p>The service provider will be incentivized to reduce costs through a revenue sharing program with the Government. The service provider's final profit will be based upon recycling self sufficiency and a targeted reduction of landfill waste. The service provider will be allowed to use various methods to reduce landfill tonnages by creatively utilizing the solid waste for any application, with landfill disposal being the final option. All existing government equipment utilized for collecting and processing recyclable materials will be authorized. However, it is expected that the contractor will significantly expand the collection, segregation, and processing regime. <br />This service provider shall provide the services of refuse collection in a manner that meets or exceeds the standards as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The PWS is not available as of the publication date of this notice, but will be posted with the RFP along with all Appendices and Attachments.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Title - Litigation Support
Response Date:	19 Dec  2008, 3 pm EST
This notice is not a request for proposal.  This is a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to support a classified litigation, previously awarded as a sole source contract.  The information received will allow the government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the program for planning purposes only.  Therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for information submitted except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. Any response is strictly voluntary on the respondents part.
If after reviewing this information, you desire to participate in responding to this sources sought, you should provide documentation that supports your companys capabilities in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.).  Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this sources sought research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.

Background

CMS operates as a health plan under HIPAA, as well as a federal agency that is subject to the Privacy Act.  Recently, there have been numerous security and privacy breaches reported in the news, including data losses by federal agencies and their contractors.  As a result, federal agencies are now subject to additional OMB requirements involving risk assessment for identity theft and breach notification.  

The continued heightened awareness of privacy and identity theft is coming at the same time the CMS is becoming more than a payer of health care services and being recognized as a key contributor to public health.  Part of that transformation involves the sharing of CMS data with organizations and entities that are unprecedented.  This transformation is expected to continue with the new Administration.  The agency will be disclosing personal health information to conduct expanded program operations and studies that promote high value health care and consumer informed choice, along with programs that promote quality and transparency and improve the interoperability of data systems across the health system.   All of these initiatives must be conducted within the legal and regulatory framework, in compliance with the federal privacy requirements and OMB guidelines.  

Expertise Being Sought

CMS’ Office of E-Health Standards and Services is seeking contractors who are capable of assisting in addressing privacy matters as they relate to the incoming administration’s health care goals and initiatives.  Deliverables during the contract life may include, but not limited to providing expert advice, consultation and written products, such as white papers.   
CMS is searching for contractors that have a broad range of experience, knowledge and expertise. In order to respond to this notice, contractors shall demonstrate experience with and or be able to perform (experience and or ability to provide) all of the following as well as
justify the capabilities and experience:

• Governmental Affairs 
• Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
• Privacy Advocacy

• HIPAA Privacy Rule 
• Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and other privacy/security related standards and guidelines, such as those published by the Office of Management and Budget and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  
• Knowledge of current trends in information sharing that include health information concerns and approaches to increase interoperability among the public and private sectors for such things as personal and Electronic Health Records and Provider Quality Performance and Measurement 
• Strategic Analysis of issues related to privacy and help the agency clarify and resolve common data governance challenges that ensure the appropriate balance between Medicare and Medicaid program requirements and privacy  
• Development of deliverables that research solutions ensuring privacy, security, trust, and agency compliance within a potentially new data sharing environment. 
 
Please also include the following in your response:

Business Information --
a. DUNS: 
b. Company Name 
c. Company Address 
d. Current GSA Schedules appropriate to this Sources Sought 
e. Do you have a Government approved accounting system?  If so, please identify the agency that approved the system
 f. Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, veteran owned, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). All contractors must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp .

This Sources Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposal and at this time, no solicitation exists.

Introduction:   The Agency’s mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects. This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements. The Agency’s Comptroller’s Office requirements are equally diverse and unique.  DTRA is seeking interested sources capable of providing support to the DTRA Comptroller’s Office in accomplishing it responsibilities for the overall preparation, execution and management of the Agency’s resource portfolio.

Background:   The Comptroller’s Office, Business Enterprise, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), responsibilities are accomplished through two Comptroller organizational entities, the Program and Budget Division and the Finance and Accounting Division.  

The Program and Budget Division is responsible for, and provides oversight of, the Agency program and budget development, formulation, execution, and manpower resource requirements.  The Division provides primary DTRA program/budget interface/liaison with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) on program, budget, and execution issues, and is responsible for justifying and defending resource requests at Department of Defense (DoD), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Congressional staff budget hearings as directed.  The Program and Budget Division is also responsible for implementing the Agency’s corporate program review process to assure DTRA’s programmatic needs are adequately provided for and resources allocated in accordance with strategic priorities.  In this capacity, the Division is responsible for preparing, consolidating, and submitting reports, memorandums, information papers, and budget briefings to the Agency’s senior leadership for presentation to OUSD(C), DoD, OMB, Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress, as required, to defend the Agency’s budget.

These functions include:  Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance and financial reporting; Managers’ Internal Control Program; management and funds control programs; accounts payable; accounts receivable; accounts maintenance; and reconciliation.  In addition, the Division provides centralized management, administration, and operation of all DTRA card programs in support of DTRA requirements world-wide.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:

•	Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;
•	Providing grants to state and local government to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs; and
•	Marketing and promoting safety materials to various audiences and planning/executing social and consumer marketing campaigns aimed at raising awareness and influencing positive traffic safety behaviors.

Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belt use and preventing impaired driving will have the most significant impact on meeting NHTSA’s core mission and have, thus, become two of the agency’s priority programs.

It is estimated that increasing safety belt use can reduce fatalities by up to 45% in passenger cars and 60% in light trucks.  Every increase in safety belt use translates to lives saved and injuries prevented.  NHTSA estimates that every one percentage-point increase represents 2.8 million more Americans buckling up, 250 additional lives saved, and 4,000 fewer serious injuries annually.

Impaired driving-related deaths account for nearly 42 percent of all traffic fatalities annually.  Driving impaired is one of the most often committed crimes in America, affecting 1 in 3 Americans annually, resulting in 1 fatality (one driver has BAC = .08) every 39 minutes, 37 deaths every day, more than 16,000 fatalities annually and 167 DUI arrests every hour.

Currently, NHTSA’s communications efforts primarily focus on conducting highly visible traffic enforcement of safety belt and impaired driving prevention laws, as research has demonstrated clearly that this approach has an immediate and sustainable impact on knowledge, awareness, and influencing positive behavior.  The communications “model” consists of earned media, paid media, and high visibility enforcement to change behavior.  All media focuses on the stepped up enforcement activities taking place.

The contractor shall perform the tasks as follows:

Task 1.  Kickoff Meetings

The contractor shall participate with NHTSA Headquarters and the Region in a meeting (in person or via conference call) to outline national media efforts and how the Region and States can support the national effort.  The contractor will review the National Communications Plan and Calendar and apply appropriately to the Regions communications efforts.  

Additionally, the contractor shall attend an initial strategy meeting at the New England Region Office to review NHTSA’s traffic safety priorities, campaigns, programs, issues and sensitivities, and how those issues and efforts have been applied regionally, by the States, and by local political subdivisions with previous activities conducted by the Regional Office and State Highway Safety Offices.  Whenever possible, relevant existing research and background information will be provided to the contractor.  Missing, needed information will be identified and assignments for gathering such information will be clearly assigned.  Tasks, milestones and deliverables will be discussed and issues clearly resolved.  This meeting will be held within one month of the contract award.

Task 2.  Develop a Year-Round, Multi-Media Regional/State Communications Plan

The intent of the National communications plan is to develop a series of year-round integrated marketing communications activities that build upon, leverage and maximize the impact of our two preexisting major enforcement and advertising campaigns. The contractor will develop a Regional communication plan and provide support, as appropriate, to states in their plan development. The contractor will design a year-round calendar for Regional activities modeled after the National Communications Plan to reach the identified targeted segments/audience with the appropriate messages not only during the Mobilization and Crackdown but also at every identified point of opportunity within the calendar year.  

Task 3.  Plan and Conduct Media Events (Earned Media)

In support of the Regional Communications Plan, the contractor will provide direct technical assistance and consultation to the NHTSA Regional Office to include, but not be limited to:
•	Plan and conduct news conferences, to include news releases and presentations and collaboration with partners to increase media support;
•	Generate broadcast and print media beyond events, to include Satellite Media Tours, Audio News Releases, Video Soundbites and B-roll, Radio Media Tours, appearances on local TV and radio news and talks shows, editorial boards, op-ed and letters to the editor, issue specific articles targeted to national and local press publications;
•	Develop a media “crisis plan” for dealing with unforeseeable contingencies that might adversely affect public acceptance of traffic safety messages.

Task 4.  Collaboration and Partnership Opportunities

At the direction of the Region, the contractor will be required to foster and develop corporate and media partnerships to promote Click It or Ticket and the DRUNK DRIVING OVER THE LIMIT. UNDER ARREST., and social norming traffic safety messages throughout the year.  Through the implementation of the Regional Communications Plan and proactive media outreach, the contractor will work with the Region to strengthen relationships with existing partners and develop new partners within the media, law enforcement community, education, health care, and others as directed by the Region to pro-actively support, educate and promote occupant protection and impaired driving prevention messages and initiatives.
Suggested partnerships include but are not limited to:

Health Care Professionals - Doctors, nurses, and other medical, emergency, and health care professionals who add their unique perspective to the problem.

Law Enforcement Officers and Officials - Law enforcement leadership must encourage and be supportive of officers enforcing traffic safety laws. The public must be supportive of law enforcement officers.   The public must be made keenly aware of enforcement mobilizations and traffic safety laws and the consequences of breaking those laws.

The Judicial System – Prosecutors, judges, probation departments and others in the judicial system have another unique perspective on traffic offenders.  The entire judicial system needs to work in a coherent, systemic and united fashion in order to decrease impaired driving and increase occupant protection use.

Business – Loss of an employee or employees’ time due to traffic crashes is a huge employer economic burden.  Medium and large employers should be fed articles and information for employee wellness and safety programs and for house publications.

Crash Victims and Survivors - those who have escaped serious injury or death or those who have lost quality of life or loved ones as a result of traffic crashes.

Cultural/Ethnic Organizations - to provide assistance in outreach activities (media/materials) to assure messages reach as many diverse groups as practically possible.  

Task 5.  Generate Media, as appropriate, for other highway safety issues

The contractor shall work, at the direction of the Regional Office, to develop publicity, events, interviews and/or other activities and channels for emerging highway safety issues beyond safety belts and impaired driving. The contractor will work with the Regions to develop and implement the most appropriate communication strategy and tactics to generate news coverage on emerging hot topics. 

The contractor shall establish and maintain contact with the major print and broadcast media providers in the major media markets of the New England Region including key media in each of the six Sates in the Region.  The New England Region Office and its States will be positioned as a source of commentary on safety belts, air bags, impaired driving, child safety seats, booster seats and other appropriate highway safety topics.  The contractor shall maintain, at a minimum, bi-monthly contact with the major print and broadcast media providers in the major media markets of the New England Region providing newsworthy releases or pitching stories about impaired driving prevention, safety belts, child safety seats, booster seats and other highway safety topics.  The New England Region staff and the contractor will work together to develop these products or pitches.

The contractor shall have the ability and demonstrated experience to advise the Regional Office and State Highway Safety Offices on issues relating to paid media, including the development of ads, targeting appropriate audiences, identifying the most strategic media venues, purchasing time or space, negotiating the buys and other issues relating to paid media.

Task 6.  Training

The contractor shall have the ability to deliver media skills training to the staff of the Regional Office, State Highway Safety Offices and other partners to assure uniform messaging of all national efforts.

Task 7.  Materials 

The contractor will prepare draft copy and/or graphic layouts, in cooperation with the NHTSA Headquarters and the Regional Office, for broadcast or print media outlets.  This preparation will also include developing strategies to deliver the materials to the targeted audiences and media outlets, and identifying avenues for media support.  

On a limited basis, the contractor could provide for copying services for materials to be presented at mobilization and other press events, meetings and trainings.

Task 8

The contractor shall provide a quarterly report of activities performed under this contract to the COTR at the NHTSA New England Regional Office following the award of this contract.  This report will be of a narrative format and contain information on contacts and accomplishments made during the previous reporting period, plan and schedules for the remaining period of the contract and examples of any materials produced.

<DESC>PROPOSED REQUIREMENT TITLE:

HHS-BARDA-Sources Sought Egg Supply-Dec 2008: Continuous Supply of Embryonated Eggs and Clinical Batch Production for National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Efforts 

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.

This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government (USG). The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.  The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) has a future requirement to support the program’s mission of A Nation Prepared to rapidly respond and produce a strain-matched pandemic influenza vaccine in the event of a declared pandemic.  Assuring this early availability of a sufficient quantity of vaccine for the U.S. population in the setting of a pandemic will potentially prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars.   In 2004, the USG awarded a sole source contract to normalize the supply of embryonated eggs throughout the year and stockpile other critical materials for rapid pandemic influenza vaccine production, if required.  This contract also supported work to produce small clinical lots of inter-pandemic influenza vaccine for potential clinical testing.  This contract is to expire in September 2009.  The purpose of this SSN is to identify potential sources (large or small businesses) that may be capable of performing this new revised requirement.  This proposed requirement would support these services as well as reagent production and management of potential clinical testing programs.  Therefore, this new requirement would be a continuation of the existing requirements with a broadening of the scope of work (SOW) to incorporate materials and activities newly identified as essential to the mission of assuring the expedient supply of strain-matched influenza vaccine to the U.S. population during a pandemic.  Specifically, the USG contemplates a requirement that includes the following services:   1.  Maintain a continuous (year-round) domestic-based supply of embryonated eggs commensurate with the output of identified domestic-based commercial scale influenza manufacturing capabilities for the rapid production of matched-strain, monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, if required by the USG.  USG contemplates the pricing by a potential offeror will be on an eggs per production day basis.  The price will incorporate costs for overall flock management to supply the necessary laying hens to support daily egg production targets that match the current commercial scale capabilities on a continuous basis.  In addition, the price will incorporate the maintenance of a +20 percent egg production contingency (not to exceed 90,000 eggs per production day).   USG will support the costs of eggs produced and not used by commercial manufacturing activities.   2.  Manufacture, formulate, characterize, fill and finish 3,000 investigational doses of monovalent inter-pandemic influenza vaccine (at pilot manufacturing scale).  Strain selection will be at the direction of HHS.  3.  Manage to completion Phase 1 -or- Phase 1/2 clinical studies of investigation monovalent inter-pandemic influenza vaccine candidates.  Pricing to include all costs associated with necessary regulatory filings (i.e. IND).  4.  Create/ produce one (1) or two (2) reference strain reagents each year for shipment to FDA/CBER for appropriate calibration testing.  Pricing to include all necessary lab work required to establish a reference strain per regulatory guidelines.  Pricing to include the appropriate storage costs to maintain a reference strain library in which the contents are accessible to and retrievable by HHS upon request.  To be evaluated and considered for award of this requirement, a potential offeror must meet the following mandatory criteria for eligibility:  1.  The potential offeror shall demonstrate they currently maintain and have unlimited access to a U.S. based, FDA licensed, cGMP manufacturing facility that is currently, or has recently, been engaged with egg-based influenza vaccine production at commercial scale.  2.  The potential offeror shall demonstrate they currently maintain and have access to a FDA licensed, cGMP pilot scale manufacturing facility that is capable of egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine production.  3.  The potential offeror shall demonstrate they possess the appropriate facilities and skills to produce, calibrate and maintain reference strain-specific reagents for influenza antigens.  4.  The potential offeror shall provide proof that their facility(s) and subcomponent contractors/ suppliers/ vendors have pandemic influenza plans in place to ensure USG contracts will be honored during a pandemic influenza outbreak.  It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced approximately late February 2009 with proposals due in April 2009. While the mandatory criteria for eligibility do not have to currently be met for this sources sought notice, all of the mandatory qualification criteria shall be met by proposal submission.   It is requested that respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting the following information:   1.  An anticipated delivery schedule of the services outlined in the contemplated by the USG in the scope of work (SOW) outlined above.  2.  A brief capability statement, including how a potential offeror plans to meet the mandatory criteria for eligibility outlined above.  3.  Primary contact information at the organization (name, email, address and telephone number) handling this sources sought notice, in the event HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information.   Responses are limited to fifteen (15) pages. Data sets (i.e., tables, charts, graphs) and documents that are pertinent to the response can be submitted in excess of the fifteen (15) pages, as appendices to the primary submission.  Potential respondents are also requested to include whether or not they are a large or small business.  Small businesses are highly encouraged to respond.  All respondents and comments to this sources sought notice shall reference HHS-BARDA Sources Sought-Egg Supply-Dec 2008 and be submitted to Kyle Roberts, Contract Specialist, at kyle.roberts@hhs.gov by 2:00 PM EST, January 12, 2009.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH SYNOPSIS

The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying the ability of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to act as a concept demonstrator providing ground resupply as part of a live force experiment.  This experiment will address resupply of small units by providing an unmanned vehicle that operates as part of the experiment force that may be procured in the near future. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirement. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable ! commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research synopsis. Information on capable sources is sought for the follow requirements: 
1.1	Background.  In today's modern battle spaces, potential enemies understand the strengths of U.S. Military forces and seek to capitalize on asymmetric means to defeat them.  Small unit leaders will continue to enter complex hostile environments in order to accomplish high risk missions.  Marine tactical units need a sustainment capability to conduct these missions.  A live force experiment will be conducted in June 2009 in order to collect data leading to an assessment of the potential UGV to support this concept.  Additionally, this experiment will investigate the possibility of using an UGV system for limited Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). 
2.0	OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION.  The employment of the UGVs in this experiment will enable MCWL to recommend future logistics related programs pursuant to achievement of the capabilities required to enable the enhanced company operation (ECO) concept. The experiment will further serve to examine potential Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for employing a UGV. 
	2.1	Location.  The UGV will be employed in two locations.  The first location will be a facility determined by the contractor for a period not to exceed five (5) working days in accordance with task 3.1.1. The second location will be at the Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC), Bridgeport, CA and/or Army Ammunition Depot Hawthorne, NV for a period of ten (10) days in accordance with task 3.1.6. 
	2.2	Scenarios.  The experiment design consists of a series of scenarios during which the UGV will move with squad, platoon, and company sized units to simulate logistics support and ground CASEVAC for small simulated ECO units.  These scenarios will stimulate the UGVs to execute specific behaviors.  
		2.2.1	Maneuverability - The UGV's ability to follow foot mobile personnel over terrain including improved and unimproved roads and limited cross country should be equivalent to a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request of Interest for Technetium-99 In-Situ Vadose Zone Detector</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br /></strong>Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) as a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking businesses to provide an in-situ vadose zone technetium-99 detector to be used with a hydraulically-driven direct push unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />WRPS is characterizing subsurface plumes in and around tank farms at the Hanford Site in south central Washington. One of the techniques is to push down a hollow rod of 1.75 inches (inner diameter) and a bottom opening diameter of just over 1 inch. At selected depths, the inner rod (which is used to drive the rod) is withdrawn and a sampling unit is deployed. The sampling unit is withdrawn and the inner rod is reinserted to drive to a new depth. After the final sample (up to 300 feet below ground surface) is collected, the outer rod is withdrawn and the probehole is decommissioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />We desire a detector that can quantify the concentration of technetium-99 (at levels from &lt;10 pCi/g of soil to 1,000 pCi/g of soil) either at selected depths just before or after sampling or continuously during decommissioning of the probehole. The deployed detector may be subjected to gamma radiation fields created by up to 108 pCi/g of cesium-137, but would not have to operate during that interval. Natural beta/gamma radiation background gamma levels come from potassium-40 at levels of 10 to 40 pCi/g. Natural alpha radiation background comes from uranium and thorium at levels of 1-3 pCi/g. Technetium-99 is the major beta emitter in the contamination plume for the depths of interest.<br />The initial tasks are the creation of a development plan and the testing of the prototype detector in a laboratory of our choosing using split spoon samples retrieved from previous characterization efforts. The chosen vendor is not responsible for the laboratory testing, but will provide on-site consulting during the laboratory testing. The target dates for the laboratory testing are June 1 up to June 30, 2009. At the option of WRPS, the unit would be deployed in the direct push unit as part of one or more field tests. Finally, WRPS would at its option purchase such detectors for its use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />Interested firms are invited to submit an expression of interest letter to include a response to the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. A description of their system/technical approach.<br />2. A preliminary drawing/sketch of their concept.<br />3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for all components.<br />4. A ROM schedule and any qualifying conditions for meeting the schedule.<br />5. A brief description of Quality Program.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is not a Request for Proposal, but a request for an expression of interest. Expression of interest letters must be received via email at Alice_R_Hendrickson@rl.gov or by fax at (509) 373-2551 no later January 7, 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />WRPS looks forward to hearing from you regarding this request.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Alice Hendrickson<br />Procurement Specialist</p>

<DESC><p>This is not a solicitation, but a Notice of Contract Action. The United States Air Force (USAF), Holloman Air Force Base, 49th Contracting Squadron, intends to award a single source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order to Cooper Crouse-Hinds. The Airfield Lighting Control System (ALCS) requires maintenance and repairs. IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), it has been determined, due to duplications of cost associated with an award to a contractor other than Cooper Crouse-Hinds, this will be a sole source acquisition awarded to Cooper Crouse-Hinds. If the government awarded to a new contractor, the new contractor would have to replace all existing ALCS equipment with their own equipment, which would cost substantially more money than the proposed contract. The previous award was to Transtech Airport Solutions, who is in dissolution and whose proprietary equipment has been acquired by Cooper Crouse-Hinds. The sole source award is based on proprietary information and technology exclusive to Cooper Crouse-Hinds. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) persuant to FAR <br />6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), awarding the contract to any other source would cause duplication of costs due to the need for any contractor other than Cooper Crouse-Hinds having to remove all of the old equipment previously installed and then install their own equipment. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, not later than 8 December 2008, referencing F2E3CR8170A001, to A1C Kanon Morris, Contract Administrator, kanon.morris@holloman.af.mil. The government will review all responses, without prejudice, and determine if another firm is capable of fulfulling the Airfield Lighting Control System requirement.</p>

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for the Non-Traditional Active Sonar program with the objective to demonstrate signal and information processing using data collected in two planned at-sea data collections.

The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.

<DESC>Amendment 1 corrects the EXPRESS web site link and adds contact information<BR>********<BR>The U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) announces an open season to restructure existing teams for all domains under the Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) program.  EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel).  These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support.  The complete scope of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed below.  Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the EXPRESS domains as follows:  Business & Analytical  3 each, Logistics  3 each, Programmatic  4 each, and Technical  6 each.  The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams.  The purpose of the current open season will allow the existing EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders to restructure existing teams by adding new team members and subcontractors, deleting current team members and subcontractors, changing current subcontractors to team members, changing current team members to subcontractors, and/or revising teaming arrangement(s) to respond to future EXPRESS task order requirements.  Parties interested in participating as a team member (GSA Schedule required), subcontractor (no GSA Schedule required) or providing incidental materials (GSA Schedule preferred), are encouraged to pursue appropriate arrangements with the current EXPRESS Prime Contractor/Team Leaders.  A list of the current EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders may be found on the EXPRESS website located at https://ams8.redstone.army.mil/acweb/acwebdba.acweb_systems_public2?p_system_id=1&p_link_id=83.    This website also contains a link to each BPA teams website for additional information.  To restructure teaming relationships on existing BPAs, Prime Contractors/Team Leaders are required to submit one hard copy and one CD-ROM containing the following information:  A team matrix that identifies added/deleted team members/subcontractors; a revised Attachment 4 (Team File) to include rates through 2014; and an updated RFQ Attachment 9 (Performance Capability Team File).  The format for the Team matrix will be provided via email.  Formats for Attachments 4 and 9 can be found on the EXPRESS website under the Open Season link.  Responses from the current prime/team leaders to this open season announcement are due no later than 1400  (CST) on 8 January 2009 to the following address:  COMMANDER, U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSCC-AVM-OS-O/Terri Adams, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.

BACKGROUND:	

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) provides global leadership through research, training, and education to enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.  Because of the increasing global burden of non-communicable chronic diseases noted in the seminal article in Nature (vol 450, November 22, 2007), the Institute plans to launch a Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) with a core group of six public research funding agencies in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, and India.  This will involve two phases:  Phase I entails the development of founding principles and documentation in collaboration with participating organizations, and Phase II entails the development of final plans and communications to launch the alliance.  This procurement encompasses Phase I.

SCOPE OF WORK:

Under the guidance of the NHLBI, the Contractor shall work with a core steering group of members from the United States (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH), United Kingdom, and Canada to complete Phase I preparations for the launch of the GACD.  This work involves the following tasks in order of initiation.

a.  Kick-off and initial draft of Framework Document and Business Plan – finalize the project approach; prepare and conduct the kick-off meeting with the four core members; research and draft the initial versions of the Framework Document and Business Plan; conduct the first progress meeting; and revise the draft documents accordingly.  
 
b.  Consultations with core group and consultation draft of Framework Document and Business Plan – prepare and conduct visits with research leaders; complete the consultation version of the draft documents; conduct the second progress review meeting; and revise the draft documents accordingly.

c.  Founding Meeting – plan and conduct a founding meeting with the four core members in London and summarize the meeting outcomes and next steps. 

The sole source determination is based upon Dalberg’s strong knowledge of the key institutions in the global health architecture.  Dalberg is uniquely qualified to plan the launch for the GACD.  Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm specializing in international development and globalization issues, has worked with leading international agencies, companies, foundations, and non-profit organizations in developing and emerging countries and has extensive experience and expertise in developing and building international coalitions and implementing initiatives in the unique environment of all regions of the world.  This includes work in setting strategic and organizational directions for global health initiatives and defining implementation parameters to carry out such efforts.

<DESC>This BAA solicitation for Rapid HIV point-of-care Diagnostic Device for resource-limited settings (hereinafter referred to as rapid virus test) seeks to fund a consortium of scientists with a breadth of complementary skills and expertise in clinical HIV research, the associated molecular technology, diagnostics, validation testing, GMP manufacturing and project management to develop a simple to use, rapid, point-of-care (POC) HIV diagnostic devices with candidate vaccine constructs and developed vaccine-induced antibodies in the absence of true HIV-1 infections and HIVinfected infants. The diagnostic technology must demonstrate feasibility for use in resource-limited settings and in POC clinics without the use of supporting laboratory equipment such as centrifuges, vortexes or pipettes. In addition, if proposed testing requires processing of patient samples for downstream applications, the processing must be selfcontained and require limited sample manipulation and safe containment of potentially infectious material. The output should be in a visual format, without ambiguity, and include a full process negative and internal positive control. It is anticipated that 1 to 2 cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded on August 3, 2009 for a period
of up to five years for the base period and options in years 3 and 4 for additional services; studies for a similar device to make limited treatment decisions based on viral load.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
NIDA CLINICAL DSMB ASSESSMENT
Services to be Performed:Provide residential research inpatient beds to individuals participating in NIDA approved clinical studies.  These inpatient beds would be provided on an as-needed basis, dictated by study protocol, to fulfill one or more of the following requirements:1.	Convenience of the individual participating in an early morning study procedure.
2.	An individual participating in a protocol that required consecutive nights accommodations.
3.	An individual participating in a protocol requiring clinical monitoring after completion of a study session.
Nursing services will be included as part of the inpatient bed coverage.  At times, specialized nursing services may be required for those individuals participating in protocols that require consecutive nights accommodations. Specialized nursing services will include:1.	Administration of research drugs and/or medications as dictated by NIDA approved study procedures.
2.	Collection, processing and storage of biological specimens.  Proper storage container (including refrigeration) will be provided by the Government.  Collection of neuropsychological and other forms of behavioral assessments as defined by the research study design.
3.	Some NIDA protocols require that participant vital signs be recorded around the clock during the period they are housed on the residential unit. Contractor nursing staff will be required to record this information directly into a Government provided computer terminal equipped with NIDA Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) software.  The Government will provide Contractor staff with training in the use of this software.
The vast majority of NIDA study interventions, procedure and study sessions are conducted at the NIDA Intramural Research Program located at 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland  21224.  Due to the needs of the program, the Contractor facility must be in close proximity to the NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program.  This proximity should allow NIDA IRP research staff to walk with the research participant to/from the overnight/inpatient facility to the NIDA IRP research facility and afford maximal participant safety and monitoring.
It is optimal that the facility allows NIDA IRP contractual research staff to perform limited study interventions or measures to study participants while housed on the in-patient facility.
The Contractors shall be able to demonstrate considerable experience in maintaining a residential research unit.  Infrastructure and physical plant must be suitable to deliver services in a manner that ensures both comfort and safety of the research participant.  Professional staff must have the necessary protocols.  Training for physicians and other care providers must be appropriate to care for patients and research control volunteers in clinical protocols.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a fixed-price purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) using FAR Part 13.

Quotes in response to this solicitation are due no later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time on Thursday, December 11, 2008, and must be submitted electronically via e-mail to both Mr. Robert Marosz, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone: 631-323-3397) at robert.marosz@dhs.gov and Ms. Courtney Byrd, Contract Officer, (Telephone: 631-323-3201) at coutney.byrd@dhs.gov. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: technical capability offered to meet the Government requirement; past performance; and price. The successful Offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing electronically via e-mail to both of the individuals listed above no later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Tuesday, December 9, 2008.

For this full and open competition, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) License B and/or Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Offeror’s facilities is required.

In order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a closed herd without having come from auction or having co-mingled with other cattle after November 1, 2008. Furthermore, the cattle shall be accumulated together for at least seven (7) calendar days prior to departure for Plum Island.  

The Offeror shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary.  The veterinary examination also will verify that each head of cattle has been given the appropriate antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Offeror, each animal must be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Offeror shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum:

•	general information identifying the animal by number/ID;
•	the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island;
•	breed;
•	gender;
•	age or birth date range;
•	date (de)horned, weaned, and castrated (if applicable);
•	the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic (Ivermectin), anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs;
•	any other tests and corresponding results;
•	and any other interesting and important information.

The Offeror must send these health papers, reports, and certificates via e-mail to the DHS PIADC points of contact listed above no later than seven (7) calendar days prior to departure for Orient Point.

Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

•	Holsteins;
•	castrated males;
•	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
•	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
•	polled or dehorned;
•	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
•	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last 90 calendar days (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

•	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e. pink) tongues;
•	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
•	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

Following notification of award, the Offeror (referred to after award as the “Supplier”) shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle and signed/official hardcopies of all corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, January 8, 2009.  

The Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals are not overly stressed and fatigued, namely as a result of prolonged transportation (for instance, not greater than 450 miles), which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Transportation of these animals includes, but is not limited to the primary enclosures to be used during the transportation of live animals, food and water requirements, care in transit, terminal facilities, and handling – in particular, shelter from cold weather, and shall be in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations (see http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm) with an emphasis on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9, Chapter 1, Subchapter A - Animal Welfare:  Part 3 Standards.

For this specific order, during this winter season, as described in Section 3.142 (3):

“Shelter from Cold Weather.  Transporting devices shall be covered to provide protection for live animals when the outdoor air temperature falls below 10°C. (50°F.) and such live animals shall not be subjected to surrounding air temperatures which fall below 7.2°C.  (45°F.), and which shall be measured and read in the manner prescribed in § 3.141 of this part, for a period of more than 45 minutes unless such animals are accompanied by a certificate of acclimation to lower temperatures as prescribed in § 3.136(c).”

Upon arrival on January 8, 2009, utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.  In the event that more that one vehicle is needed for the transportation of these 50 head of cattle, the Supplier must inform the DHS PIADC points of contact listed above in advance.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle or the monetary amount of cattle including a prorated monetary amount of health papers and transportation for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

The requirements of this solicitation are issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

Services anticipated to begin February 21, 2009.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firing range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range must be within a 20-mile radius of the Field Office located in Edina, Minnesota.

The range must be established range.  This RFP is not a request to build a range.
The proposed range must meet various standards to qualify.  The contractor must make the range available exclusively to DHS; it must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours, and designated training staff must be granted 24-hour unimpeded access to the range facilities.  Because of the unique weather patterns specific to Minnesota, the range may be indoors or outdoors during the summer months and exclusively indoors during the winter, early spring and late fall months.  The range must possess a minimum of five (5) firing points.  The range must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess a public address system available during firearms training.  The range must possess movable barricades for the 25-yard and 15-yard course of fire.  The range must possess some type of classroom facility with chalkboard or maker board.  The range must be able to accommodate all handgun calibers.  The range must have reduced-light or no-light firing capabilities.  The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).  The range cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e. tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).  The range cannot disallow the shooting of DHS/TSA/FAMS approved steel targets, provided frangible ammunition is used and the shooter is at least 15 yards away from the steel targets.  The range rules must allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic fire drills.  The range must possess a storage area dedicated to DHS use that would allow storage of up to 5000 rounds of ammunition and 150 cardboard target backers.  Indoor ranges must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.  The range must have a dedicated weapon cleaning room and suitable waste disposal bins/equipment available for use by DHS employees.  The range must have means to discard expended cartridges.  The estimated days of range usage are 260 per year at approximately four (4) hours per day.  The estimated number of rounds fired per quarter is 60,000 rounds.  Pricing must be submitted at the hourly usage rate.

Evaluation Criteria:  The following are the evaluation criteria for each factor and any sub-factors under that factor.  A.  Technical and past performance when combined are more important than price.  B.  Technical Factor is more important than Past Performance.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate Offers:  Technical Capability, Price and Past Performance.   Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Definitions are as follows:  ACCEPTABLE:  To be rated acceptable, the offerors technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements. UNACCEPTABLE:  A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements of the Salient Characteristics will be determined unacceptable.  Past Performance will be evaluated as high risk, medium risk and low risk with definitions as follows:  Unsatisfactory / High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records under the various factor evaluations, or offerors record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms. -Satisfactory / Moderate Risk - Some doubt exists based on instances of record of poor performance, especially in contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. Good / Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's preponderance of good, if not excellent past and current records of contract performance, especially in large contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.   Neutral Risk   No relevant past performance Information.   PRICE:  Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability.  Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer.  <BR> The Government reserves the right to award to other than the low offeror for better technical capability and/or better performance records.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<a href="mailto:Kristina.Kolodziej@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>This is a SOLE SOURCE combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.The solicitation number is VA-776-09-RQ-0006 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR 13.1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-29.  This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business; the associated NAICS code is 541512 and the small business size standard is $25 million.All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to award a SOLE SOURCE contract to VisionShare, Inc., using the authority at FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, for the services described in the statement of work below.SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a need to receive data from Trailblazer Health Enterprises, the fiscal intermediary for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in order to process claims accurately for veterans that are eligible for both VA and Medicare benefits.  Market research revealed that only two vendors, VisionShare, Inc., and IVANS, are authorized by CMS for Internet-based connectivity with the Medicare fiscal intermediary, Trailblazer Health Enterprises. The VA's Information Technology infrastructure and associated disaster recovery policies discourage leased lines/frame relay connections with external data trading partners.  A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the VA's preferred method for obtaining external data. Furthermore, the VA's information security policy discourages installing commercial software on VA systems, if possible, in order to limit vulnerabilities and additional time and money required for system certification and accreditation.  Thus, the VA needs the vendor to host the data transfer services at the vendor site.  Additional market research revealed that VisionShare is the only authorized CMS vendor that can transmit the data from Trailblazer to VA via a VPN.  IVANS does not offer data exchange services that can transmit the data from TrailBlazer to VA via VPN.  IVANS is also unable to host the data transfer services and would require the VA to install its software on VA systems.  As a result, the VA determined that IVANS cannot satisfy VA requirements, necessitating a negotiated sole source contract with Visionshare.STATEMENT OF WORK FOR SECURE EXCHANGE SERVICES FOR MEDICARE DATAPURPOSE: The purpose of this contract is for the Department of Veterans Affairs to obtain Medicare patient deductible and co-insurance amounts related to non-VA health care to ensure billing accuracy and prevent claim denials.  BACKGROUND: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Chief Business Office (CBO) has established several initiatives to comply with legislative mandates put in place by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). One such initiative is the electronic Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (e-MRA) initiative. Unlike the commercial health insurance companies, VHA is not permitted to bill Medicare and does not receive reimbursement from Medicare for VA healthcare services provided to veterans.  However, VHA is permitted to recover costs associated with treatment of patients non-service-connected conditions from insurance companies in situations where veterans have secondary insurance to supplement the primary coverage provided by Medicare.  In order to determine the appropriate amount of reimbursement due to VHA, the secondary insurance companies require adjudication information from Medicare.  The purpose of the e-MRA initiative is to obtain the adjudication information that would be generated if VA were permitted to bill and receive reimbursement from Medicare.  The VA acquires this adjudication information through Trailblazer Health Enterprises, LLC, the fiscal intermediary under contract to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  Trailblazer processes these Medicare claim transactions from VA Medical Centers and renders a Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice.  Emdeon is the VA-contracted healthcare clearinghouse used in these electronic data exchanges between VA and TrailBlazer.  The VA Austin Information Technology Center hosts the e-MRA application and manages the communications between Emdeon and VA.When a patient receives care from VA and non-VA sources, problems with proper adjudication of the healthcare claim arise, which can result in denied claims or inaccurate billing to the patient. This is the consequence of VA not billing Medicare.  This problem can be alleviated if TrailBlazer provides the VA with Medicare patient deductible and co-insurance amounts related to non-VA health care. This information is essential to optimizing VHA billing and recovery efforts. CMS has agreed to provide the data using TrailBlazer-initiated data transfers (also known as unsolicited response transactions). SCOPE: Provide secure data transport services between TrailBlazer Health Enterprises and VA using CMS-approved, commercially available Internet-based connection services that enable the VA to obtain TrailBlazer-initiated Unsolicited Response transactions and provide fail-over connectivity between TrailBlazer and VA should the Emdeon connectivity be disrupted.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award.PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Contractor site.TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:TASK ONE - ESTABLISH ENTRY POINT: The contractor shall provide the entry point into the TrailBlazer Health Enterprises processing system within twenty-one (21) business days after award.  If the VPN between VA and VisionShare, which shall be established by the VA Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) is not available within this 21-day window, then the Contractor is required to establish the connection to TrailBlazer Health Enterprises within two (2) working days after the AITC enables the VPN connection.TASK TWO - SECURE DATA EXCHANGE SERVICE: The contractor shall provide a secure data transport service between VA and TrailBlazer Health Enterprises that is recognized by CMS as an authorized Internet-based commercially available connection.  The service shall comply with the following constraints: 1) The service shall not require VA to install vendor software within the VA environment; 2) The service shall enable VA/TrailBlazer data exchanges utilizing a VA/vendor VPN and secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as approved by the VA Office of Information and Technology Configuration Management Division and the Enterprise Security Configuration Control Board; 3) The service shall support unlimited transactions; 4) The service shall not entail development of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) transaction set translation or mapping processes, non-CMS or non-VA generated data or messages, or data reformatting; 5) The service shall conform to the information agreements to be established via an Interconnection Security Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding between the VA and the contractor.  The service shall also conform to a business associate agreement to be established between the VA and the contractor.  TASK THREE - MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT: The contractor shall support end-to-end communication testing, implementation and daily operations of the data transfers from TrailBlazer to VA;, which shall include, at a minimum:  1) The contractor shall provide routine technical support to implement corrections to service occurring as a result of errors, flaws or other failures within their service. 2) The Contractor shall notify a designated VA point of contact (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)) of any scheduled maintenance that shall result in downtime at least two (2) days prior to the maintenance period.  3) The contractor shall notify a designated VA point of contact of any issues at their facility or at TrailBlazer Health Enterprises that result in a disruption of data exchange capabilities.  This notification shall occur as soon as the disruption is identified.4) The contractor shall provide customer support for reporting, documenting, tracking and resolving of service problems, which shall be available via telephone and email to VA technical staff during the period 8:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m. Central Standard Time.TASK FOUR - BACK-UP SITE DATA RECOVERY SERVICE:  The Contractor shall provide VA/VPN connectivity with the AITC or the AITC backup site for the recovery of data transfers from the VA healthcare clearinghouse in the event of a connectivity disruption disaster. The VPN and the data transfers are expected to be operational within seventy-two (72) hours of the AITC declaring a disaster.   SOLICITATION PROVISIONS: The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999), applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>This amendment provides answers to questions regarding the solicitation from prospective offerors. The hour and date specified for receipt of proposals HAS NOT been extended. 
Offerors must acknowledge receipt of this Amendment by identifying this amendment number and date of the amendment on each copy of the offer submitted.  Failure to receive your acknowledgement may result in the rejection of your offer.  Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This amendment does not designate a suggested cut off date for the submittal of questions regarding this BAA.  However, if questions are received one week prior to the due date for the submission of proposals,  we cannot guarantee a response.  In addition, the proposal submission due date will not be extended.

Questions and Answers (numbering continued from Amendment #1)

 24.  Page 8, PART I, THE SCHEDULE, SECTION C, ARTICLE C.2., Reporting Requirements, paragraph a.5., requires that the source code be delivered at the completion of the project.  Some of the work that has gone into the development of the platform we propose to use was developed at our own expense.  Is it absolutely necessary that source code be delivered at the completion of the contract?

Response:  The BAA incorrectly specified that source code be delivered at the completion of the contract.  Therefore, SECTION C, ARTICLE C.2., Reporting Requirements, paragraph a.5., is deleted in its entirety.  Please note, however, that contractors must be willing to share the necessary documentation with the Government in order to prepare a pre-Investigation Device Exemption (IDE) and a Pre-market Approval (PMA) package for regulatory approval of the HIV POC diagnostic device.   

25.  ATTACHMENT 5, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, Table 1, would alternate power sources compatible with a resource limited setting be acceptable?

Response:  Yes, but the device must function as a POC diagnostic device in a resource limited setting.  

26.  ATTACHMENT 5, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, page 2, Table 1, issue: Cost.  We would propose an HIV test that will concurrently assess multiple independent gene targets.  The specification indicated a $12 - $20 range per result.  As our platform would provide multiple results concurrently is the cost per result ($12 -$20) or is it simply $12- $20 for all results.

Response:  We are focused on diagnosing HIV and therefore are unwilling to pay for the cost of unrelated tests.  

27.  ATTACHMENT 5, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, page 2, Table 1, issue: Full Set of Specifications.  If we cannot hit all specifications listed in Attachment 5, Research and Technical Objectives, Table 1, is it worth our continued interest in responding to the RFP?

Response:  The specifications listed in Table 1 are estimates provided to offerors to assist with proposal preparation.  They are not meant to be restrictive.  Therefore, Attachment 5, page 2, the paragraph preceding Table 1, Key Specifications and Ranges for a Rapid, HIV POC Diagnostic Device, is hereby revised to read as follows:

  “The specifications required for the diagnostic device to be successfully implemented in the field are summarized in Table 1.  These specifications are estimates provided to offerors to assist with proposal preparation and are not meant to be restrictive.”  

28.  Amendment 1, responses to questions 7 and 16, refer to a NIAID sponsored workshop entitled "Novel Technologies in Rapid HIV-1 Viral Detection" at NIH on July 12-13, 2007.  Is a transcript of the meeting  available?

Response:  A Summary Report of the meeting is attached.  Also, links to videocast’ of the two day meeting can be accessed via the following websites: 

Novel Technologies in Rapid HIV-1 Viral Detection (Day 1): 
http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=13930

Novel Technologies in Rapid HIV-1 Viral Detection (Day 2): 
http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=13932 

29.  Page 16, SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, ARTICLE H.3. HUMAN
     MATERIALS (ASSURANCE OF OHRP COMPLIANCE) speaks to a question about the exclusion of human subjects from this contract.  It was presumed that obtaining blood samples from HIV infected and non-infected individuals be permitted under this contract.....to your knowledge, is that correct?

Response:  The resulting contract is expected to obtain, receive, collect, store, modify or otherwise utilize human materials.  A properly completed “Protection of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB Certification/Declaration of Exemption”, Optional Form OMB No. 0990-0263 (or a self-designated form) certifying IRB review and approval of the protocol from which the human materials were obtained must be received from the contractor/subcontractor before research or collection involving human materials may be conducted under the contract.

30.  Page 4, SECTION B – SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COST, ARTICLE B.1. BRIEF 
        DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES, addresses NIAID’s intended target location for this device.  In other words, the question was posed as to whether this device is planned to be used more domestically or more in developing countries?

Response:  The diagnostic technology must demonstrate feasibility for use in resource-limited settings and In POC clinics without the use of supporting laboratory equipment such as centrifuges, vortexes or pipettes.

31.  One of our primary questions is related to the current state of completion that will be considered by the reviewers.  In short, will the reviewers prefer to select an existing technology that is currently in use in other market areas or is the preference for a new technology that addresses the specific needs of the solicitation, even though the new technology is not currently available for use? To put it even more simply, is the purpose of the solicitation to fund promising new technology to bring it to a state that can be commercialized or is the solicitation targeted for existing technology that can be modified to suit the requirements?

Response:  ATTACHMENT 5 TABLE 1, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, addresses how your response to the solicitation can be targeted at either new or a modification of existing technology providing it meets the  POC device specifications. The product development activities should include your plan to submit an IDE and subsequently a PMA package to FDA as listed in Attachment 5.  Your selection of a platform should plan on getting this accomplished in a 5 year time frame.

32.  Article I.2(c) “Authorized Substitution of Clauses” on page 25 states that “FAR Clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General (December 2007) is deleted in its entirety.”  However, Article I.3 (a) (8)-(10) 
  “Additional Contract Clauses” on page 26 states that “FAR Clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data – General (December 2007)” as well as Alternate IV and Alternate V are “incorporate[d] . . . by reference” into the contract.  Can you clarify whether FAR Clause 52.227-14 is incorporated in the contract?

Response: FAR Clause 52.227-14 is incorporated in the contract, as well as Alternate IV (JUN 1987) and Alternate V (JUN 1987).

33.  Article C.3 on page 3 makes reference to FAR Clause 52.227-11, Patent- Rights-Ownership by the Contractor.   This clause is also referenced in Article F.1 (pg.11) and on page 5 of Attachment 6.  However, Article I..3(a)(7) on page 26 states that “FAR Clause 52.227-13, “Patent  Rights-Ownership by the Government” is incorporate[d] …. by reference into the contract.  These two clauses are mutually exclusive, or at least in tension with one another.  Which clause do you intend to include?  The multiple references to 52.227-11       make it appear that this clause is the intended one, and it would also be our preference.

Response:  The Government is not interested in retaining possession of an invention, therefore FAR clause 52.227-13,” Patent Rights-Ownership by the Government” is not applicable and is hereby deleted from the Broad Agency Announcement.   However, FAR clause 52.227-11 is applicable” with respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor has acquired title, the Federal agency has the right to a  ” nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced each subject invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States (including any Government agency).”
 
34.  Page 8, issue:  Source code.  If the source code for the contractor’s instrument is proprietary and was developed at the organization’s expense, the contractor would not be willing to share this with the goverrment.  If a contractor is unwilling to share source is it worth their effort to respond to the RFP?

Response:  A stated in the response to question no. 24, Article C.2 (a) (5) on page 8 is deleted in its entirety.  Also, on page 4 of ATTACHMENT 6, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER DELIVERABLES, the paragraph titled “Source Code and Object Code” is deleted in its entirety.

35.  Is there a page limit?

Response:  The page limit for the technical proposal is 150 pages.  The specific details are found in Section J of the RFP, again in Attachment 1, page 2.

36.  Would NIH vaccine center provide clinical samples to test for vaccine efficacy testing by this POC test?  We have developed a prototype for sensitive ultra rapid test for HIV detection, which can be modified for testing vaccine efficacy.  Question is how do we test these devices for their usefulness of vaccine efficacy?

Response:  A mechanism for requesting archived specimens from previous vaccine trials is available at http://www.HVTN.org.  This information is stated in Attachment 5, Research and Technical Objectives, bottom of page 1.  The offeror should attempt to establish this collaboration and if this proposal is successful, the NIAID Program Staff will ensure that specimens are available through NIAID-sponsored network clinical trials. 

37.  It is unclear to me how it is possible to develop a human in vitro diagnostic test/device without performing Human Subject research?  Naturally all required FWA, IRB and other oversight would be obtained for all Institutions involved both domestic and international. Must the project really not include Human Subjects?  It would be impossible to develop a test without a component of the assessment involving human subjects.  Could you clarify this?

Response:  We anticipate that you will obtain or request archived human specimens from previous or ongoing human clinical trials to evaluate the diagnostic devise.  This solicitation does not have funds for the purpose of conducting a new clinical trial.  Is there a reasons that the proof-of concept, validation, and test-of-concept studies cannot be done with achieved specimens?  Because we anticipate that Offeror's will use existing specimens which are not individually identifiable from the original source, this research is not classified as human subjects research.

GENERAL STATEMENTS
The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued electronically and will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site at www.fbo.gov.
The construction effort to build the MILCON facility that will house the Research Altitude Chambers is already underway.  For this reason the Government makes no promise to have any changes made to the facility. However, your feedback is extremely valuable in assessing any potential impacts to system integration with the MILCON facility as a result of the facility constraints.  We understand that your specific designs are not complete and the results of this interchange of information are not contractually binding to any party.  As you provide responses we ask that you are as specific as possible (e.g., statements like In order to reduce risk of installation problems and testing of the completed system, an estimate is that the minimum exterior door size of ___ feet by ___ feet is required are preferred versus The door size may be too small.).
In addition to the facility constraints provided in the MILCON coordination document, there shall be no on-site external hydrostatic testing of the chambers nor is it allowable that a previously tested chamber be disassembled and re-assembled on-site because these options present unacceptable risk.  Please keep this additional constraint in mind in your planning efforts.
As time is of the essence, industry answers are requested by COB Wednesday, 12 Dec 08.

GENERAL STATEMENTS
The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued electronically and will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site at www.fbo.gov.
The construction effort to build the MILCON facility that will house the Research Altitude Chambers is already underway.  For this reason the Government makes no promise to have any changes made to the facility. However, your feedback is extremely valuable in assessing any potential impacts to system integration with the MILCON facility as a result of the facility constraints.  We understand that your specific designs are not complete and the results of this interchange of information are not contractually binding to any party.  As you provide responses we ask that you are as specific as possible (e.g., statements like In order to reduce risk of installation problems and testing of the completed system, an estimate is that the minimum exterior door size of ___ feet by ___ feet is required are preferred versus The door size may be too small.).
In addition to the facility constraints provided in the MILCON coordination document, there shall be no on-site external hydrostatic testing of the chambers nor is it allowable that a previously tested chamber be disassembled and re-assembled on-site because these options present unacceptable risk.  Please keep this additional constraint in mind in your planning efforts.

<DESC><p>5 Dec 2008 Update - Agenda and Registration for 16 Dec 2008 FFS/AR Industry Day and 16-17 Dec 2008 One-on-One Vendor Meetings</p>
<p>The Text below is posted as an attachement for ease of downloading, "FFS-AR Industry Day Official Notice_05 Dec 08".</p>
<p>Future updates, if any will be posted to this site.</p>
<p>Aeronautical Systems Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate (ASC/XR) in support of the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Aircraft Systems (AFPEO/AC) is hosting an Industry Day for the Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling (FFS/AR) Pilot Program directed by the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act on 16 December 2008. The event will be held from 8:00AM until 12:00PM (EST) in Dayton, OH at Foulois Hall in Building 146, in Area B, on Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.</p>
<p>This Industry Day is a market research tool to discuss the proposed Concept of Employment (CONEMP) for the Pilot Program as well as to determine the commercial availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any acquisition strategy. The Pilot Program shall be evaluated on its ability to support, augment or enhance the air refueling mission of the Air Force. The majority of the Air Force aerial refueling is accomplished utilizing a flying boom aerial refueling system; consequently, per the NDAA, boom aerial refueling will be the focus of this Industry Day and the Pilot Program.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will begin at 0800 in Foulois Hall on 16 December 2008. The morning will consist of three presentations as follows; Air Mobility Command will brief the CONEMP, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will brief certification requirements, and ASC/XR will brief the current program strategy, including results from the previous Request For Information (RFI). Industry will be offered the opportunity for individual visits with the Government team during the afternoon of 16 December and all of 17 December. Three visits will be scheduled for the afternoon of 16 December and the remaining visits will be held on 17 December. These vendor visits will be limited to one hour and will be scheduled upon request with first responders receiving preference of schedule. The vendor visits will be held in Conference Room 172 of Building 28/Area B at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH (maps will be furnished upon request). Questions for the one-on-one vendor meeting should be submitted in writing at the meeting. The AF may not be able to answer all questions during the vendor meeting. General questions will be answered in an update to the FBO Industry Day site.</p>
<p>Aerial refueling industry representatives interested in attending this event should contact Mr. John Doepker at (937) 656-5387 or John.Doepker@wpafb.af.mil no later than 10 December 2008. Each company will be limited to four participants (including any key partners). Request for a vendor visit must be made at the time of registration for the Industry Day. Mr. Doepker will compile an attendee list consisting of name, company, email address and phone number. This listing will be provided upon request to all attendees after Industry Day is completed.</p>
<p><br />Tentative Agenda (16 December 2008):<br />0800 Check-in<br />0820 Welcome and Administrative Comments.<br />0830 AMC/CONEMPS<br />0930 FAA/Certification<br />1030 Break<br />1045 ASC/XR - Previous RFI Results and Program Strategy<br />1145 Vacate Facility</p>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for RIA Quotation 
A.	General Information.  
 The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 44 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological.                 
Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFRIAQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product(s) or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare Network, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   

The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is March 2009.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil.    

B.	Products & Performance Required.  
The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $91,794.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period and includes the following top high volume usage lines for this project:

C.	Instructions to Vendors.  
DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil (202-782-3663).  All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT/EST on December 26, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  This process will include the above vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  Additionally, vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.             

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

Phase I – Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  
Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:  a. Based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  
2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  
3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:

1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  
	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam sterilization processes as follows:      
 
                  i.   Biological Indicators in self-contained vials with response/read-out times
                       of 3-hours (with controls and incubators).  

b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed above.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I.  
	c. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and meet current ANSO/AAMI standards for this product line.  Provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.          
      d. Vendors must provide information on the reliability, safety, and performance characteristics of their products including the interpretation of the Indicators results, the endpoint-response maintenance during storage, the sterilization conditions that the Indicators will detect, the shelf life of the Indicators., and the storage requirements for the Indicators themselves before and after sterilization (ANSI/AAMI ST79P 2006) with the initial submittal.  
	e. Vendors must provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions for testing, safety, and end-point values for all Indicators.  Provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions with the initial submittal.         
	f. Vendors must provide a statement indicating their products/packaging related to this product line is latex-safe/free with the initial submittal.  
      g. Vendors MUST provide specific product information (brand, model, cost, etc.) of proprietary incubator used for Biological Indicators and Controls in response to this RFRIAQ. 

2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in progress in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.    

3.  Vendors must provide documentation of agreement with the Northeast Region Prime Vendor (currently Owens & Minor) for distribution of Steam Sterilization Indicators-Biological with the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.  Vendors must provide documentation in response to this RFRIAQ.    

4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.    

5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for product implementation and customer servicing as required for the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) within the Northeast Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. 

6.  Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this standardization process.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this criteria.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this criterion.  

Phase II – Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process 
Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets—including no-cost controls, incubators, and pre-paid return shipping invoice for incubator equipment—and literature from the product group at no cost to the Government or POC recipient, to be sent to designated CPT members from participating MTFs for evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  In those instances where evaluation equipment (incubators) must be ordered through a specific military protocol /procedure with the vendor, the vendor MUST provide a representative who will coordinate and serve as vendor POC with the MTF POC for this protocol/procedure and no-cost evaluation equipment shipping/delivery and return with vendor pre-paid return shipping invoice.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cost product sample sets, etc., as specified above in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets, etc., to the designated CPT members.  NOTE:  Vendors will be required to notify the TRBO POC, by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets, etc., as specified above.    Requested no-cost sample sets, etc., as specified above, and literature must be shipped to arrive at the designated CPT member address no later than the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost sample sets.  Vendors who do not deliver the no-cost sample sets including no-cost controls, incubator, and pre-paid return shipping invoice to any or all shipping/delivery destinations by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets, etc., as specified above will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide a representative who will coordinate and serve as vendor POC with the MTF POC for the protocol/procedure and no-cost evaluation equipment (incubator) shipping/delivery and return as applicable will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative process.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO POC verification regarding the quantity, product descriptions, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and delivery receipt signature for no-cost sample sets in addition to the name of the vendor representative as specified above as appropriate.  Vendor’s presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. 

The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (sterile processing department) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)—Strongly Disagree; Two (2)—Disagree; Three (3)—Neutral; Four (4)—Agree; and Five (5)—Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   

The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative—at or near 3.50—depending on the location of any “break:” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  

Following the manufacturer’s instructions/guidelines, the evaluation of Biological Indicators will take place at each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department).  Evaluators will evaluate the performance of the Biological Indicators/Controls used in pack loads during five (5) sterilization process cycles using the following established Quality Control/Patient Safety category clinical/performance criteria:       
         
      1.   The Biological Indicator/Control product packaging clearly indicates the type of Indicator
            for which type of steam sterilization process.            
      a. Biological Steam Sterilization Indicators are required to be specific to the type of sterilization process.             
b. Evaluator will assess for the ease of determining the type of Biological Indicator by examining the product packaging.      
2.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the initial Biological Indicator response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle.        
	a. Biological Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle.      
	b. Before pack load is sterilized, the Biological Indicator is placed in pack load according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.
3.   After complete incubation with Control, the Biological Indicator and Control response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (No Growth of Biological Indicator/Growth of Control).    
      a. Biological Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle. Controls must clearly indicate growth of biological as a comparison.  
      b. After process cycle is completed and Biological Indicator has completed the required incubation period, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator/Control for ease of determining appropriate response (No Growth of Indicator/Growth of Control) indicating exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.                  

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  
1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region—represents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched products—and  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines—unmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor—reduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, are more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.    
2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria, are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and do meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any “break” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      
3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.
4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendor’s quotes should contain the vendor’s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  
The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   
5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.

Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFRIAQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product(s) or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare Network, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   

The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is March 2009.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil.    

B.	Products & Performance Required.  
The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Steam Sterilization Indicators - Chemical, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $73,014.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period and includes the following top high volume usage lines for this project:

C.	Instructions to Vendors.  
DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil (202-782-3663).  All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT/EST on December 26, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. 
This process will include the above vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  Additionally, vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.             

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

Phase I – Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  
Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:  a. Based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  
2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  
3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:

1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  
	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam sterilization processes as follows:      
i.   Class 1 Process Indicators – External Tape in ½”, 1” and 2” widths with

iv.  Class 5 Integrator/Integrated Indicators

b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed above.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I.  
	c. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and meet current ANSO/AAMI standards for this product line.  Provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.          
      d. Vendors must provide information on the reliability, safety, and performance characteristics of their products including the interpretation of the Indicators results, the endpoint-response maintenance during storage, the sterilization conditions that the Indicators will detect, the shelf life of the Indicators., and the storage requirements for the Indicators themselves before and after sterilization (ANSI/AAMI ST79P 2006) with the initial submittal.  
	e.  Vendors must provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions for testing, safety, and end-point values for all Indicators.  Provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions with the initial submittal.         
	f.  Vendors must provide a statement indicating their products/packaging related to this product line is latex-safe/free with the initial submittal.  

2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Steam Sterilization Indicators-Chemical product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in progress in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.    

3.  Vendors must provide documentation of agreement with the Northeast Region Prime Vendor (currently Owens & Minor) for distribution of Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.  Vendors must provide documentation in response to this RFRIAQ.  

4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.    

5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for product implementation and customer servicing as required for the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) within the Northeast Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. 

6.  Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Steam Sterilization Indicators-Chemical product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this standardization process.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this criteria.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this criterion.  

Phase II – Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process 
Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets and literature from the product group at no cost to the Government or POC recipient, to be sent to designated CPT members from participating MTFs for evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cost product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the designated CPT members.  NOTE:  Vendors will be required to notify the TRBO POC by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.  Requested no-cost product sample sets and literature must be shipped to arrive at the designated CPT member address no later than the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors who do not deliver the no-cost product samples by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO POC verification regarding the quantity, product descriptions, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and delivery receipt signature for the no-cost product sample sets.  Vendor’s presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. 

The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one  (21) calendar days.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (sterile processing department) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)—Strongly Disagree; Two (2)—Disagree; Three (3)—Neutral; Four (4)—Agree; and Five (5)—Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   

The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative—at or near 3.50—depending on the location of any “break:” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  

Following the manufacturer’s instructions/guidelines, the evaluation of Class I Chemical Process Indicators and Class V Chemical Integrator Indicators will take place at each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department) using a Laparotomy Set (or similar instrument set) in an instrument pan, and using a Small Fragmentation Set (or similar instrument set) in a wrapped tray as sample test trays during five (5) regularly scheduled vacuum-assisted steam sterilization process cycles.  Following the manufacturer’s instructions/guidelines, Evaluation of Class II Chemical Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick type test) will take place at each MTF evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department) during five (5) regularly scheduled vacuum-assisted steam sterilization process cycles (pack loads).  Evaluators will evaluate the performance of each type of Indicator in the Sample Set with the sample test trays and pack loads during the five (5) sterilization process cycles using the following established Quality Control/Patient Safety category clinical/performance criteria with a Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.50:       
         
      1.   The Class I, II, and V Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicator product packaging clearly 
            indicates the type of Indicator for which type of steam sterilization process.            
      a. Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicators are required to be specific to the type of sterilization process.               
b. Evaluator will assess for the ease of determining the type of Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicator by examining the product packaging.      
2.   The Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class I External Pack Tape and Tag) are easy to attach to sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan.     
a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must attach easily and securely.                
b. Evaluator will attach Class I External Pack Tape and Tag Indicators to sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan and assess for ease/security of attachment.          
3.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed, the Class I Chemical Process Indicator (Class I External Pack Tape and Tag) response can be easily determined to assess for exposure to the sterilization process cycle.    
a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the exposure to the sterilization process cycle.               
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the Indicators for ease of determining exposure to the sterilization process cycle.        
4.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class External Pack Tape and Tag) do not easily detach from sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.  
      a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must remain securely attached to instrument packs.   
      b. Evaluate will assess for secure attachment of Indicators after the completed sterilization process cycle.  
5.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class II Chemical Process Indicator (Bowie-Dick type test) response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (pack load).      
	a. Class II Chemical Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick type test) must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle.      
	b. Before pack load is sterilized, Class II Chemical Process Indicator is placed in pack load according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.
6.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class V Chemical Integrator Indicator response can be easily determined as Safe/Sterile or Unsafe/Unsterile for sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.
      a. Class V Chemical Integrator Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle.
            b. Before sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan is sterilized, Class V Chemical 
            Integrator Indicator is place inside sample test tray/pan according to manufacturer’s    
            guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed evaluator will visually inspect 
            the Indicators for ease of determining successful exposure to the sterilization process 
            cycle.  

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  
1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region—represents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched products—and  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines—unmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor—reduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, are more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.    
2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria, are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and do meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any “break” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      
3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.
4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendor’s quotes should contain the vendor’s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  
The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   
5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.

The SBI PMO is re-assessing requirements and will identify a new requirement at some future date. SBI expects to have the assessment completed in approximately three months, and will notify interested companies of the PMO's decision and path forward at that time.

The SBI Acquisition Office will release new information, pertaining to a new SBI requirement, via FedBizOpps.gov.  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the SBI Acquisition Office appreciate industry’s interest in supporting CBP’s mission and the SBI.

<DESC>The following is the Government's response to vendor questions:1.	QUESTION:  This question is regarding the $7.0 size standard. If a company has HUB Zone certification is there a discount, in the terms of percentage, to go over the $7.0 size standard?ANSWER:  No.2.	QUESTION:  Once personnel are recruited are they our (the contractor's) employee or the government's; so do we pay their salary, benefits, etc. or do we provide the candidate to the government and they take it over from that point?ANSWER:  The recruit becomes a Government employee.	3.	QUESTION: Sorry to bother you again, but is electronic submission acceptable?ANSWER:  No.4.   QUESTION:  Am looking for a clarification to your answer to Q3.  Eg: If my business, a US HQ'd global recruitment organization and has an annual US revenues over $35 million, but our Healthcare recruitment practice has an annual revenues of less than $6 million, would it be qualified to bid?ANSWER:  Yes.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment #0002 to Announcement #A2000090500, Solicitation Number N2000090500 issued on November 13, 2008 is to answer question(s) received to date.
1.	Can you please clarify the services to be provided by the firm providing "systems engineering"?ANSWER:  The Small-scale and Renewable Energy Systems Engineering refers to a holistic approach to building and site design that incorporates sustainable practices.
2.	Under section "REQUIRED DISCIPLINES" of the RFP, there are 3 sections parsed by letters A, B and C entitled, "required disciplines", "additional disciplines" and "incidental services". Can you please clarify if the additional services and incidental services are required for the submission?ANSWER:  The disciplines listed under Required Disciplines will be required. The need for additional disciplines will be determined in the progressive development of the project.  The ability to access and provide these services will undoubtedly strengthen the offerors proposal.
3.	Is it acceptable to include services not outlined in the solicitation in our submission? ANSWER: Submission of any additional support material under Section H of the SF330 is encouraged
4.	The RFP states, "the statement of qualifications will be no more than 100 pages, double sided."  Can you please clarify if this is 50 pieces of paper with 100 pages of text or 100 pieces of paper with 200 pages of text? ANSWER:  As stated in amendment #0001, 50 pieces of text, double sided.
5.	The RFP states, "The portfolio should consist of no more than 5 projects."  Can you please clarify that this means the Section F should be no longer than 5 projects, rather than the customary 10 projects in a standard 330 submission?ANSWER:  The portfolio under section F should consist of no more than 5 projects.
6.	The clarification notes that the firm(s) selected for contract award will be "predominantly a landscape architecture firm or an architectural or engineering firm with a large landscape architectural component."  Is it required that the referenced "large landscape architectural component" come from the prime firm (e.g. an engineering firm that has a landscape architecture department)?  Or, as an architecture-only firm, can GWWO submit as prime, with one or more landscape architects on our team as sub consultants to fulfill the landscape architecture requirements?ANSWER:  The landscape architectural component does not need to be the prime.  Most of the current projects are primarily landscape architectural.  It will be incumbent on the proposer to demonstrate that the landscape architectural component will have a strong guiding influence.
7.	Can a firm submit on proposal as a prime, and also be a sub consultant in the proposals of other firms submitting as prime?  ANSWER:  The government would not limit a firm from providing qualifications as both the prime contractor and sub-contractor.  The government will evaluate each proposal independently; meaning information submitted in each package must be stand alone and will not be allowed to make reference to each other.  
8.	In the "submissions requirement" section of the announcement, it states that "submission of any additional support material under Section of the SF330 is encouraged" but it does not cite which section.  Is this supposed to say section "H"ANSWER:  Yes
9.	Also under the "submission requirements" section, the announcement states that the "portfolio should consist of no more than 5 projects."  Is this referring to the SF330 Item F projects (normally ten projects are submitted with the 330)?  Please clarify and/or expand upon this requirement.  ANSWER:  Yes, the portfolio under section F should consist of no more than 5 projects.
10.	Do section dividers (tabs) and the proposal cover and back count towards the 100 (50 doubled sided) page limit?  ANSWER:  No

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment #0003 to Announcement #A2000090500, Solicitation Number N2000090500 issued on November 13, 2008 is to delete the requirement for Construction management in the Primary Services Required section of the announcement and answer question(s) received to date.
Reference the Section "Primary Services Required" in the original announcement;  The requirement for Construction Management is hereby deleted from the referenced section.  
The government has received the following question(s) to date:
1.	The RFP states, "SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and a Standard Form 330 (SF330) Architect Engineer Qualifications. Submission of any additional support material under Section of the SF330 is encouraged, but only to the extent that it is graphically (via drawings and photographs) substantiates the relevant project work specifically described on the SF330. All documentation will be in an 8 x 11 format. The portfolio should consist of no more than 5 projects." Can you please clarify what Section of the 330 should be used for the submission of any additional support?  	ANSWER:  This refers to Section H of the SF 330. 
2.	The RFP states, "submission of any additional support material under Section of the SF330 is encouraged, but only to the extent that it is graphically (via drawings and photographs) substantiates the relevant project work specifically described on the SF330"Can you please confirm whether 'the relevant project work specifically described on the SF330' refers to the Section F or any section of the 330? 	ANSWER:  This refers to Section F of the SF 330.
3.	What exactly are you referring to by "Risk Analysis?"  Insurance, security issues, or something else entirely? ANSWER:  Risk Analysis compares two or more alternative scenarios, action plans, or policies.  It typically results in a plan of action to avoid the risks or minimize their consequences.
4.	In the Subcontracting Plan Requirement it states "If the apparent successful respondent is a large business, the respondent will be required to submit a subcontracting plan. " and "The selected firm, if a large business must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract."  My question is if we are a small business, as we are, do we not have to meet subcontracting goals for types of small businesses? Many of our subs are small business but I wanted to see if we need to follow the same subcontracting plan requirement as large firms.ANSWER:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.702 (b)(1) "Subcontracting Plans are not required from Small Business concerns".
5.	We are a small business planning to submit an RFQ for solicitation # N2000090500. We have architectural and engineering sub-consultant on our team.  Are we required for stage one submittal to have all the required disciplines listed as team members or can a subcontracting plan be submitted prior to contract award.ANSWER:  The offerors either small or large must include qualifications of the team for evaluation by the government.  Small Business Subcontracting Plans (See answer to question #4 for applicability) will be required after the short list of contractors have been chosen.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis amendment is to update industry on the pending solicitation from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations, for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), Information Sharing and Knowledge Management Division (IM), Information Sharing and Collaboration Branch (IS&C).  The Government is restructuring the requirement from a Performance Based, Firm Fixed Price effort; with minor Time and Material (T&M) line items to a strictly T&M type contract.  Please note the solicitation number is being changed from HSHQDC-08-R-00013 to HSHQDC-09-R-00009.  Solicitation HSHQDC-09-R-00009 will be released in the very near future.  The solicitation remains 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms that are currently registered with the Small Business Administration.  The Government does intend to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference, and more information regarding that event will be posted on FedBizOps as soon as the logistics have been confirmed.  This effort will be procured under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 15 as it has been determined that FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items will not be appropriate for this effort.  The new point of contact for questions or concerns regarding this procurement is Ms. Tarasia Remhof, Phone Number, 202.447.5484, E-mail: tarasia.remhof1@dhs.gov or Ms. Peggy Hake, Phone Number, 202.447.0785, E-mail: peggy.hake@dhs.gov.

<DESC>U.S. Coast Guard Rescue 21 Project Resident Office Alaska is performing a preliminary Technology Assessment of vertical axis wind generators – vertical axis wind turbines.  The purpose of this preliminary assessment is to determine the feasibility of using vertical axis wind generators on harsh remote Alaska mountain tops as supplemental power for search and rescue communication sites.

The USCG has, in the past, tried several types of conventional horizontal axis wind generators designed for high wind and harsh environments without success.

Information is requested on vertical axis wind generators – vertical axis wind turbines in the 500 Watt to 10 KW range, specifically designed to withstand winds speeds in excess of 120 mph, wind gusts even higher, along with freezing rain, ice buildup, and snow.

The existing remote search and rescue communications site use a hybrid power system with a nominal 24 VDC positive ground back up battery bank for equipment power.  It is expected that new generation sites will be powered in a similar fashion.

The Coast Guard is specifically interested in Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) equipment currently in use.  When responding to this RFI, please include information such as number of units produced to date and installation/application information including point of contact/reference, location, year installed, etc.

This Request for Information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify potential applications for wind generated power for remote communications sites. The information obtained by this RFI will be included in a market study that may be coupled with a hands-on evaluation to identify which system or systems may be considered by the USCG for potential fielding.

This notice is for informational and market research purposes only; it is not a solicitation. The USCG will not reimburse for the information submitted. There is no guarantee that any solicitations will result from this notice but if your firm is interested in providing information please send no later than December 19, 2008 to:
