Statement of Work
The Bureau of Labor Statistics request a proposal for about 175-200 professional-quality photographs (8" X 10" black and white glossy) depicting workers in various occupations, to be published in the 2004-05 edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook, the Federal Government??s premier career guidance publication.  A few sample photographs from the handbook, can be faxed by calling Etihun Hailemichael (202) 691-6044. A copy of a previous edition of the Handbook, showing the desired results, can be provided. A reference copy of the Handbook is available in many libraries and school counselors?? offices throughout the Nation. 
Occupational photos taken for the Occupational Outlook Handbook should capture the uniqueness of the particular occupation portrayed. Photos should be realistic, at-work shots that show workers actively engaged in tasks typical of their occupations.
Photos should project a positive image of U.S. workers. Images should reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of the Nation and workforce and should include include both men and women in approximately equal numbers. To that end, the following portrayals are desirable, whenever possible:
?h Women in occupations in which they have not traditionally held a large share of jobs, such as scientists, engineers, and construction craft workers. 
?h Men in occupations in which they have not traditionally held a large share of jobs, such as secretaries, nurses, and elementary school teachers. 
?h Members of racial and ethnic minorities in professional, managerial, and technical occupations. 
?h Workers with disabilities in a variety of occupations. 
In addition, no depiction of workers should include violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations regarding safety in the workplace. Examples of violations include failure of workers to wear safety garb, such as hard hats at a construction site and latex gloves in most medical settings.
Photographs must be made on location in actual work settings that illustrate?Xin a non-posed fashion?Xtypical workers in specific occupations. The subject of each photograph should reflect a contemporary environment, including clothing, hair style, equipment, and work procedures. The work area should be as clean and uncluttered as possible and, as indicated above, free of safety and health hazards. Group photos should be taken where appropriate to the work being performed.
The photographer must submit a price per photograph.
Photographer must make his/her own appointments. A release form, which is attached, must be completed at the time of photographing to obtain permission from the subject(s) to use the photographs for various publications. Also, photos must not be for "one-time use" only because it is not uncommon for BLS to use a single photo multiple times. 
Ten 8" x 10" photographs for occupations selected from the attached list must be submitted for approval. If photographs submitted are not acceptable or recordkeeping requirements are not met, the right is reserved to cancel this procurement and to pay only for work performed. If the ten photographs submitted are approved, the procurement will proceed. The ten photographs initially submitted for approval are to be considered as part of the first increment. 
Photographer will submit a proof sheet of each assignment showing a minimum of 5 different views and/or poses of each subject in both horizontal and vertical formats, and one 8" x 10" black and white glossy print that, in the viewpoint of the photographer, aesthetically best illustrates the assignment. BLS, for editorial reasons, however, reserves the right to select another print on the proof sheet. Proof sheets, negatives, and prints will be paid for according to the agreed upon pricing schedule and become the property of BLS.
Each photograph must be labeled to specifically identify the name of the occupation and the name of the firm where the photo was tak

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to StratCom International LLC, for research and analysis of operational issues related to the performance of three missions from stratospheric airship vehicles.  These three missions are boost phase intercept, ballistic missile defense (BMD) surveillance, and relay mirror basing for ground-based lasers.  For each of the three missions, the research, extensive mission analysis, and payload definitions shall address the following areas: (1) Payload integration and analysis; (2) Operational scenario analysis; and (3) Operational issues and risk mitigation.  Research and analysis in the area of payload integration and analysis will require identification of optimum payload suites for employment on stratospheric airship platforms, development of concepts for integrating them into stratospheric airships, and identification of issues associated with the payload integration, including the identification of areas of technology shortfalls.  Operational scenario analysis will require determination of the number, placement and other operational employment features of the payload suites/airships needed to provide the required BMD mission capability.  In addition, the Contractor shall parametrically address the impact on these missions with respect to a range of interceptors, sensors, and relay mirror physical and performance parameters.  This analysis shall include, but is not limited to, identification and assessment of the effects of environmental factors such as winds, temperature, spectral (IR and UV) loading, and seasonal solar changes at representative mission latitudes.  Identification of BMD operational issues and risk mitigation will require examination of issues such as, but not limited to, payload reliability, survivability, basing and replenishment, and weapons launch from an unmanned platform.  In cases where the identified issues impose significant risk, the Contractor shall recommend alternative mitigation measures.  Additionally, where technology shortfalls exist, the Contractor shall recommend possible research efforts for future considerations.  The contract value is approximately $200K over a period of six months.  StratCom International LLC is the only known source with the necessary resources for the research area described.  This effort will not design nor will it build a stratospheric airship vehicle.  Any contractor who believes they possess the necessary resources and capabilities to perform the described research mentioned above, and possess an understanding of BMD missions may express their interest by submitting information that details their experience with relevant research in stratospheric airships, BMD mission analysis, and BMD payload definitions to Ms. Pamela Moore at Pamela.Moore@mda.osd.mil NLT 2:00 p.m. on 01 February 2002.

<DESC>This public announcement is issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Mangement System Section 3.2.2.4.1 (Single Source Procurement Process).  The FAA intends to award a contract modification to Northrop Grimman Systems Corporation, Norden Systems, under contract DTFA01-97-C-00004 in the amount of approximately $4,000,000 to deliver an Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) Mosaic radar for the George Bush International Airport in Houston, Texas (IAH).  This functionality is necessary to satisfy the unique operational site requirement for using two Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-3) radar sensors for surveillance and the AMASS for safety logic processing resulting in the provision of incursion alerts and warnings to the tower controllers.  The added capability shall present seamless airport movement area coverage utilizing both the local and remote radar as well as the ability to continue operations using either single r! adar.   <P> The decision for a sole source award was based on the following:  the current commissioning schedule for Houston of November 2002;  significant technical and schedule risk associated with this modification;  on-going modifications and improvements to the AMASS system as we are in the process of commissioning other sites; and impact to logistics support. <P> A request for more information regarding this effort may be obtained from Daniel Telfer, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington D.C., 20591 or at the above email or telephone address. <P>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498, for the annual production procurement of the fiscal year (FY) 2002 and 2003 AN/ARC-210 family of Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment requirements.  The FY02 and FY03 annual procurement requirements include up to approximately 600 AN/ARC-210 family of EP radios consisting of the RT-1556B, RT-1747D, RT-1824(C), RT-1803, and RT-1794(C) variants, inclusive of options and associated equipment; support equipment; engineering technical support; integrated logistics support; spare and repair parts; and associated data.  The RT-1556B configuration functional capabilities include simplex two-way communication of normal and secure voice amplitude modulated (AM) or frequency modulated (FM) signals in the 30.000 MHz to 400 MHz radio frequency (RF) bands.  The RT-1556B also provides the following modes of operation: a dedicated guard receiver which can provide continuous monitoring of the guard frequency in UHF/VHF bands of 243.000 MHz or 121.500 MHz, a receive-only mode of operation in normal and secure voice from 108.000 through 117.9975 MHz (AM), a maritime mode of operation in the 156.000 MHz through 162.025 MHz frequency band, and variable AM and FM electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) mode(s), these being HAVEQUICK, HAVEQUICK II, and SINCGARS.  The RT-1556B utilizes several types of data buses to convey control and status information among the various WRAs making up the system.  These include the MIL-STD-1553B AVMUX Bus, the Remote Control Data Bus, the Antenna and Filter Data Bus, and the DS-101 Data Loading Bus.  The RT-1556B provides 8.33 kHz channel spacing capability for compatibility with EuroCae (ED-23B), and is software loadable using Advanced Memory Loader Verifier (AMLV).  The RT-1747D has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus an added 70 MHz half-duplex converter and the software needed to select half-duplex channels, including SATCOM channels, and operate in the 70 MHz half-duplex mode for UHF beyond line of sight operation.  The RT-1803 has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, except the frequency of the dedicated guard receiver function is 156.8 MHz (maritime guard), and the RT-1803 interoperates on ?alpha? maritime channels. The RT-1794(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus added capabilities including embedded COMSEC, embedded DAMA for UHF SATCOM, Link 4/4A/11/Aircraft Carrier Landing System (ACLS), MIL-STD-188-220A protocol implementing Variable Message Format, and DS-101 COMSEC keyfill capability.  The RT-1824(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1794(C).  Additionally, the RT-1824(C) provides hardware compatibility for future DAMA A SATCOM interoperability, a plain text data mode, and enhanced VMF message processing.  The FY02 and FY03 procurement will be supported by an organizational to commercial depot maintenance with a performance and reliability guarantee.  RCGS is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the AN/ARC-210 Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment and is the only firm with the necessary knowledge, data, equipment, and experience to perform this effort within the required time frame.  Inquiries may be directed to Fax (301) 757-5955.  See Note No. 22

Format of Procurement:		Uniform Contract Format
Procurement Phase:			Market Research and request for information (RFI)
CBD Category:	Category R?Professional, Administrative and Management Support Services

The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement?s mission (pursuant to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 71) is to establish a new program that would train civilian police for international peacekeeping missions around the world. The current contract with DynCorp Aerospace Technology, Ltd, will expire Aug 2002.
The Department of State is conducting market research for any sources and participation in support of the CIVPOL and Law Enforcement Program for international peacekeeping missions and other complex contingencies around the world. Request comment on a few basic questions regarding the capabilities of businesses that may be interested in this effort. The anticipated contract start date is Aug 02.The Government?s purpose is to provide industry an opportunity to identify potential problem areas, and provide recommendations for industry standards. The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing possible cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with this requirement. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.
REQUIREMENT: The DoS is interested in learning whether any businesses can provide the following services, consisting of, but not limited to:  
  
1) Establish and maintain a cadre of up to 2,000 (U.S.) uniformed, experienced, and equipped law enforcement personnel, available to serve in civilian peacekeeping missions overseas.  The cadre will include a broad range of law enforcement experts and specialists, including generalists, trainers, border police, homicide investigators, crime scene investigators, managers (executive and supervisory), court security officers, corrections officers, intelligence officers, customs officers, dignitary protection officers, civil disorder specialists, organized crime investigators, and traffic accident investigators. 
  
2) Provide support, including transportation arrangements and per diem for basic, in-service, and specialized training programs developed by the Government for the cadre of up to 2,000 police, and provide in-country or off-site administrative, technical, logistical, or other unanticipated services, or actions to support the items cited in this RFI.

3) Support capacities for the personnel assigned to the civilian police, training and advisory functions.

The total period of performance will be one base year plus four one-year options, and will be incrementally funded. The government plans to make one award.

We are particularly interested in comments from industry on the following:

1. Is this type of service available as a commercial service acquisition?
2. Is this type of service available as a performance based service contract?
3. Identify any known regulatory or statutory requirements unique to government contracting that would impede the use of the best commercial buying practices.
4. What acquisition strategies are typically used when acquiring this type of service?
&#61623; Contract Type.  Please identify your reasoning for the most appropriate contract type. If an incentive type contract was identified, what kinds of incentives

<DESC>GSA is announcing its intent to issue procurements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The General Services Administration (GSA) contracts for local telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers on behalf of various Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within Region 5, The Great Lakes Region, comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Telecommunications requirements are generally satisfied through existing competitive contract vehicles; however, requirements are received by the local GSA Network Services Division field offices that are not able to be satisfied through these vehicles.  Requirements processed by GSA outside of existing contract vehicles normally include commercially available telecommunications services such as: Centrex service and features, business lines and dial tone services, local area access, and Intra-LATA point-to-point services and related inside wire installation and maintenance.  There may be an occasion for miscellaneous switched services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, or Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services may range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  GSA attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  GSA utilizes the Telecommunications Ordering and Pricing System (TOPS), to order local telephone services, track the order activity, and validate the invoice for services rendered.  Services are ordered and provisioned on a month to month basis.  GSA invites companies to identify service availability, by location, including provisioning intervals and point of contact, within the six state region identified.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a specific award as required to satisfy unique needs.  The GSA, Region 5, Federal Technology Service, 5TR, intends to satisfy these individual service requirements from the cognizant local service provider unless a response is received from this notice to identify other sources capable of providing competitive services equal to or less than the prevailing tariff rates.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications service requirements is 513310. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; identification of services, availability and pricing are being requested and individual written solicitations will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation, reference Number 5TS5702R004.  This RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 97-27.  The Desired Delivery Date and Required Delivery Date will be specified on orders identifying specific requirement.  FAR 52.252-2 applies to this acquisition.  Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this address:  http://www.arnet.gov/far.  FAR 52.212-1 applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-2 shall apply to this acquisition.

<DESC>Special Notice: THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Bi-Directional Exchange Information and Methodology. NO SOLICATION EXISTS; THEREFORE, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FBO. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  The Federal Grant Streamlining Program (FGSP), with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) serving as lead Federal agency, is currently researching potential business solutions for support of a common application and reporting system for Federal financial assistance management. The Federal Grant Streamlining Program is a Federal government-wide effort authorized by Public Law 106-107, the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, to improve the effectiveness and performance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify Federal financial assistance application and reporting requirements, improve the delivery of services to the public, and facilitate greater coordination among those responsible for delivering such services. FGSP is interested in industry's capability to develop tools to enable the Federal government to electronically receive grant applications and reports. Specifically, the FGSP is exploring the capability to conduct electronic grants (e-Grants), using existing desktop, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and web-based/web-enabled applications. E-Grants, in this context is the ability to electronically publicize grant opportunities, receive applications of various sizes from state and local governments, non-profit, and for-profit entities and send/issue resulting grants, as well as subsequent reporting and grant administration tasks using HTML, XML, and EDI formats. Applications are submitted using designated Federal government forms. or documents. Any proposed tool must create a package of forms and documents that can be secured from tampering after being signed by the initiator. Any proposed tool should allow for these documents to be exchanged electronically, legally sustainable, and provide assurance that: 1) the person/entity exchanging the information is in fact who they are representing themselves to be, 2) the information exchanged can only be received by the person/entity for whom the information is intended, and 3) the information has not been changed since moving from the originator to the receiving party. Electronic signature software is one method for providing such assurances. Proposed tools to receive electronic applications must consider the limitations of the various email and web-based systems. Also, such electronic applications must be able to be transported securely to a location accessible only to the Federal government-granting agency. Implementation across the Federal government is essential to the Federal agencies partnering in FGSP; therefore tools should be easily introduced and implemented across agencies. Electronic tools must be easily utilized at no or little cost, to the extent necessary, by entities submitting applications. Consideration should be given to interoperability across all phases of the grant lifecycle. IN ADDITION, LONG-TERM COSTS OF MAINTENANCE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.  FGSP is most interested and strongly encourages your insight, comments, and creative suggestions in this matter. Even if your company only distributes the product, or provides a single element of the bi-directional exchange process, feel free to give us feedback with what you could provide. In addition, your company's ability to provide us any information or networking leads as to what partnering relationships and innovative approaches other organizations are implementing to this end would be appreciated. Share-in-savings, or cooperative agreements are encouraged. GENERAL MARKETING LITERATURE IS DISCOURAGED, AND WILL NOT RECEIVE CONSIDERATION. SERIOUS

<DESC>BAA 01-42, ADDENDUM 8, SPECIAL FOCUS AREA: ENGINEERED TISSUE CONSTRUCTS (ETC).  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in innovative proposals to develop the technologies and science for supporting efforts leading to the creation of a three-dimensional ex vivo human immune system.  This system will be used for testing new vaccine constructs and immunomodulators that provide superior protection against threat agents.  The ETC program seeks to develop reliable methodologies that will accelerate the science and technology base necessary to achieve 3-D tissue engineering and to define the spatial and temporal requirements necessary to expand its applicability. This program intends to encourage multi-disciplinary teams, bringing together a combination of science and engineering communities to achieve its goals.  The ability to fabricate functional 3-D ex vivo tissue constructs is limited by current methodologies and materials in 3-D printing, culture methods, bioscaffolding, stem cell biology, and the controlled differentiation of cells.  ETC is a two-phase program addressing these limitations. Phase 1 will establish proof-of-concept that human stem cells can be reliably differentiated into multiple immune functions within an in vitro 3-D culture system. The capability to divert stem cells into multiple immune lineages is a Phase 1 milestone. Such differentiation should be verifiable by the presence of recognized surface markers characteristic of the cell type. Phase 1 targets include differentiation into early lymphoid lineages, Pro B cells and Pro T Cells, and early myeloid lineages. ETC should define the spatial and temporal requirements of the matrix, cells, trophic factors, and differentiation factors within the culture environment leading to interactive organ constructs. Phase 2 will focus on continuation of Phase 1 technologies and on producing interactive engineered tissue constructs of the functional elements of the immune system required for both cellular and humeral responses and its appropriate validation. Proposals in response to this BAA should describe an 18-24 month Phase 1 program only. Phase 2 proposals will be requested at a later date.  Proposers for Phase 1 should consider research efforts that address one or more of the following three technical areas: 1) A 3-D conformal printing system: the printing system should have capabilities for conformal deposition of scaffolding, cells, and differentiation factors.  Three-dimensional configurations should be adaptable and capable of utilizing computer-aided design or computer-aided machine technologies (CAD/CAM) to meet the anatomic requirements of the construct. In addition, methods to athermally ablate and/or sculpt the construct are desired; 2) A modular 3-D culture system and/or bioreactor: the 3-D culture system and/or bioreactor should optimize cellular growth, differentiation, and a functional stationary phase.  The design should be modular and adaptable to cellular manipulation and harvesting, and provide an environment that allows chemical and cellular signals to traffic between tissue constructs for appropriate processing of antigen. The growth chamber should be accessible for deposition, ablation, sampling and other manipulations of the 3-D tissue construct; 3) New concepts in the materials to be printed or deposited:  bioscaffolding should bind cells selectively, promote cellular differentiation and provide spatial interactions between multiple cell types and lineages.  Consideration should be given to expanding the complement of types of bioscaffolds beyond polymers and hydrogels. New concepts and methods that provide the release of differentiation factors in the appropriate sequence, concentration and duration, that enhance the binding of specific cell types, and/or that attract stem cells to an environment should be explored. A significant objective will be the ability to harvest and expand to scalable level human stem cell populations. Such expansio

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Marcia Rodrigues, Contract Specialist, (202) 273-8750
<DESC>Veterans Health Administration CFO Revenue Office Market Research  Commercial Practices for Accounts Receivable  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administrations (VHA) Revenue Office is seeking information from industry on the commercial practices employed by industry for accounts receivable.  Such information as what methods they use to collect and how to structure payment schedule.  This information will be used to assist in development of an Request for Proposal. Below VA has provided information regarding the purpose, scope, and background of the project; and final some specific questions that we would like industry to respond to regarding commercial practices for accounts receivable.   Purpose  The purpose of the project is to maximize collection of third party claims for health care services provided veterans.   Scope  This project includes all VA Medical Centers and their affiliated clinics. Background:    In 1986, VA received authorization to seek reimbursement from veterans and private health insurers for a portion of the costs incurred to provide health care for non-service connected disabilities.  Initially, charges were based on the average VHA costs for all care provided.  In 1997, a fundamental shift in VHAs billing practices occurred as VA received authority to bill reasonable charges for the provision of the non-service connected health care services.  The charges, implemented in September 1999, are representative of the amounts charged by non-VHA providers and specific to the market area of each VHA facility.  Reasonable charges are used to calculate inpatient facility charges, outpatient facility charges, clinician charges for inpatient and outpatient care, and skilled nursing facility/sub-acute inpatient facility charges. In FY 2000, VHA treated more than 3.4 million veterans providing 40 million outpatient visits and treating over 700,000 inpatients.  These services produced approximately 3.9 million third party claims and 11.8 million patient statements, which generated over $580 million in collections: 3% of the nearly $20 billion appropriated for VA health care in FY 2000.  VHA produces third-party claims for 16% of patients treated.  It is important to note that not all of the 3.4 million veterans treated have billable health insurance.  Many veterans are covered under Medicare, which is not billable by VA.  Other veterans are treated only for service-connected conditions: services that are exempt by law from being billed.  The implementation of reasonable charges has had a significant impact on VHA.  In comparing the first eight months of FY 1999 and the first eight months of FY 2001, we see that the total amount billed has increased by 42% -- from $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion -- while the number of patients treated remained relatively constant.  During the same time period, VHA collections increased by 34%, from $375 million to $504 million.  For FY 2001, collections are projected to exceed $700 million. Public Laws (PL) 99-272, 101-508 and 102-579 granted VA the authority to recover the reasonable cost of medical care from third-party health insurers for services furnished to a veteran for treatment of a non-service connected condition. CFO Revenue Office establishes about $2.4 billion in receivables a year, and collects about $787 million.  The overall collection ratio, at less than 40% requires action at multiple levels. This project will address the third party collection issue; resolution of delinquent claims.  Each year there are over 25,000 such claims amounting to over $175,000,000.00 over a five-year period.  In addition, there is an existing backlog of such claims at the Medical Centers that may increase this number.  VA would continue the process for initial billing and follow-up.   After a pre-determined time frame, accounts still outstanding would be turned over to a contractor for follow-up.  The contractor would be provided the veteran claim data containing the per

<DESC>It is the intent of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to issue a solicitation for advertising and promotion services.  The goal is to have one agency provide a seamless methodology for the implementation and support of a consolidated approach to the following: strategy, creative and production, media planning and buying, direct marketing and sales support, in-store point of purchase and other communications activities. 

The objective of this consolidation is to compete and award a contract to a single agency.  This will foster consistency and efficiency in our advertising program while realizing significant cost savings.  The Postal Service expects to obtain the most competitive pricing for advertising services by leveraging our volume, eliminating duplicated contract costs associated with multiple contracts, and reduce USPS internal costs associated with the management of multiple contracts.  

In order to abbreviate the solicitation phase, enhance competition, and ensure quality performance after contract award it is the Postal Service's policy to prequalify commercial suppliers.  With this notice the Postal Service will conduct a prequalification of suppliers for the consolidation of selected advertising services for the Postal Service.  The resulting solicitation will only be issued to those firms that are on the prequalified list.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the prequalified list if it is determined that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or certain suppliers are considerably more qualified that others.

We expect to award this contract in June of 2002.  It is anticipated that the term of this contract will be one year with options for the following five years and the USPS will expect continuous improvement throughout the life of the contract when considering the exercise of the available contract options.

The suppliers' response for the prequalification must be received no later than COB February 14, 2002. Mail being sent to the Washington DC area is currently routed through sanitation facilities before delivery to USPS headquarters.  If suppliers desire, hand delivery, email and fax response will be acceptable (provided the documents can be downloaded and/or are readable via fax).  Suppliers must contact the point of contact below to coordinate delivery of their response by any method other than US Mail.

The point of contact for the prequalification is:

<OFFADD>Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Office of Acquisition Management, HAAM, Room 4410 400 7th Street, S.W., Washington, DC, 20590
<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Testers of a High Accuracy Differential GPS (HANDGPS) System
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in association with the U.S. Coast Guard, National Geodetic Survey, and several other Federal agencies, is implementing a High Accuracy Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (HANDGPS) capability for test purposes at the Hagerstown, MD, Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) facility. The signal in space will be available for approximately one year as defined below and can be received by anyone with appropriate receiver equipment operating within approximately 200 miles of the Hagerstown facility. 

It is FHWA's intention to coordinate any testing done from this facility using this high accuracy signal with individuals and organizations outside the Federal government in order to collect signal data on the operational capability of this technology and to develop a broader understanding of the applications that could be developed if such a signal were available nationwide. 

The signal in space is expected to be available from February 2002 until February 2003. Note that there are several data sets that will be broadcast during this time period in order to determine the robustness of both the broadcast signal and the correction information. A final schedule has not been established but will be in the near future. Preliminary results indicate that the HANDGPS will enable 3-d positioning at an accuracy of 20 cm (95% confidence level) for points located within 200 miles of a single reference station. 

FHWA is procuring several differential GPS receivers and the associated decompression software that will be capable of receiving and demodulating the broadcast signal. Up to 4 of these receivers with software will be loaned to organizations to perform tests, for up to a two-month time period during the one-year test period. As a condition of loan, FHWA will require that any data collected be provided to FHWA (with unrestricted data rights) so that further analysis/reporting/documenting of this technique can be accomplished. Several recipient selection factors will be considered when determining recipients for these receivers. These factors include (in descending order of importance): (1) experience in the field of GPS, (2) capability to perform tests and analyses within the above identified geographical area, (3) ability to develop or further the development of equipment that can use this new signal in space, and (4) potential for developing applications based on this signal. 

Selected recipients will be required to provide their own interfacing IBM compatible (minimum Pentium level) computer system and GPS unit for use in testing and analysis of the differential GPS service. FHWA will be responsible for shipping the differential GPS receivers to the recipients. The recipients will be responsible for the security and care of the differential GPS receivers and their timely, safe and traceable return to the FHWA. 

Requested information: Electronic proposals are requested from interested parties starting February 1, 2002. Proposals shall address the four recipient selection factors as well as provide a proposed test plan. Address your electronic proposal to: james.a.arnold@fhwa.dot.gov with a copy to rudy.persaud@fhwa.dot.gov. Technical questions should be addressed to Mr. James Arnold, FHWA, at (202) 493-3265, or by email to james.a.arnold@fhwa.dot.gov.
