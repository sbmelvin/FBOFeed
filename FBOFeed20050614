<DESC>NAICS Code:  237110 Description:   The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to construct and complete Gilt Edge Mine Superfund Site, Phase 4, Ruby Gulch Waste Rock Repository and Cap, Operable Unit 3.  The objective of Phase 4 work is to complete the geomembrane cap system at the toe of Ruby Gulch.   The work includes: excavation and removal of the existing Ruby Pond impoundment at the toe of the Repository.  This impoundment is a geomembrane-lined pond which captures and provides temporary storage of acid rock drainage (ARD) which discharges from the Ruby Repository.  The pond geomembrane is approximately 10 years old and leaks.  Acid water leaking from the pond is captured and pumped back into the pond by a leak detection pump and by a downstream seepage cut-off wall and pumping system.  A new subsurface ARD storage vault and a new pond will be constructed.  The ARD vault is composed of a network of HDPE pipe and will require modification of the existing pump house.  Primary components of work include:: water for dust abatement, clearing and grubbing, stripping topsoil, removing water, earthwork, geotextile, geomembrane cover system, textured geomembrane pond liner, riprap, polyethylene pipe culverts, polyethylene drain pipe, relocating and reinstalling pump house, automating pump operations, and  Power lines in conduit. Since this is a Superfund site, prospective bidders are cautioned that the work requires compliance with CERCLA regulations.  The estimated price range for this construction work is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. This acquisition is being offered for competition as a total small business set-aside, using Sealed Bidding Procedures.  A formal site visit which will include a question and answer period will be conducted on/or about July 12, 2005 in Deadwood, SD.   The specific date and time will be published in the solicitation.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for 16 ea. 440V, 4000W Heat Exchangers, 10 ea 300V, 3000W Heat Exchangers and 40 ea. 250V. 3300W heat exchangers. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Instrument Service & Equipment, Inc. of Cleveland, OH.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. This type of load element has been used previously in load banks designed and built to support the Alternator/Thrust Integration Laboratory at Glenn under a previous contract.  Recent program requirement changes resulted in the design and build of new load banks.  In order to save design time and program money, existing load cart designs and assembly parts are being duplicated.  The subject load elements, while having different electrical specifications, will have the mechanical form and mounting methods.  Purchasing these load elements will drastically reduce the design cost for the new load banks and allow the use of existing hardware and assembly methods.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 29, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for a two-year cost reimbursable contract to provide the services for the project entitled “Clinical Decisions and Communications Science Center”.  The purpose is to establish a research and translation decision science and communication center that will facilitate access to evidence-based clinical and health care delivery information, and foster informed health care decisions by patients, providers, and policy makers.  The Sciences Center will work with AHRQ and its contractors to implement Section 1013 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. 

Under the contract, tasks will address a variety of assignments, such as developing health care information products based on effectiveness reviews (ERs) related to clinical and behavioral topics, drugs, biologics and medical devices.  Information products will be developed for 3 audiences:  patients, providers and policy makers.  Development of the information products will be based on an assessment that the Sciences Center will conduct on the target audiences and will factor in health literacy and numeracy issues, and other factors.  All information products will be pretested.  Additional tasks include: development of a health care interpretation guide which converts scientific terms and phrases used in medical research literature and health care discussions into plain language that is understandable to the general public; dissemination of all developed products and provide technical assistance to users; arrangement of two health care decision symposiums per year using venues appropriate for the targeted audiences; development of a mechanism for highlighting activities in the health science field; development of an algorithm for a prototype decision aid for ERs. The Sciences Center will assume web deployment responsibilities that include: migrating an existing Web site to the Sciences Center, develop and maintain a web site, maintain web-enabled versions of decision aids, create and maintain user e-mail.  The Sciences Center will be expected to have the competence and management flexibility to satisfy a range of single and multiple tasks that need to be performed concurrently.

Offerors are expected to have expertise in the development of information tools for a diverse audience, particularly consumers, patients, clinicians, and policy makers; developing decision aids that consist of information, values clarification exercises, and guidance/coaching; and developing and maintaining a Web site.  To evaluate offeror’s expertise in the aforementioned areas, the information set out below must be included in the proposal.  Specifically offeror’s process for:  (1) reviewing ERs, identifying key messages and translating into an understandable information product for each targeted audience; (2) identifying and defining scientific terms for an interpretation guide that is understandable, relevant, and meaningful; (3) evaluating the process and impact of products developed for the targeted audiences.  The plan should also evaluate the various dissemination modes; (4) disseminating products developed under this contract to targeted audiences, and provision of technical assistance to facilitate use; (5) organizing a white paper series on health care intervention decisions that will be followed-up with a meeting to discuss the papers; (6) arranging two symposiums each year on health care decisions for targeted audiences; (7) highlighting recent activities in the decision science field; (8) developing an algorithm for a prototype decision aid for selected ERs; (9) migrate, develop and maintain a Web site; (10) creating and maintaining user e-mail; and (11) maintain web-enabled versions of decision aids.

The Sciences Center is to be comprised of a core staff of seasoned professionals in fields such as clinical health education, behavior medicine, decision psychology, marketing and Web site services and development, writing and editing.  The proposed Project Director should hold, at a minimum, a doctoral or medical degree and have extensive experience in developing health information tools and program management.  The Project Director should have at least 10 (ten) years total work experience which includes: 1) at least eight (8) years in the SOW’s speciality services field in progressively supervisory positions;  and 2) demonstrated skills in organizing and monitoring complex projects conducted by groups of diverse professionals.

In the event that the Sciences Center core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the Sciences Center is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or sub-contracts.  It is AHRQ’s expectation that at least one topic-specific content expert will be included as key personnel for each information product.  

It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded for a period of 2 years with three one year options.  Award is expected by September 30, 2005.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQs website at www.ahrq.gov.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.

Through new construction and the preservation and modernization of historic buildings, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic buildings and related new construction for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

All future information relative to this procurement will be available to industry through the FedBizOpps and NECO websites.

(For the purpose of this source selection, the evaluation of “quality” as a factor is considered to be inherent in Technical Capability and Past Performance). The factors listed above, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated.

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Of! feror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single prov! ision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the c! lauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmat! ive Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WA! WF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.

The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Bell Avon, Inc. of 1200 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd, Picayune, MS. 39466-5427 or B/E Aerospace, SMR Technologies Inc. of 93 Nettie Fenwick Road, Fenwick, WV 26202 to acquire Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Fabrication on the LCAC Skirt Program, for phase 2 of the program. Under phase 2, more advanced materials are being procured from the FCT vendors.  More on-craft testing will be accomplished, but the phase 2 in-service evaluation will be more extensive than was done with the phase 1 effort.  Under phase 2, the US Navy will outfit two crafts, one at each Assault Craft Unit, entirely of test fingers and control fingers (except for the stern and inner fingers).  The entire set of outer side and bow fingers will consist of a combination of phase 2 test fingers, test fingers made of the better-performing phase 1 materials, and!  control fingers made of the current material.  This will allow a direct comparison between the phase 2 and down-selected phase 1 materials, and will make a final determination under phase 2 as to which material(s) has the best service life. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason: There are only two approved sources of supply for the LCAC skirt components under Defense Logistics Agency.  They are Bell Avon and B/E Aerospace, SMR Technologies.  These companies have already been qualified as capable of producing the skirt components, and are qualified as meeting the LCAC Project Peculiar Document (PPD) No. 802-6336530 “Skirt Fabrication Procedures”.  Qualification of any new suppliers would be a lengthy and costly process.  The anticipated award date will be on or about June 30, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Perio! d of performance will be from time of contract award thru 30 Sept 2005. NAICS Code 325212 Applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.  FSC 4720.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Maria Raquel Nunes, 1334 22nd Street NW #4, Washington, D.C. 20037, to provide services to the  NHLBI’s Hematology Branch, for the research existing protocol, entitled “Development and Monitoring of Selective Depletion Techniques for Stem Cell Transplants”for a period of twelve (12) months, upon an award of a purchase order.  The services will provide for the completion of translational research needed to validate several approaches to selective T cell depletion which is a technique to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after stem cell transplantation.  STATEMENT OF WORK:  Contractor Requirements: Specifically, the Contractor is expected to work  full time (40 hours/week), for  twelve (12) month period, not to exceed 2,008 man hours  performing research services testing the assay in small scale experiments to show that the technique discriminates between differences in MHC polymorphism and/or minor histocompatibility differences between HLA identical donor recipient pairs.  All work will be performed in Building 10 of National Institutes of Health (NIH) Campus, Bethesda, Maryland.   The Government will provide Laboratory space and all instrumentation and supplies that are needed for this contract.  The government will also provide a computer and desk space on-site with access to resources needed to accomplish the task. The work is monitored by the Director of  the Hematology Branch and the Laboratory Manager. The Contractor will meet with the Hematology Branch Director and Laboratory Manager on a weekly basis for informal progress meetings.  The work for this contract will also require close collaboration with other staff members of the Stem Cell Allo Transplantation (SCAT) and Hematology Branch.  The final approval of the Research services is the responsibility of the Director of the Hematology Branch or assigned designee.  This is an informal and interactive process which may involve multiple SCAT colleagues as well as technical personnel from the Cell Processing Laboratory, Department of Transfusion Medicine of the Clinical Center.    The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, of skills and experience clinician  skilled in immunotherapy and leukemia treatment, and  with laboratory experience in both the developmental and bench-to-bedside research.   For all this reason, it is most cost effective to award this contract to Dr. Nunes, who has the experience in performing small-scale Helper T Lymphocyte Precursor frequency (HTLPf) experiments.  An award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Nunes’s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted  under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement is not applicable to simplified acquisition.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes; documented experience of conducting and supporting the biomedical research in pursuit of knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burden of disease and disability.

The consultant must be thoroughly knowledgeable and skilled in immunotherapy and leukemia treatment being  conducted at NHLBI.   The statement of interest must propose a methodology of assuring the achievement of timely and acceptable performance of the work, as well as the proposed method for administration of costs relevant to this contract,  and at least three (3) references documenting past performance experiences and completion of the project.  The submission will be evaluated on the Offeror’s hourly rate, documented knowledge, skills, abilities, and experiences as reflected in the statement of interest, and past performance.  The statement of interest must be submitted on or before June 24, 12:00 noon.   The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for SAFETY ASSURANCE SERVICES (SAS) to provide critical safety and mission assurance (S&MA) reviews of NASA contractors that support key projects and programs. The type of services included, but are not limited to, test and inspection, configuration management, product review, process reviews, quality control reviews, mishap investigations, preliminary design review, and critical design reviews and document contractor compliance with specific NASA contract and technical requirements.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase these services from Dynacs Military and Defense for a period of up to one year.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.(c) (1) "...Only One Responsible Source."  These services are currently being provided by Dyncas Military and Defense, Inc under a contact with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.  The contract expires in November 2005 and the follow-on procurement was previously synopsized under Solicitation Number NNG05050549J.	  An internal decision was made in May 2005, to transfer program management responsibility from the Goddard Space Flight Center to NASA’s Glenn Research Center (GRC).  To provide for an effective transfer of program management responsibilities and for GRC to fully adopt program requirements; staff critical positions; effectively plan, solicit, evaluate, and award a competitive follow-on procurement, a “bridge” contract will be awarded with Dynacs for a period of up to 12 months commencing July 1, 2005.  Parties previously expressing interest in Solicitation Number NNG05050549J are welcome to participate in the planned competitive SAS follow-on procurement.  The draft RFP is estimated to be released October 2005.  As the current provider of these services, Dyncas is in the unique position to maintain program continuity as the management responsibilities transition to GRC.  Competing the “bridge” contract followed by a larger follow-on competition would have an adverse impact on the continuity of activities currently being performed on key NASA missions.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 PM, June 20, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete the “bridge” effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Yvonne Harris, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2011
<DESC>NAICS Code: 621511   THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO CONDUCT A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. THE TEXT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS BELOW: The National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, OH intends to negotiate using full and open competition for a project entitled "Sequencing of Metagenome Clones".  The objective of this project is for the contractor to conduct sequencing of fecal clone libraries developed by EPA personnel and provide sequencing date in electronic form.  The contractor shall perform sequencing reactions on PCR products provided by  the EPA PO and provide sequence electropherograms to the project officer. Task 1 is as follows: Sequencing of PCR Products?The primary task of this project is to generate sequence information from partial genes (PCR products) obtained from fecal clone libraries.  The genes that will be sequenced  for this project will be enriched using genomic subtraction methods and total microbial community DNA.  After the enrichment step, the genes will be amplified using PCR and directly cloned into TOPO A vectors (Invitrogen Corp). EPA personnel will screen the transformants for presence of inserts  (i.e., clones) using PCR.  The contractor shall comply with the QA/QC requirements as delineated in Appendix A and  consult with the Project Officer prior to performing Task 1 to revise standard operating procedures pertinent to this project, including data delivery and pertinent positive and  negative controls.  Those PCR reactions that show the presence of inserts will then be sent to the contractor for sequencing.  The contractor will perform the following steps: clean all PCR products, sequencing reaction of PCR products, cleaning of sequencing reactions, sequencing electrophoresis,  submit electrophorograms to the project officer.  The length of the clones will normally be between 400 and 800 bp. Unless otherwise specified, the contractor will perform sequencing in both directions with M13F or M13R primers which will be provided by the sequencing company.  Sequencing reactions  involving other primers will not exceed 10% of the total sequencing reactions.  The project officer will provide the sequences for any new primers.  The latter primer will be synthesized by the contractor.  It is estimated that 135 96 well plates of PCR products will be processed as part of this  task. DELIVERABLES and DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE The primary output of this purchase order will consist of electropherogram with a minimum of 700 bases per reaction with Phred 20 value per single base pair.  Preferentially, the data will be accessed by the Project Officer via internet.  Alternatively,  the contractor will send the data on a CD via airmail.  The data will not be shared with a third party unless authorized by the Project Officer.  The contractor should maintain a backup of this data for the entire duration of the project.  It is expected that the data will be compatible with  sequencing analysis software like Sequencer or DNA Star.  Due to the number of clones that will be sequenced in this project, the contractor must have high throughput capabilities and must be capable of producing high quality sequence data (i.e. clean readouts).  In the cases that the PCR do not  exceed 800 bp, it is expected that sequencing in both directions will produce contigs overlapping at least 85%. Microbial Contaminant Control Branch (MCCB) personnel will provide uncleaned PCR products and if necessary will provide copies of agarose gels to show the quality of the PCR.  As most  genes to be sequenced in this project are less that 800 bases pairs in length, the contractor shall provide a minimum of 700 bases per reaction of high quality Phred 20.  Failure to accomplish this would require additional reactions.  If EPA personnel provide good quality cultures (as evidenced by  gel agarose pictures on PCR reactions), the additional reactions needed to complete the minimum number of bases will be performed by the contractor at no extra charge.  The contractor shall complete the work within 12 months of purchase order award.  The contractor shall deliver at least 25% of the  total analytical services herein requested every (3) three months or 30-35 plates per quarter period. The NAICS code is 621511.  The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued on or about July  8, 2005.  To receive a copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Yvonne Harris, harris.yvonne@epa.gov by Thursday July 7, 2005. Requests via email are preferred or fax is acceptable. The fax number is 513-487-2107.  Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax  number and email address.  Reference RFQ-OH-05-000107.   Appendix A Summary of Steps Involved in Task 1 DNA amplification products will be visualized by EPA personnel with agarose gel electrophoresis.  PCR products and sequencing products clean up will be performed using the commercially  available kits.  PCR products will be inserted into pCR2.1 TOPO vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CS) therefore, M13F and M13R primers should be used in sequencing reactions. However, whenever necessary the sequencing reactions could be performed with other primers that align to sections of the  linkers included in this type of vector.  Sequences will be compared to public databases for identification and to determine phylogenetic affiliation. Quality Objectives and Criteria Data should be collected under standard procedures and conditions for molecular biology and PCR based  analysis. Special Training Requirements The person conducting these experiments must have training and experience in molecular biology techniques in order to obtain quality data. Person must be experienced in sample handling: DNA extraction, purification and qualification; polymerase chain  reaction methodologies; polyacrylamide gel methods; cloning and sequencing methods.

<DESC>ACQUISITION PROCEDURES
DATE: JUNE 14, 2005

REQUISITION NO: 05R000126

INTENDED SOURCE: AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWO AND A HALF MONTHS

PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES, AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY, THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 28, 2005.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS TO:

AHRQ IS IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING ITS ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY THROUGH PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, TO BETTER COORDINATE ACROSS CENTERS. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT HAS PROCESS, CULTURAL, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) RAMIFICATIONS. THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT BEGIN TO BE ASKED REQUIRE THE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION (KNOWLEDGE) ACROSS CENTERS, GRANTS, CONTRACTS, USERS, AND STRATEGIC GOALS. THIS MEANS THE (IT) ARCHITECTURE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO THE NEW INFORMATION DEMANDS PUT UPON IT. THE WAY INFORMATION IS VIEWED AND TREATED CULTURALLY IS ALSO AFFECTED. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH, WHERE SHARING OF INFORMATION (KNOWLEDGE) RATHER THAN HOARDING INFORMATION IS REWARDED.

ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAS IN MANAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IS RELATING THE EXPENDITURES TO THEIR IMPACT - ANSWERING THE "PORTER QUESTION." THE AGENCY NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IT HAS DONE, WHAT IT IS DOING, WHY, AND WHAT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN OR WILL BE. ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO CREATE EXACT RELATIONSHIPS TO ANSWER THE PORTER QUESTION, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EXPLOIT THE SAME INFORMATION STRUCTURES NEEDED TO ANSWER MOST OTHER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS TO HELP. ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE A CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE THAT WILL SUPPORT AT LEAST INDIRECT IMPACT ESTIMATES, AND HELP IN RATIONALIZING AND DEFENDING INVESTMENT REQUESTS.

TO ASSIST AHRQ MANAGEMENT IN ADAPTING ITS PROCESSES, (IT) INFRASTRUCTURE, AND CULTURE TO PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, THE PROGRAM REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING TASKS. 

1) ADAPT THE REQUIRED CAPITAL PLANNING AND INVESTMENT CONTROL (CPIC) PROCESS TO AHRQ'S SPECIFIC CONTEXT. AHRQ NEEDS TO INSTITUTE A REPEATABLE CPIC PROCESS THAT ALL AHRQ STAKEHOLDERS UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, AHRQ NEEDS A PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT APPROACH THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR RESEARCH INVESTMENT AS WELL AS (IT) EXPENDITURES .  THE PROGRAM BELIEVES THE CPIC PROCESS CAN SUPPORT THIS. THIS APPROACH SHOULD EVENTUALLY BE TEMPLATED AND AUTOMATED (CONSISTENT WITH PROSIGHT TECHNOLOGY USED AT HHS) IN SUCH A WAY THAT AHRQ MANAGEMENT CAN QUICKLY UNDERSTAND AND ASSESS THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT AND COMPARE IT TO OVERALL AGENCY GOALS AND DIRECTION.  AHRQ'S CPIC PROCESS SHOULD:

-PROVIDE CLEARLY DEFINED JOB ROLES

-PROVIDE A CLEARLY DEFINED WORKFLOW PATH, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN EVALUATION FOR RESEARCH VERSUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS
-AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, DEVISE A CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE THAT RATIONALIZES THE BUDGET TO RELATE EXPENDITURE TO IMPACT

2) DEVELOP AN INFORMATION (KNOWLEDGE) ARCHITECTURE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT AHRQ'S EXISTING AND PLANNED IT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PROVIDES MECHANISMS FOR ANSWERING AGENCY KNOWLEDGE-BASED QUESTIONS FROM BOTH RESEARCHERS AND MANAGEMENT.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARCHITECTURE IS TO GUIDE THE INVESTMENTS IN IT SO THAT ARHQ WILL EVENTUALLY CREATE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS THAT ANSWER QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT THE BUDGETING PROCESS IN A NATURAL WAY. ADDITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE SHOULD:

-LINK DIRECTLY WITH THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROCESS ABOVE, SO THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR PART ASSESSMENTS CAN BE PROVIDED.

-DESCRIBE WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM WHAT SOURCES WILL NEED TO BE COLLECTED TO SUPPORT ANSWERING QUESTIONS

-PROVIDE A LIST OF RECOMMENDED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO ENCOURAGE AN INFORMATION SHARING CULTURE

-PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEVERAGING SOCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO SUPPORT CPIC AS WELL AS AND THE EVERYDAY PROCESSES OF AHRQ

3) DEVELOP A TRANSITION PLAN FOR MOVING ARHQ FROM THE CURRENT INFORMATION (KNOWLEDGE) FRAGMENTATION AND HOARDING ENVIRONMENT TO AN INTEGRATED, INFORMATION (KNOWLEDGE) SHARING ENVIRONMENT.  THIS TRANSITION PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE:

-A SEQUENCE OF KEY STEPS IN THE PROCESS

-ANTICIPATED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH STEP, ALONG WITH POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES

DELIVERABLES

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS: A REPORT RECOMMENDING HOW THE OMB'S CPIC PROCESS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO STANDARDIZE, STREAMLINE, AND SUPPORT THE SELECTION, CONTROL, AND EVALUATION OF AHRQ'S BUDGETING DECISIONS.

ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING RECOMMENDATIONS:  A REPORT DESCRIBING THE RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE TO:

-SUPPORT THE CPIC PROCESS,

-CREATE AN INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL SUPPORT ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE AGENCY IS DOING, WHY, AND INSOFAR AS POSSIBLE, WHAT THE IMPACT OF ITS INVESTMENTS IS.

-MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW THE AGENCY CAN ADAPT ITS KNOWLEDGE CULTURE TO BETTER SUPPORT THE COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING THAT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REQUIRES. 




SESSIONS WITH EMM AND PORTFOLIO LEADS

MANAGEMENT BRIEFING:  A BRIEFING SUMMARIZING THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEIR RATIONALE WILL BE DELIVERED.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

THE CONTRACTOR IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE AHRQ THE CAPABILITIES SPELLED OUT IN THIS SOW.  TO ADEQUATELY PERFORM THIS TASK, THE RECIPIENT MUST POSSESS DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOVERNMENT CAPITAL PLANNING AND INVESTMENT CONTROL PROCESS.  FOR AHRQ, THIS PROCESS REQUIRES EXPERIENCE IN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO OMB EXHIBIT 300S AND EXHIBIT 53S.  THEY MUST ALSO POSSESS DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FEDERAL ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE'S PERFORMANCE REFERENCE MODEL (PRM), AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE CAN BE APPLIED TO THE UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS THAT AHRQ MANAGES.  
 
THE CONTRACTOR HAS EXPERIENCE IN ALL KEY AREAS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THIS TASK.  THIS IS CRITICAL DUE TO THE SHORT TURNAROUND TIME FOR DEVELOPING THE WORK (10 WEEKS) AND THE ABSENCE OF TIME TO TRAIN INDIVIDUALS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE REQUIRED DELIVERABLES.  IN PREVIOUS ENTERPRISE ENGINEERING TASKS PERSONNEL DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE METHOD TO RELATE IT EXPENDITURES TO AGENCY BUSINESS VALUE SO THE AGENCY'S PORTFOLIO OF IT INVESTMENTS COULD BE PROPERLY RANKED. THE CONTRACTOR IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO ADAPT AND EXTEND THAT METHOD TO APPLY TO AHRQ'S PORTFOLIO OF RESEARCH EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS TO IT EXPENDITURES. THIS ANALYTICAL STRUCTURE WILL BE THE BASIS FOR DEVELOPING A KNOWLEDGE BASED INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT THAT WILL ANSWER AHRQ'S QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS EXPENDITURES AND THEIR IMPACTS.   ADDITIONALLY, IN PERFORMING THEIR ANALYSIS, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE AHRQ A LIST OF RECOMMENDED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO ENCOURAGE AN INFORMATION SHARING CULTURE, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEVERAGING SOCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO SUPPORT CPIC AS WELL AS AND THE EVERYDAY PROCESSES OF AHRQ.
OTHER ONGOING WORK IN AHRQ DEPENDS ON THIS PROCESS BEING PUT IN PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IF AHRQ WERE UNABLE TO USE THIS CONTRACTOR, AHRQ COULD POTENTIALLY MISS THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT A REALITY.  THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS LITTLE OR NO BACKGROUND EDUCATION INTO AHRQ'S OPERATIONAL APPROACH TO BE READY TO GO, AND CAN MEET AHRQ'S NEEDS IN THE TIME REQUIRED.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice only and not a solicitation or request for quote (RFQ) document.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to modify Purchase Order No. HSCG38-05-P-100070 issued to Dassault Falcon Jet – Wilmington, New Castle, DE, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR Part 13.5 for the repair of one (1) each Horizontal Stabilizer, P/N MY20331-16, NSN 1560-14-477-2081.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to negotiate with DFJ-W on a sole source basis based on FAR Subpart 6.302-1.  Data is proprietary and available only to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  When HSCG38-05-P-100070 was originally issued, it was for the replacement of the bushings only.  The value of the procurement was not expected to exceed $100K.  The modification will include having the Horizontal Stabilizer repaired, exchange of rear fittings, repair of stabilizer tips, repair of stabilizer leading edges, and converting the FAR clauses from non-commercial to commercial clauses.  No solicitation will be issued for this action.

Closing date and time for notification is June 30, 2005, 4:30 p.m., Eastern Daylight Savings Time.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support  services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and  ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in  delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the  aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to  perform one or more functions A – D (or E with one of the above) are invited  to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to  determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of  the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more  functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative  small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they  are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone  certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or  Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are  submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the  offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support  functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which  you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.	What is your experience in this functional area (as described in this  announcement and in the Appendix)?  Please include detailed examples, duration  and scope of relevant past work, including names and phone numbers of POCs.   2.	List whatever standard business practices (ISO 9000, CMMI, etc.) to  which you adhere.  Include certification date, method, and level.  3.	Indicate your business size and category and if responding as a  potential prime contractor or sub-contractor. Provide specific examples of  your firms capabilities to meet facility/personnel security, ITAR  requirements, and to comply with the OCI and ACA restrictions. Sample study scenario may be provided at a later date for your consideration.   Please check the PIXS site for updates. All interested firms are requested to submit their SOC plus any sample study  scenarios responses (original plus 2 copies) by 17 Jun 2005, substantiating  each qualification described above.  The SOC shall be limited to a maximum of  five pages per function. Pages allowed for any sample study scenario responses  will be specified when posted to PIXS. Font size for the SOC is no smaller  than 10 pt Times New Roman. Submit SOC to ASC/XRS, Attn:  Ms. Patricia  Krabacher, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433-7224.  Any responses  received not clearly indicating which of the five function support areas the  respondent is a potential source for (or which fail to meet the page  limitation) may not be considered.  Submit only unclassified information for  consideration and evaluation. Potential offerors responding to this sources sought synopsis must indicate  whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 541710 with a size  standard of 500 employees.  An organizational conflict of interest clause AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002(Tailored), Organizational Conflict of Interest (Aug  2002)is anticipated in any resultant contract which is likely to restrict OEMs  from providing proposals for follow-on efforts.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Load Handling Syste m Modular Fuel Farm (LMFF). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider for the LMFF. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy fo r materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reducti on in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs. The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field  and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of LMFF systems. Operator and maintenance train ing, (New Equipment Training (NET)) will be the prime (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)) contractors responsibility. The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the prime contractor will be responsible for vehic le configuration, including recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintenance. PBL DEFINITION: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. INTENT: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 25 years. GOALS: DESIRED RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the LMFF System is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an inc rease in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and ultimately reducin g O&S costs to the Army. MEASUREMENTS: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation: REDUCED LOGISTICS FOOTPRINT: Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sus tainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization; REDUCED MAINTENANCE/REPAIR TIMES: Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system; RELIEF FROM CONDUCTING SUSTAIN MENT TRAINING: Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL SYSTEM CANDIDATES:  Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (Optempo) if available . See Appendix B for a profile of the LMFF System.

(12) Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service?  K eep in mind that this is a continuous improvement and learning exercise for the government and industry. We do not have all the answers nor do we even know all the right questions.  Please take time to relate to us any ideas/suggestions you may have in imp roving our questionnaire or any other areas where you may have insight. Send responses to this market research survey questionnaire to the PM POCs by email: Joe Scott e-mail address: scottjoe@tacom.army.mil and CPT Leon Williams e-mail address: leon.willia ms@tacom.army.mil.  Your organization may provide response to all or part of this questionnaire. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 30 Jun 05.  The response can be marked as confidential.  Clearly indicate that the information is Proprietar y if appropriate.  All participation is voluntary and no compensation will be provided for responding to this survey. The Army appreciates your participation in this survey. APPENDIX A - DEFINITIONS; PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL): PBL is a product sup port strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or Program Managers (PM's), their designated Product Suppor t Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s). PBL is: Buying results not resources; Using performance specs not design specs; Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a predetermined course of action; About assigni ng responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. PERFORMANCE SUPPORT INTEGRATOR (PSI): The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system. This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a private/public sector partnership). PRODUCT SUPPORT PROVIDER (PSP): The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to a ll providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to negotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC In ventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. NEW EQUIPMENT TRAINING: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materie l developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. SUSTAINMENT TRAINING: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistic s support of fielded systems or equipment. SUSTAINMENT MAINTENANCE: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Di rect Support (DS) tasks, General Support, and Depot maintenance. FIELD MAINTENANCE: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the so ldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) maintenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. OPERATIONAL AVAILABILITY:  A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B - PROFILE FOR THE LMFF; VEHICLE SYSTEM: Load Handling System Modular Fuel Farm (LMF F; MODEL DESIGNATORS: TBD; SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The Load Handling System Modular Fuel Farm (LMFF) is a Combat Service Support system that supports division and below units by providing bulk fuel storage, distribution and Refuel on the Move (ROM) across vari ous types of terrain and theaters of operation as outlined in the LMFF Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP), approved March 2002. At selected Division and below units, the LMFF provides the ability to rapidly establish a fuel distribution, sto rage, and issue capability at any location regardless of the availability of construction and material handling equipment. The system will be deployed in a 35,000-gallon capacity system consisting of fourteen 2,500-gallon tank-racks and two pump filtration  modules. Units requiring additional capacity can add additional 2,500-gallon tank-racks to meet their needs. The LMFF tank-racks can also be used for line haul of bulk petroleum throughout the theater. By using two tank-racks, one on the truck and one on the trailer; 5,000 gallons of bulk petroleum can be transported per trip, providing rapid fuel support when a Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP) deployment is impractical. OPERATIONAL MODE SUMMARY/MISSION PROFILE (OMS/MP): (1) Percentage of fuel issued by cus tomer type: Only peacetime numbers were provided; PEACETIME: Bulk Tanker - 40%; 500 Gal. Drum - 25%; Vehicles - 15%; Aircraft - 20%. WARTIME. (2) CLIMATE TYPES: Hot - 25%; Basic - 75%. (3) MOVEMENT TERRAIN: Primary Roads - 20%; Secondary Roads - 50%; Trail s - 15%; Cross Country - 15%. (4) PROJECTED ANNUAL USAGE: Per the OMS/MP and the Life Cycle Cost Estimate, only peacetime numbers are given. PEACETIME: The system will be used on average 7 hours per day with an estimated 2,555 hours per year. WARTIME. OEM:  OEM: Systems and Electronics, Inc., ST. Louis, MO. AVAILABILITY OF TDP: The Army does not own a TDP, the system was procured according to PD# ATPD 2336C, Dated 15 Jan 05. CONFIGURATION STABILITY: System configuration is currently frozen pending results of  Production Qualification Test. FLEET ASSESSMENT: The LMFF is a new system currently in Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP). The initial quantities to be delivered are 19 tank-racks and 7 pump modules for delivery to support test at Yuma Proving Grounds. Th ereafter, a total 48 LMFF systems, consisting of 14 tank-racks and 2 modules per system are to be produced thru FY11. G8 still owes us a distribution plan however they have indicated that the first units to be equipped are the Units of Action. There is onl y one configuration of the LMFF which has an Expected Useful Life of 25 years. ANNUAL SUPPORT WORKLOAD (MAINTENANCE AMMS): The Material Fielding Plan (MFP) states that the LMFF is estimated to require 180 hours of field level maintenance and 135 hours of s ustainment level maintenance per year. RELIABILITY - MEAN HOURS BETWEEN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION FAILURE (MHBEFF): LMFF Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) estimat es 350 hrs MHBEFF. DEPOT CAPABILITY - CURRENT WORKLOAD: None, system is currently in LRIP. ANNUAL SUSTAINMENT PARTS COST: Life Cycle Cost Estimate states $36,000 per system for annual replenishment of spare replacements and consumables. CURRENT ORGANIC SUP PORT: (1) SUPPLY AND LOGISTICS SUPPORT: Support objectives for initial operational capability will be full organic support.  Interim contractor support for supply will be considered to expedite initial provisioning, if required.  Integrated prognostics/dia gnostics will be used to the maximum extent possible to reduce the maintenance burden based on operational concept and total life cycle cost. Supply support requirements will be generated from a detailed analysis of maintenance tasks that will identify all  resources required for system support.  Provisioning Technical Documentation will be used for the identification, selection, determination of initial requirements, and cataloging of support items to be procured through the provisioning process.  The Logis tics Support contractor will be required to develop a Supply Support Summary using data elements as specified in LMI data product worksheets.  The LMFF IPT will review and approve the Spare Parts List and the Interim Support Items List.  The Provisioning D ata will permit NSN assignment, as required, and the procurement and stockage of high-demand items.  Initial spares (Authorized Stockage List [ASL] and Prescribed Load List [PLL]) will be provided to gaining units and funded by PM PAWS.  Replenishment spares will be stocked according to demand, funded and requisitioned by the using activity. (2)  MAINTENA NCE CONCEPTS: This procurement will utilize organic logistical support for the maintenance and servicing of the LMFF and will conform to the requirements and guidance IAW AR 750-1 (Army Materiel Maintenance Policy) and DA PAM 738-750 (Functional Users Manu al for The Army Maintenance Management System [TAMMS]).  Maintenance will correspond to the Two-Level Maintenance System concept (Field and Sustainment).  Field includes operator preventative maintenance (C), unit maintenance (O) and some direct support maintenance (F).  Sustainment will also include some direct  support maintenance as well as all general support maintenance (H).  Field and Sustainment maintenance will be preformed using standard tools, test, measurement and diagnostic equipment.  No depot support is envisioned for the LMFF.  A Preventative Mainte nance Checks and Services (PMCS) and a Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) will be included in the system technical manual. The LMFF will have a probability of completion of 1 day of retail and bulk fuel distribution operations as described in the operation al mode summary/mission profile without the occurrence of an essential function failure (EFF) of at least R(EFF) = 0.98.  The median time to repair (MedTTR) for all essential unscheduled maintenance demands (EUMD) will not exceed 1 hour.  The maximum time to repair for 90 percent of all EUMD (MAXTTR 90) will not exceed 1.5 hours. The total maintenance ratio will not exceed .07 maintenance man-hours per operating hour. (3) TRAINING AND TRAINING DEVICES: The Materiel Developer will provide a complete training  package that will support all phases of training for the LMFF.  The Training Support Package (TSP) will be developed to support New Equipment (NET), Institutional and Sustainment Training.  The system TSP will be designed and developed IAW U.S. Army Train ing and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 350-70 within the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) database and will be concurrently developed with the system and delivered in draft to U.S. Army CASCOM, Training Directorate, System Integration Di vision, for review and approval 60 days prior to Test Player training for the Limited User Test.  The LMFF System TSP will include electronic technical manuals (ETM), program of instruction, lesson plans, student and instructor guides and an instructional DTV (Distributive Training Vehicle) Web-based interactive multimedia package on the operation and maintenance of the LMFF.  The DTV will be provided for use in sustainment training and to facilitate distance learning.  An embedded training capability will be considered.  Instructor and key personnel training (I&KPT) will be provided for the initial transfer of information and training methods from the materiel developer to the trainer.  Distance learning will also be considered as a method of providing NET.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), may enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients cancer whose care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.  The overall objective of the work is to identify barriers and facilitators of high quality cancer care; and identify innovative ideas for safer, and more effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable cancer care in the United States; including potential gains in each area from clinical information systems.  The contractor shall conduct a literature review (both peer-reviewed and “grey” literature) on the quality of cancer care; semi-structured individual and group discussions; and site visits to a selected set of cancer care service delivery organizations.  The purpose of the semi-structured discussions with key leaders and practicing clinicians and of the site visits to a variety of oncology settings is to learn from clinicians, senior leadership, health care experts, and patients about their views, gather information for improvement including innovations in care, safety-related issues, barriers to high quality care, and ideas for change, even if not already implemented.  The results of this work will inform future projects intended to design and implement systems to improve cancer care services.   The contractor shall synthesize finding of the literature review, discussions, and the site visits and present the findings and conclusions to the government for its use in designing cancer care prototypes. 

PROPOSED STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INFORMATION ONLY:

Technical Requirements:  A) The contractor shall submit a plan of work in the form of a Gantt chart with dates for each milestone and annotations for each milestone that includes personnel effort and other resources to be used;  B)  Capture and summarize what is known about cancer care quality through (A) review of published and “gray literature” on cancer care quality.  Review the published peer reviewed and non peer reviewed literature in commonly used databases (e.g., PubMed, nursing, health services) and summarize the findings as a literature review with complete citations with a particular emphasis on the period of cancer care from initial suspicion through diagnosis and plan of treatment.  The contractor shall acquire and review relevant articles and relevant references in those papers and search for and gather “grey” literature (e.g., reports and position papers by commissions; papers and websites of professional, health system or health plan, and advocacy organizations) on cancer care quality.  The contractor shall summarize findings of the literature review and provide copies of the relevant references.  An electronic draft of the summary shall be made available to the government for review and comment.  C)  Interview health policy experts, senior leadership and researchers.  The contractor shall conduct at least 15 interviews by phone or in person.  Each interview shall be scheduled for approximately 60 to 90 minutes.  Interviews.  Within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews, the contractor shall provide a summary to the government in draft form for review and comment.  D)  Conduct group interviews with practicing clinicians in several oncology specialties and cancer patients and/or family members of cancer patients.  The contractor shall conduct at least four group discussions, with each group organized around a specific topic or oncology specialty, for example, medical and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, oncology nursing, and/or patient/family experience.  The contractor shall develop the framework for individual and group discussion and meet with the government to finalize the specific criteria required for the framework and shall provide draft guides for review and comment by the government before any interviews take place.  Discussion topics for individual and/or group discussions shall include (but not be limited to) perceived barriers to high quality cancer care, information needs and gaps, and desired functions of a clinical cancer information system.  Both practicing oncologists and experts in health information and information technology shall be included in discussions about integrating patient and clinical data to facilitate the flow of information across settings of care and specialties.  The contractor shall include discussion about how to foster the use of health information systems for informed decisionmaking by patients and treating clinicians and what value this data might have for quality measurement and improvement.  The contractor shall provide to the government in draft form for review and comment a summary within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews and a summary of results within 60 calendar days after each group discussion.  E)  Conduct site visits.  The contractor shall meet with the project officer to recommend the location and timing of site visits.  In this solicitation site visit means a geographic area.  A site visit may include multiple organizations.  .  .  The minimum requirement is the inclusion of no fewer than three and no more than six different geographic areas for site selection with the expectation that multiple organizations will be drawn from each geographic location.  Visits to each organization may vary in length from an hour to a day, and the time in a geographic location may vary in length from one to three days.  Discussion topics shall include (but not be limited to) how cancer care and interactions among specialists are organized, how care is provided, why it has been developed that way, the role of health informatics, perceived barriers to high quality cancer care, information needs and gaps, and desired functions of a clinical cancer information system.  Each site visit shall be summarized as a descriptive (not evaluative) case study.

<SUBJECT>T -- HEALTH JOURNAL
<DESC>The purpose of this procurement is to identify a periodical to facilitate the nation-wide dissemination of information pertaining to preconception care to healthcare providers working in the area of maternal and child health. The intent is to provide up-to-date evidence-based knowledge to providers charged with caring for women and children with a repository of information on preconception care. As such the periodical and its membership must be consistent with the subject matter being published. For instance it would be inappropriate to disseminate the latest evidence on flying airplanes in a periodical whose focus was on automobiles and whose membership consisted of automobile mechanics. Because this subject matter falls within the arena of maternal and child health the Maternal and Child Health Journal (MCH) has been selected. The MCH Journal is a peer-reviewed journal which means it is of the highest scientific caliber and its extensive membership includes a host of disciplines and professionals actively working to promote the health of a woman prior to conception. After careful evaluation it has been determined that the MCH is the only periodical having the critical expertise as defined by: 1) subject area knowledge, 2) extensive membership access (i.e. -AMCHP, MOD, Women's Health), 3) peer-reviewed journal, and 4) provider impact. It is therefore requested that the professional services needed to fulfill the intent of this procurement be obtained via the Maternal and Child Health Journal.  The request for quotations will be available from this website within 24 hours of this notice.  Questions are due by June 16, 2005 by 12noon EST and will only be accepted by email.  Once questions are submitted and answered they will be posted at this location all to view.  You may email questions to mce8@cdc.gov referencing the RFQ number.  The RFQ is due June 22, 2005 by 12 noon EST.  It is the government intent to award this procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP ULTRA-WIDEBAND (UWB) COMMUNICATIONS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP ULTRA-WIDEBAND (UWB) COMMUNICATIONS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to help further develop LLNL's Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar communication systems for military and government applications.

LLNL researchers have invented and developed a state-of-the-art UWB communications system based on Transmitted-Reference (TR) technique.  This UWB transceiver provides through-the-wall communications capability in heavy metallic and heavy concrete indoor channels. A hardware prototype of the TR based UWB transceiver has been successfully built and extensively evaluated in several field scenarios for harsh propagation environments such as cargo ships where narrowband communications usually fails due to reflection from metallic surfaces.    LLNL is seeking several industrial partners to help further develop this powerful technology and its numerous potential applications. 

With milliwatts transmission power these radios are able to transmit and receive seamless live video images using 0.2 GHz bandwidth signals through three (3) concrete floors each 12 inches thick. LLNL is in the process of filing patent applications for this invention with improvements to the range, robustness to jamming, and multi-user interference.


Benefits of the Technology

·	High performance in multi-path channels results in providing reliable communications in harsh indoor and urban environments

·	Low transmit power provides low probability of detection and intercept (LPI/D) communications 

·	The transmitted UWB signal is capable of penetrating through multiple 12’’ thick concrete walls.  This feature provides real-time seamless video communications inside buildings

·	High performance in heavy metallic environments

·	With minor modifications (using the technology described and claimed in above patent applications), the transceiver can become highly resistant to various types of intentional and un-intentional jamming as well as multi-user interference 

·	Trade off between communications range, power, and data rate offers variety of applications 

Applications Envisioned

·	Communications for various military operations such as voice, data, and image transfer

·	Wireless sensor networks for medical and military applications


LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to develop and mature early stage technology for military and government use. 

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in aiding in the development of LLNL's UWB communications systems should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.  Company Name and address.
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to developing
this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 105-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's UWB communications systems.

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  FAR Part 35 also applies as this requirement is for a Research Study.  The New Mexico Veterans Administration Health Care System (NMVAHCS), 1501 San Pedro Blvd SE, Albuquerque, NM 87108, is soliciting for a sole source delivery order to provide NYMOX Nicalert Urine Screen strips in support of Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Research # 519 for the VA Cooperative Studies Program, 2401 Centre Ave SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106-4180.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation as a Request for Proposal (RFP). A written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  The RFP 501-0042-05 number should be referenced on all proposals.  The VA intends a sole source request to award a Firm Fixed Price Definite Quantity Delivery Requirements Order for NYMOX NicAlert Urine Screen Strips Manufactured by NYMOX.  The Cooperative Studies Program is purchasing NYMOX NicAlert Urine Screens for CSP#519 which is an Integrating Clinical Practice Guidelines for Smoking Cessation into Mental Health Care for Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for a study protocol dated June 1, 2004.    The prospective awardee will deliver the requirements in accordance with all terms, conditions and provisions of this combined synopsis/solicitation for a two year period.  It is critical to comply with the delivery dates stated herein.  The issue date of this combine synopsis/solicitation will be June 14, 2005.  There will be two (2) line items for this request.  Description:  The NicAlert test is intended for in vitro diagnostic professional use for the semi-quantitative determination of cotinine in urine for the purpose of determining if an individual has been exposed to tobacco products such as cigarettes, pipes, or chewing tobacco within the past 48 hours.  If an individual has been exposed to second hand smoke, the NicAlert can identify levels depending on the exposure. The technology that is used in the NicAlert test strip involves the immunochromatographic assay.  This assay uses monoclonal antibody-coated gold particles and a series of avidity traps that allow quantification.  The sample collection end of the strip contains gold particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to cotinine, a relatively long-lived metabolite of nicotine.  The distance the gold migrates on the strip is shown by a clear color change and provides an accurate measure of the amount of cotinine in the sample.  The positive and negative controls are human urine-based liquid and are ready to use when taken out of their packaging.  The estimated requirement is for approximately 4500 strips delivered over a two year period.  Line Item Number One (1) NicAlert Urine Screen:  Shipment Instructions - Needed no sooner than 7/23/05 with the longest possible expiry date which should be no sooner than calendar year 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation AB133F-05-RP-1190 is being issued as a Request for Proposals.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  This procurement action will be competed utilizing full and open competition. The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 334220. 


1.0 INTRODUCTION – The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, conducts research on northern fur seals, a species listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The abundance of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) on the Pribilof Islands has declined in recent decades; the total number of pups born on the Pribilof Islands in 2004 was estimated as being less than one third the number of born during the 1950’s prior to the beginning of the current population decline. Because the survival and health of northern fur seals is likely related to the quality of the habitat they occupy and use for foraging, reduced foraging success has been suggested as a reason for the decline of northern fur seals. Since the mid-1990’s, the NMML has used satellite transmitters to track the locations of fur seals foraging hundreds of kilometers from the breeding islands during the summer months in the Bering Sea. However, fur seals spend approximately three quarters of the year away from the breeding islands, and little is known about the habitat used during the winter migration by adult females and, particularly, by their recently weaned pups. This data is mandatory for establishing critical foraging habitat of northern fur seals and to examine the effects of management actions and environmental change on foraging ecology.  
The following statement of work is for satellite transmitters (PTTs) for tracking adult females during the summer; and adult females, juveniles, and pups during the winter migration. 
2.0 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS - The PTTs will be attached to northern fur seal pups and females, so they must be small to minimize the effects of the instruments on the animals.  Therefore, the following dimensions (or preferably smaller) are required: 	2.1.A -  Type “A” PTTs must weigh less than 70 grams in air, and measure less than 65 mm (L) x 50 mm (W) x 25 mm (H);  	2.1.B - Type “B” PTTs must weigh less than 145 grams in air, and measure less than 90 mm (L) x 65 mm (W) x 20 mm (H).   	2.2.A - PTTs must have the capability of transmitting at 0.5W radiated power.  Due to different deployment durations, battery configurations must allow for the following:	2.2.B - Type “A” PTTs must provide 110,000+ transmissions at a repetition rate of approximately 45 seconds.  	2.2.C - Type “B” PTTs must provide 75,000+ transmissions at a repetition rate of approximately 40 seconds. 	2.3 - Antennas must exit all PTTs at a 45 degree angle.  	2.4 - All PTTs must contain a temperature sensor.		2.5 - To extend and control deployment length, all PTTs must: 		2.5.1 - Include a wet/dry sensor on top of the tag that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water; 		2.5.2 - Allow duty-cycling to user-defined blocks of time (so that transmissions can be limited to alternating days and/or to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view; NMFS personnel will provide duty cycling schedule to the contractor); 	2.5.3 -  Allow suspension of transmissions after the animal has hauled out for longer than 4 hours.		2.6 - All PTTs must be potted in resin (preferably yellow) to withstand pressure at depths up to 500 m of water.  The potting must be cast in as hydrodynamic a form as possible, given the limitations imposed by the internal components.
3.0 PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - 3.1 - It is the offeror's responsibility to provide information, evidence or exhibits that clearly demonstrate ability to provide the items listed in Section 2.0, SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS in a concise, logical manner, and should not contain material which is not directly related to this acquisition.  Proposals must address all evaluation criteria identified in Section 4.0, Selection Evaluation Criteria, Subsection 4.2, Factors. 3.2 - Offeror shall provide a minimum of four user references to whom the specified PTT instruments have been sold within the last five years.  If sales of the instruments named in the specifications have been made to the U.S. Government within the last three years, these references must be submitted. For each reference provide full company or organization name, contact name and telephone number, and best available Email address.  It is required that the offeror provide references 1) that address the type of satellite transmitters specifically called out in the specifications. 3.3 – Specific questions regarding this solicitation shall be emailed to Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov. 
4.0 SELECTION EVALUATION CRITERIA - 4.1 - The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer is deemed best value and conforms to the statement of work, is most advantageous to the Government, total price and all other factors listed below considered.  Your initial proposal should represent your best approach and pricing.  The Government anticipates award based on initial offers.  For this statement of work, the technical factors are considered equal in importance to price.  As proposals become more equal in their merit, the total price becomes more important.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

	                           					  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04. 

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for three (3) each, Vehicle-based Laser RADAR Systems to be used in the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ***
 

***All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line items:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish three (3) each, Vehicle-based Laser RADAR Systems.  


***BACKGROUND***

NIST is conducting research in autonomous outdoor navigation and in performance evaluation of intelligent vehicles and automotive safety systems.  This research requires a Laser RADAR (LADAR) system that can locate the road surface and can detect and track the position of objects surrounding the vehicle.  


***STATEMENT OF WORK***

The LADAR system shall detect objects (e.g., a stopped vehicle) out to 80 meters in front of the vehicle and objects to the side of the vehicle while turning or during a lane change.  The LADAR system shall detect the road surface (asphalt) out to 30 m in front.  The detection of objects and the road surface shall occur at a minimum scan rate of 10 Hz.  Multiple scan lines at different heights are required to detect the road surface and objects when the vehicle is pitching.  This increase in vertical FOV may be accomplished by using multiple emitter/detectors and/or scanning mirrors.   Multiple LADAR heads may be used to achieve the necessary horizontal FOV (front and sides of vehicle), but the readings shall be fused into a single scan surrounding the vehicle.  The system shall produce intensity readings as well as range reading for each LADAR sample.

A color vision system calibrated with the LADAR system shall be provided in order to visualize 3-D LADAR measurements.  The system shall be able to digitize and store the video for post-processing. In post processing, the LADAR measurements shall be overlaid automatically and accurately on the video for visualization purposes.  

Software shall be included to process the LADAR measurements to determine the position, velocity and orientation of objects surrounding the vehicle.  Software for identification of objects (e.g., automobile, truck, pedestrian) is desirable.  This object detection and tracking software shall run in real-time and off-line with pre-recorded data.  A Windows OS library interface shall be provided so that researchers can access LADAR and object data in real-time and off-line.  

The system shall include a consumer-trade GPS receiver and shall stamp GPS time and position of the vehicle for each LADAR scan.  The system shall provide software to communicate with the GPS receiver using NMEA messages over a serial port so a higher-grade GPS may be connected.  The software shall plot vehicle position upon maps using Microsoft MapPoint.  It is desirable that the system be able to interpolate the position and time of a LADAR scan in between GPS updates. 

The LADAR system shall have an external synchronization mechanism (digital I/O) that allows the scan to be synchronized with an input pulse and, when internally synchronized, provides an output pulse for each scan.
The LADAR system shall employ eye-safe lasers, be ruggedized, fully enclosed (weather proof) and capable of operating day or night on vehicles traveling on public highways at speeds up to 110 KPH (70 MPH) and on dirt roads at speeds up to 50 KPH (30 MPH). 


***TECHNICAL CAPABILITY***

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice constitutes Amendment 006 to a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation (CSS)Request for Proposal (RFP) W52H09-05-R-0230 and provides the Government's response to technical questions.  T he U.S. Army, TACOM, Rock Island, Illinois, intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed-priced type contract for a SINGLE AXIS TEST SYSTEM, with an option to purchase and UPGRADE to Six (6) degree-of-freedom (DOF) HEXAPOD TEST SYSTEM.  These two items are commercial in nature.  This notice is prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, and implemented by additional information herein.  Prospective Contractors are cautioned that any previously submitted offer will not be considered if dated prior  to the issuance date of this notice.  Initial and revised proposals are requested and a separate, written solicitation will not be issued.  This CSS is issued through SFI/FedBizOpps, as will any future amendments.  This CSS hereby incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04, effective 08 Jun 2005.     Single Actuator vs. 3 Actuators for Vertical Motion.  Question 1:  Is the intention to design the initial Single Axis system so as to minimize the upgrade cost t o a 6DOF system at a later date?  For example, a single, large actuator with table and head expander would be more cost effective from an initial standpoint for a single axis test stand, but the actuator would not be sized properly for use in a 6DOF at a l ater date.  For upgrade purposes, the use of 3 smaller actuators below a stiff table designed for horizontal and lateral actuator connections would initially be more expensive, but would be reusable in the 6 DOF upgraded design.  Answer:  The intent is to minimize the upgrade cost to a 6-DOF system. Hydraulic Power Supply Sizing.  Question 2:  Should the Hydraulic Power Supply be quoted initially sized to meet only the vertical requirements, with an optional upgrade to add capacity for the 6DOF, or should t he Hydraulic Power Supply be quoted to handle the flow requirements of the 6DOF system initially?  This could be done by leaving capacity on a common reservoir system to add pump/motor units as required, supplying two supplies and coupling the reservoirs d uring the upgrade, or sizing the initial unit to provide adequate flow for the 6DOF system.  Answer:  The equipment should be sized correctly for the 6-DOF.  Hoses,  Hard line, sizing.  Question 3:  The same question arises when sizing the hoses and hard l ine from the Hydraulic Power Supply to the Service Manifolds.  Should the initial Hoses/Hard line, etc., be quoted with the intention of reusing for use in the 6DOF upgrade, or should they be sized specifically for a Single Axis Test System?  Answer:  The requirement is not to have two stand-alone pieces of equipment.  Reuse of parts to accomplish upgrade from the 1-DOF to 6-DOF reduces overall cost.  Pit/Reaction  Mass Issues.  Question 4:  Is the existing pit constructed with any reaction or isolation mas s?  If so, what are the mass and vibration isolation details?   If not, does TACOM expect the supplier to provide these facilities along with the quotation?  Answer:  The pit has a 10 x 12 x 3 reinforced concrete mass that is isolated from the pit walls  by 1 dense foam board.  Additionally, the concrete mass is resting on bedrock.  Question 5:  Can the sides of the pit be used for attachment of actuators (any reinforcement in place)?  Answer:  The pit walls are of standard foundation specifications and are probably not adequate for attachment of actuators.  Question 6:  What is the expected connection of the system to existing facilities (alignment plate, co ncrete anchors, etc)?  Answer:  An example of an acceptable connection of the apparatus to the concrete mass is chemically bonded concrete anchors.  Facilities Issues.  Question 7:  What is the preferred location of the Hydraulic Power Supply and associate d distance?  Examples:  Close to the test stand (with noise isolation); Remote from the test stand, but inside (separate room); Outside in covered area; and Other.  Answer:  The preferred location for the hydraulic power supply is in the pit alongside the equipment.  If the size of the pit does not allow for that, the next likely place would be between 50 and 60 feet from the pit.  Question 8:  Should the system be quoted with hard line from the Hydraulic Power Supply to the Service Manifolds?  If so, what is the proposed floor layout, and are there any trenches in place?  Answer:  Hard line materials are excluded because the location of the power supply is undetermined at this time.  The hard line installation will be accomplished according to the contracto r provided specifications at the governments expense.  Question 9:  Is there any water cooling (chiller) capacity for cooling the hydraulic fluid?  If so, what is the capacity?  If not, should the chiller system be quoted (as turnkey installed)?  Answer:  The current plan is to cool the system with potable water.  Cooling requirements are anticipated as an inclusive item within your firms offer to determine the required, estimated amount of water on a yearly basis.   The Government determines the final me thod of cooling, determines if the quantity of water or material cost is excessive, and whether cooling towers will be considered as an alternative method.  Question 10:  Does TACOM have the capability to move equipment locally (riggers and appropriate for k lifts, overhead cranes, etc)? If so, will these resources be available for use during installation?  If not, then should this portion be included with this quotation?  Are there any union or skilled trades issues that need to be addressed for this installation?  Answer:  The contractor  is responsible for all labor, supplies, equipment, and materials to supply and install equipment, except as stated in CSS.  Performance Issues.  Question 11:  It is understood that the system will be used for road data replication related to truck transpo rt of packaged goods.  In light of this, a number of performance issues arise.  Should the acceleration and velocity specifications be considered Peak values, or are these intended to be sustainable, such as at a constant sinusoidal frequency?  This affect s hydraulic power supply and related accumulator sizing.  Answer:  The values are peak values.  The system isn not expected to sustain these levels on a continuous basis.  Question 12:  Are there a set of specifications that would be considered runoff acce ptance criteria to confirm performance is met?  For example, assuming a sinusoidal input, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4 inches, 10g cannot be achieved below 7Hz (stroke limitations).  Answer:  A runoff specification is not developed.  Question 13:  Th e intended use implies the inclusion of an advanced control software package.  Which approach does TACOM intend to use?  Adaptive Iterative Control, functionally equivalent to RPC, remote parameter control?   If so, what level of software is expected?  Dat a Acquisition,  Data Editing, Data Analysis; System Transfer Function, Coherence, and Correlation, Drive File Iteration, Replay, or Other?  Random  Power; Spectral Density Adaptive Control, Online PSD Control; or Other?  Answer:  The proposed system (6-DOF  system) should be able to reproduce an environment described by governments provided time based acceleration data obtained from a minimum of one tri-axial accelerometer block up to a maximum of three accelerometer blocks (3-channels up to 9-channels of d ata obtained with GFE).  The goal is to no longer test a test vehicle on a test track and to improve repeatability and accuracy .  Data acquisition beyond what is required for closed loop control and verification is not a current requirement.  An ability to capture basic analysis and report data for use in reproducing test environments and support publishing of test reports.  These  necessary features/software/hardware necessary to accomplish this goal are anticipated as part of your firms technical proposal.  Any supplemental list of expansion capabilities, along with optional hardware/software from your company or third party comp anies, is not required, but would be greatly appreciated at no additional cost to the Government.  Question 14:  A Hexapod is mentioned as the 6DOF configuration.  While this is plausible, the request for a Single Axis Test System and Upgrade to 6DOF syste m might be better accomplished with an orthogonal configuration (as opposed to 6 duplicate actuators as utilized in a Hexapod, or Stewart configuration).  Does TACOM have a preference for the specific Hexapod solution, or are other 6DOF configurations acce ptable solutions?  Answer:  The Government is limited by the pit construction to those allowed configurations.  A hexapod configuration appeared to be the most likely choice.  Onsite Visitations and Timing.  Question 15:  Is it possible to schedule an onsi te visit to review facility issues?  Can an extension be granted to allow for Shore Western to provide detailed quotations based on the above questions regarding the Scope of Supply?  Answer:  A site visit is not a requirement and the necessity and any cos ts involved are at the contractors expense and discretion.  Proposals are due by 2005JUN21, 1:00 P.M., local time.  There is no change, or extension for offer submittal.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby cancelled in its entirety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source firm fixed priced  purchase order to Rainin Instruments, Inc  Rainin Rd. Box 4026 Woburn, MA 18884. The purpose of this procurement is to identify a periodical to facilitate the nation-wide dissemination of information pertaining to preconception care to healthcare providers working in the area of maternal and child health. The intent is to provide up-to-date evidence-based knowledge to providers charged with caring for women and children with a repository of information on preconception care. As such the periodical and its membership must be consistent with the subject matter being published. 
For instance it would be inappropriate to disseminate the latest evidence on flying airplanes in a periodical whose focus was on automobiles and whose membership consisted of automobile mechanics. Because this subject matter falls within the arena of maternal and child health the Maternal and Child Health Journal (MCH) has been selected. The MCH Journal is a peer-reviewed journal which means it is of the highest scientific caliber and its extensive membership includes a host of disciplines and professionals actively working to promote the health of a woman prior to conception. After careful evaluation it has been determined that the MCH is the only periodical having the critical expertise as defined by: 1) subject area knowledge, 2) extensive membership access (i.e. -AMCHP, MOD, Women's Health), 3) peer-reviewed journal, and 4) provider impact. It is therefore requested that the professional services needed to fulfill the intent of this procurement be obtained via the Maternal and Child Health Journal.Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered by the contracting officer for competitive bids. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Mathew Ellington at 770.488.2677 or mce8@cdc.gov.

<DESC>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

Q. Item 2.0 REQUIRED COMPLETION DATE: Within 07 days after receipt of order.  Manufacturer requires 5-7 business days to build the antenna, prior to shipping. Can you extend Required Completion date to accommodate lead time and shipping time? Shipping Ocean Freight warrants best cost, however, may require up to 15 days to arrive in Honolulu minimum. Shipping air cargo method is available at a higher rate/cost. Please advise if Completion Date can be extended?

A. Vendor must meet required delivery date of COB (1700) 18 July 2005.

Q. Item 6.3 Install the new satellite system. Run all cables and ensure that they are neat and aesthetically pleasing
to the eye. Contractor is to run all wire runs properly with watertight integrity in spaces that so require it.
(Rox blocks and or stuffing tubes).  We would need more detailed information on the location of the antenna and the matrix switch. This will determine cable kit lengths needed. With the stuffing tubes, will ship's personnel be drilling the penetration holes and welding the stuffing tubes? Contractor will supply stuffing tubes? For this, we may request to visit the Kukui to do an on site inspection for the Antenna, Stuffing Tubes, Matrix Switch and Control Panel locations.

A. KUKUI's DC will drill holes and weld as needed to ensure water tight integrity.  Contractor must provide a schematic and or blue print of the wire runs to the DC onboard for the file.  Contractor will guide ship's DC as to where to drill the holes and where to weld.   All cables and or wires runs will be done by contractor. 

Q. Item 6.2 Procure all Contractor-Furnished Equipment and arrange for equipment delivery to installation site. Schedule 
A mutually acceptable installation date to occur as soon as possible after all equipment is on-hand.  Conflicts with Item  2, giving us only 7 days to complete the job upon receipt of order.

A. Contractor must ensure completion by COB (1700) 18 July 2005.

Q. Item 6.5 Install the Radome antenna onto the government provided mounting bracket.  The Antenna weights approx. 200 lbs. Will the Coast Guard supply a crane to install the new Radome?

A. KUKUI will provide either personell or a crane to get the radome up to the installation point.

Item 7.3 All Contractor personnel working on the job site must be U.S. Citizens.  We have serviced the USCG Vessels in the past. We have two service engineers with Alien Registration Cards and are authorized to work in the U.S. One Service Engineer is the our Service Manager who has been employed with us for over 10 years, the other Service Engineer has been employed with us over 2 years. Previously, Service and Installation of a Satellite TV Antenna was completed by these Service Engineers on the USCGC Walnut. We have never been faced with this issue in the past. Can an exception be made?

A. Contractors employees must a citizen, have an Alien Registration Card or be a naturalized citizen. (No illegal aliens allowed on the Base.)

Q. We would like to schedule an on site visit/inspection to make accurate determinations on the installation of the above and below deck equipment, mostly the above deck equipment. We are requesting to attend the USCGC Kukui the week of June 13, 14 or 15, 2005.

A. Walk through of the ship is encouraged and welcomed.  Perspective contractors must make arrangements at least an hour before coming to the ship.  Contractors must call (808) 753-7460 POC SK1 Jackson.

<DESC>Original response date of 06-15-2005 4:00 P.M. CT is changed to 06-20-2005 4:00 P.M.  Offers may be faxed or e-mailed; followed with an original hard copy of the documents. 	Responses to questions received from interested participants and our responses follow (responses are in bold itallics following the questions): 1.  Can you provide an estimate of POVs processed during non-surge periods?  We estimate 50 to 75 POVs will be processed monthly during the non-surge periods. This includes both in and out processing. 2.  PWS appears to state that there is only one (1) shuttle bus for drop-off service.  Am I correct in assuming that there is only one (1) shuttle bus for this effort?  If not, how many busses will be provided by the Government?    One 44 passenger bus wil l be provided initially; however, if more buses are required, the Government will provide additional buses.   3.  Reference PWS Paragraphs C.5.1, C.5.1.2, and C.5.3.2. There appears to be a conflict between these paragraphs.  The first two references infer that battery cable disconnection has to be performed in the presence of the vehicle owner or the authorized a gent.  However, C.5.3.2 states that this action is performed 'When the vehicle is stored in a permanent location after all handling-in documentation is completed...'   Requiring this action in the presence of the vehicle owner or authorized agent will grea tly increase the staffing required during Surge Periods.  Recommend the contractor be given some reasonable discretion in when battery disconnect is performed.  Please clarify.   Batteries will be disconnected when POVs are placed in the parking area.  Bat teries do not have to be disconnected in the presence of owners. 4. Reference:  Wage Determination (WD).  The enclosed WD has a Health and Welfare rate of $2.59; however, I am in possession of a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) memorandum dated May 20 2005 stating:  IAW the requirements of Section4.52 of Regulations, 29 C FR Part 4, the prevailing health and welfare fringe benefits issued under the McNamara OHara Service Contract Act (SCA) will be increased on June 1, 2005. As prescribed by the regulations the new benefit rate is derived from the latest Bureau of Labor Sta tistics Employment Cost Index (ECI) summary of Employer Cost for Employee Compensation. Effective June 1, 2005, the new SCA health and welfare benefit will be $2.87 per hour.  Please advise as to which H & W rate to use for this proposal.  Health and Welfa re rate of $2.87 per hour will be required in accordance with the May 20, 2005, U.S. Department of Labor Memorandum Number 198 to All Contracting Agencies of the Federal Government and the District of Columbia, Subject:  Service Contract Act Health and Wel fare Fringe Benefit Changes. 5.  Can you please advise what the servicemembers entitlement is as far as number of POVs they each may store?  The answer to this question has no affect on the price or the requirement during the solicitation stage.  This information will be provided to the successful contractor after award.
