<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting - Presidio of Monterey has a requirement for online diagnostic assessment testlets.  The base period of this contract requires the Contractor to submit forty (40) Government-accepted Reading or Listening Comprehension  quote mark testlets quote mark  (units of assessment) for Urdu, Pashto, African French, Brazilian Portuguese, Somali, Hebrew and Egyptian.  All testlets are to be delivered within a specified delivery period during the base period (one year).  The option period of this contract requires the Contractor to submit an additional forty (40) Government-accepted Reading or Listening Comprehension testlets. <br>   <br> ODA is a web-based diagnostic assessment tool that identifies learner's strengths and weaknesses, and provides feedback (may be accessed at http://oda.dliflc.edu.)  The primary function of the ODA system is to meet the critical formative assessment needs of resident and non-resident language training and maintenance programs. One of the challenges teachers and managers of military linguists in the field face is determining the actual language capability and needs of their students.  Although they may have comparable proficiency test scores, linguists enrolled in various remedial and enhancement programs typically vary in terms of individual strengths and weaknesses. The ODA system provides the program managers, teachers, and learners with an instrument to evaluate and manage their foreign-language learning needs. ODA (1) offers language assessment that adapts to the learner's performance; (2) determines and verifies floor and ceiling levels of proficiency; (3) collects diagnostic data; (4) generates diagnostic profiles and; (5) provides the learner with individualized feedback.  Sampling of learner abilities is systematic across a variety of levels, topics, tasks, and specific linguistic features. <br>  <br> Solicitation number W9124N-15-R-0001 will be available on or about 30 March 2015.     <br>  <br> The technical proposal will consist of, but is not limited to the following: <br>  <br> 1.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 5.201 and 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action. This is a notice of intent to extend the services provided under NIEHS Contract Number HHSN273201000001I/HHSN27300030 for a period not-to-exceed ninety (90) days through June 24, 2015. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and delays in service make competition not feasible for the extension of services. Award is subject to Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approval. The NIEHS intends to issue a sole-source modification to extend the services of Contract Number HHSN273201000001I/HHSN27300030 in accordance with FAR Clause 52.237-3 Continuity of Services. This extension will ensure continued miscellaneous compressed gases and gas cylinder tank services at the NIEHS are not interrupted while the contract is transitioned to a new vendor with an award date of March 24, 2015. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received within ten days of this posting. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish capability to fulfill this requirement. NIEHS will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Please email responses with the solicitation number in the subject line to Melissa Gentry, at niehs.nih.gov. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the

<DESC>NASA Goddard has a requirement to continue work under the Goddard Unified Enterprise Services and Technology (GUEST) contract NNG10FE01C with ASRC Primus.  GUEST provides support services in the areas of management and information systems, business infrastructure and applications development, system administration, network design, development and configuration management under a single integrator in order to develop, integrate, sustain, and manage IT infrastructure and systems.  NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension, for an additional six (6) months through November 14, 2015, to ASRC Primus pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source; the contract value will not be increased.  This extension will allow the continuation of current work and the addition of new work until the competitive follow-on contract, Goddard Information Technology Integration and Support Services (GITISS), is awarded.  The GITISS RFP was released on December 15, 2014 and proposals are due March 13, 2015. <p> The contract extension is necessary to ensure the continuity of IT support services to NASA Goddard, as this is a mission critical function to all Goddard Directorates and Support Offices.   The GUEST contract provides overall IT support services for the Goddard IT infrastructure and as such this extension is necessary to avoid significant adverse impacts to the Agency in carrying out the NASA mission.  <p> A sole-source award to ASRC Primus for the contract extension is necessary due to the nature and urgency of the work performed under this contract and the fact that we are conducting a competitive follow-on procurement.  ASRC Primus has the combined training, experience and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical IT support.  Should these services be interrupted NASA Goddard will be unable to utilize the IT infrastructure and systems required for daily operations.  If NASA Goddard attempts to procure these services from any other source for this interim period, it will cause impacts in fulfilling NASAs mission due to the additional time needed for any other source to reach the current level of expertise of ASRC Primus.	Because of the time in procuring and planning another contract, ASRC Primus is considered the only contractor that can meet NASAs needs given the short term of the extension.  <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing, via e-mail, to the identified point of contact no later than 2:00 PM local time on March 30, 2015.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon the responses of this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The installation Ombudsman is Nancy Bell, 301-286-5867.

USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding USU and its mission can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-80, effective March 2, 2015 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), effective February 26, 2015.</p>
<p>This requirement is set-aside for small business concerns under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 519130 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
