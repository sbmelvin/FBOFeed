AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utilties Privatization - Robins AFB, GA Water Distribution System. Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is on/around 20 Mar 2009. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

The Robins AFB water distribution system supplies water for residential, commercial and industrial use on Base. Construction of the water distribution system infrastructure began in the early 1940s and continues today as the installation grows. The system includes water wells, storage tanks, water treatment, distribution piping, valves, and other ancillary infrastructure. 
Robins AFB does not receive water from any off-base sources. The Base produces its own water from wells drilled into the Bluffton Aquifer. Six wells (Wells 1, 5, 8, 16, 17, and 18 ) provide water to the distribution system for use on Robins AFB. All the wells, except Well 18, have an emergency generator for backup power in the event of a power outage. In addition to meeting Robins AFB?s drinking water requirements, the system supplies water to industrial facilities in support of Robins AFB?s depot maintenance mission. The water wells and associated water uses will remain property of the U.S. Air Force. The water well is the actual drilled hole in the ground and the contents that cannot be removed without damage. This includes the well casing, well screen, gravel pack, and concrete grout. The pump, pump column, and all associated equipment beyond the point of demarcation for the water wells are included with the system to be privatized. The point of demarcation shall be the inside surface of the steel casing of each well. A separate service contract will be awarded to maintain the water wells.
Robins AFB?s ability to pump its own water is essential to its mission and security. A high emphasis is placed on Robins AFB?s ability to operate its water distribution system without interruption, and in the event of an outage, to return the system to service quickly. Degraded or interrupted water supplies will negatively impact the ability of the Base to meet its mission and productivity requirements. 
The level of water in the elevated tower (Building 175) controls the well pumps. A Microcat Class 9508 Smart RTU system connected to a Westinghouse PC 1100 programmable controller (NUMA LOGIC) controls the well pump motors. A new supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is programmed to replace current control system. The water control system is programmed to pump from different wells depending on the system demand. The system alternates the lead pump every 24 hours. This arrangement distributes the workload to minimize the wear and tear on motors, as well as to allow the aquifer time to recover. Well 18 is on a stand-alone system controlled by the water level in Storage Tank 2084 (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS)). When the new SCADA system is installed, Well 18 will no longer operate stand-alone. The SCADA system is not included with the system to be privatized.
The water distribution system includes four elevated storage tanks (Tanks 2084, 999, 912, and 175), with a total capacity of 2.25 million gallons (MG). All the storage tanks have cathodic protection and, based on the five-year maintenance schedule, are programmed to be cleaned and inspected in January 2008. Tanks 175 and 999 have lead-based paint coatings that have been painted over.
Distribution piping is constructed of cast iron (CI), ductile iron (DI), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and asbestos cement (AC). The most prominent pipe types are CI and DI; however, PVC is also present, but to a lesser extent. AC pipe is uncommon. CI pipe was used when the system was originally installed. In the early 1960s, DI pipe began to be used at the Installation. The use of PVC pipe began in the mid to late 1970s. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. The Contractor should not include any projects to install tracer wire on piping in their proposal. Any requirements for tracer wire will be addressed after contract award. The average burial depth of piping is approximately 4 feet below grade. Approximately 28 percent of the buried piping is beneath paved surfaces.
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions. This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, the industrial waste treatment plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed-waste storage facilities. Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination. This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations or beneath streets. There is very limited potential for exposure to workers or visitors in the area. The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for Industrial Area will be supplied in the Technical Library. 
As defined in the Section J3.12, Right of Access to the Utility System, the portion of the system subject to privatization extends from the wells to the edge of the building or to the upstream side of the building?s post indicator valves (PIV) or backflow prevention devices. The exception is the golf course, the Steam Plant, and the fire-suppression storage tanks at Facilities 95 and 20091. At the golf course, the point of demarcation is the upstream side of the meter, which is downstream of the backflow device. For the Steam Plant (Building 177), the system subject to privatization stops at the upstream side of the backflow prevention device on the service line to the 100,000-gallon storage tank. For the fire-suppression tanks at Facilities 95 and 20091, the point of demarcation is the upstream side of the altitude valve on the service line to the tanks.
Robins AFB treats produced groundwater at each well prior to the water entering the distribution system. Groundwater treatment consists of chlorine gas, fluoride, phosphate, and lime injection. Robins AFB has initiated a program to replace chlorine gas with sodium hypo-chloride treatment systems. Wells 5, 16, 17, and 18 have been converted. Wells 1 and 8 are not currently programmed for conversion.

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

The wastewater collection and treatment system at Robins AFB includes the domestic (sanitary) system. The industrial wastewater collection system and associated treatment plants are not included with the system to be privatized. Each system has its own set of collection piping and treatment facilities. 
The industrial system is made of up two treatment plants ? IWTPs 1 and 2. IWTP 1 discharges directly into the domestic treatment plant for final polishing. The POD from IWTP 1 is a buried valve at the north end of the Biological Treatment plant aeration basins. The treated effluent from IWTP 2 is combined with the treated effluent from the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant in the effluent pump station. The point of demarcation is where the effluent from IWTP 2 enters the wet well at Building 8369.
There is also an on-Base GWTP, whose treated effluent is also combined in the effluent pump station. In addition, the backwash from the carbon columns at the GWTP is discharged into the line from IWTP 1 to SWTP 1, upstream of the Biological Treatment plant aeration basins. The GWTP, and its associated infrastructure, is not included with the wastewater system being privatized. The POD for GWTP discharge is where effluent from the GWTP enters the pipe between the chlorine contact chamber and Parshall flume. The POD for the backwash is the buried valve at the north end of the Biological Treatment plant aeration basins.
Treated wastewater from the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant, IWTP 2, and the GWTP are combined in the effluent pump station prior to discharge offsite into the Ocmulgee River. Robins AFB?s treated wastewater is discharged into the Ocmulgee River under national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) Permit No. GA 0002852. There are three compliance points (outfalls) with permit limits for wastewater discharge, one each, from the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant, GWTP, and IWTP 2. Outfall No. 008 is the monitoring point for the IWTP 2. Outfall, No. 009 is the monitoring point for the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant, Outfall No. 010 is the monitoring point for the GWTP. 
The original construction of the domestic system infrastructure began in 1942. The domestic system consists of collection piping, manholes, lift stations, and a treatment plant. The original domestic wastewater treatment plant is not currently operational. In 1971, the original 1942 treatment plant was replaced with a more modern facility, which was designated as Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 1 (SWTP 1).
SWTP 1 was originally designed to provide preliminary, primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment prior to discharge into the Ocmulgee River. The POD is where the discharge pipeline terminates at the Ocmulgee River. The original treatment facility consisted of a plant headworks, grit chamber, grinder, influent Parshall flume, primary sedimentation tanks, trickling filters, secondary clarifiers, centrifuge, and disinfection with chlorine. Solids handling consisted of anaerobic digestion. The treatment facility was expanded in 1978 to include additional primary sedimentation tanks, aeration tanks (nitrification tanks), new secondary clarifiers, tertiary filters, and chlorination and dechlorination facilities. Aerobic digesters and drying beds were added to the solids-handling facilities to replace the anaerobic digesters. 
Except for the former digesters of the original biological treatment facilities, these facilities are currently not in use. One of the former aeration basins has been converted to an aerobic digester to increase the capacity of SWTP 1. The second aeration basin has been converted into a holding tank for temporary storage of IWTP 1 discharge. Temporary storage of IWTP 1 discharge is required periodically to prevent SWTP 1 plant upsets. Occasionally discharge from IWTP 1 contains constituents harmful to the biological treatment processes of SWTP 1 and requires reduced blending rates through SWTP 1. The holding tank is used to achieve the required blending rates to prevent upsets at SWTP 1.
Further modifications made to SWTP 1 treatment facilities include the addition of an ultraviolet disinfection facility and the installation a plant-effluent pumping station. Chlorine disinfection is currently the primary treatment as the ultraviolet disinfection facility is inefficient for final polishing due to the iron content in the wastewater. 
Sludge generated from the aerobic and anaerobic (following stabilization) digesters is transferred for de-watering to a centrifuge at SWTP 1. The de-watered solids are then disposed of offsite at an approved facility.
In the 1960s, a treatment plant was constructed in the Building 800 area, near housing, to handle the increased load from the housing areas. This facility was referred to as Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 2 (SWTP 2). Currently, treatment equipment has been removed from SWTP 2 and replaced with a lift station located at the former headworks, which is used to transfer wastewater to SWTP 1. This lift station and the drying beds, which are still in service, are referred to as SWTP 2. 
There are 50 domestic wastewater lift stations located throughout the Base that are used to transfer wastewater to other lift stations or manholes. All the sanitary wastewater is transferred to SWTP 1 for processing. Most of the lift stations are equipped with two submersible-type pumps. Pumps and controls at the lift stations have been upgraded or replaced since 1991. SCADA monitoring equipment has been added, or is in the process of being added, to the lift stations. The SCADA system is not included with the system to be privatized.
Original materials of construction for the collection system consisted primarily of vitrified clay and concrete pipe with brick manholes. New construction is generally polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, and concrete manholes. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. The Contractor should not include any projects to install tracer wire on piping in their proposal. Any requirements for tracer wire will be addressed after contract award.
Most of the pipe is 4 to 15 inches in diameter. The domestic collection system is comprised of several different piping materials, including cast iron, asbestos cement, reinforced concrete, vitrified clay, ductile iron, and PVC. Approximately 70 percent of the collection piping material is vitrified clay or concrete, of which approximately 90 percent has been slip-lined. The average burial depth of the piping is approximately 8 feet below ground surface. Approximately 25 percent of the collection system is installed beneath paved surfaces.
Robins AFB has completed a five-year collection pipe improvement program to clean, inspect, and repair the sanitary sewer lines. Approximately 50 miles of pipe were cleaned and inspected through this program. Approximately 180 point repairs have been completed along these sections of pipe. The repairs were noted as point repairs and also include some repairs made for pipe breaks, which were independent of the program. In some cases, the point repairs were instead full segment repairs. Generally, lines are being repaired by slip lining with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe or with an in-situ liner.
Air Force operations include occasional, unscheduled, discharges of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) to the wastewater treatment system. Current treatment plant operations include the addition of de-foaming agents.
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions. This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, industrial waste treatments plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed waste storage facilities. Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination.

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years.

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

Robins AFB receives electric power from GPC through three 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission lines that feed into the GPC switching station, which in turn supply power to the Base-owned substations at Ninth Street and Milledgeville Street. At the Ninth Street and Milledgeville Street substations, the 115-kV power is reduced for 12.47-kV distribution on Base by two 25.5-megavolt-ampere (MVA) transformers owned by GPC. The power is then fed into the Robins AFB substations? main bus structure, which provides power to the feeder breakers. The on-Base power distribution system is monitored and controlled by a SCADA system, which is not included with the electric distribution system being privatized. Robins AFB will not use the SCADA system after privatization to operate or control any system components without prior coordination with the Contractor. Robins AFB will work with the Contractor to institute necessary system safeguards and coordination procedures.
At the Milledgeville Street Substation (also referred to as Substation D), the power is distributed to the Base through eighteen 15-kV, 1,200-amp General Electric vacuum circuit breakers. The distribution feeders travel from the substation as underground circuits consisting primarily of 500-million circular mils (MCM) copper conductors in concrete-encased ductbanks, with final load taps made up with predominantly #2 copper conductors.
At the Ninth Street Substation, the power is distributed to the Base through eight 15-kV, 1,200-amp General Electric vacuum circuit breakers. The distribution feeders travel from the substation as underground and overhead circuits. The underground circuits consist primarily of 500-MCM copper conductors in concrete-encased ductbanks or directional boring conduits and final load taps made up with predominantly #2 copper conductors. The overhead circuits consist of both aluminum and copper conductors.
The electric distribution system consists of 3-phase, 4-wire underground and overhead circuits. Each circuit consists of three conductors with a concentric neutral. All circuits are looped to provide redundant capability to facilities. Underground circuits are buried in concrete-encased ductbank, with an average burial depth of approximately 2 feet below ground surface. Overall, approximately 17 percent of the distribution system is underneath paved surfaces. Also included with the system are medium voltage (4,160 V) secondary circuits that feed directly into high-voltage equipment, including motors, chillers, boilers, etc. This does not include the circuit feeding the PAVE PAWS/CT plant downstream of GPC Substation No. 3.
No cathodic protection equipment is included with the electric system to be privatized. The POD is the line side of the disconnect switch closest to the rectifier. The disconnect switch is not included with the electric system subject to privatization.
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions. This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, industrial waste treatments plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed waste storage facilities. Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination. This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations, or beneath streets. There is very limited potential for exposure to workers, visitors, or trespassers in the area. The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for Industrial Area will be supplied in the Technical Library. 
Robins AFB?s ability to distribute electric power is essential to its mission and security. A high emphasis is placed on the Base?s ability to operate and maintain its electric distribution system without interruption, and in the event of an outage, to quickly return the system to service. For example, to ensure uninterrupted service to mission-essential facilities, it may be necessary to enter energized utility manholes to perform system maintenance and emergency repairs. Degraded or interrupted electric service will negatively impact the ability of the Base to meet its mission and productivity requirements. 
Robins AFB also has the ability to generate its own electrical power. There is approximately 28 megawatt (MW) of generator capacity, of which, approximately 18 MW can be fed back into the system. There are two 3.3-MW diesel generators located on Base at the PAVE PAWS site. These generators provide emergency startup power to the GPC Turbine Plant. On a monthly basis, all Robins AFB-owned generators are periodically run tested. The Contractor will be notified prior to operation in every instance. None of the Base?s generators, the CT plant, or the associated transmission lines connecting these sites to GPC Substation No. 3 are included with the electric distribution system being privatized.
Robins AFB has a contract with GPC to receive a capacity credit for peak shaving. The Contractor will be required to support the Base?s program and not negatively impact the capacity credit that can be earned by Robins AFB.
Key facilities projects planned for Robins AFB will increase the total square footage of buildings on Base and the resulting electric demand. However, the electric distribution system has the capacity to meet a demand of 90 MW with the existing transformers. To reach this level would require a demand increase greater than 50 percent over current levels. Should the requirements of the electric distribution system increase to current capability, it would be relatively easy to replace the existing transformers with larger ones. The individual feeder circuits are also more than capable of meeting large increases in demand. The average feeder carries less than 3 MW and is capable of carrying 10 MW.

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

Natural gas is supplied to Robins AFB at three locations through pressure-regulation and metering stations. One pressure-regulation and metering station is owned by AG&L and the other two are owned by the City of Warner Robins. The AG&L-owned regulator station is located adjacent to Richard Ray Boulevard, west of Building352 . The City of Warner Robins-owned regulator stations are located on the northwest side of the intersection of Ninth Street and Page Road and west of Building 675, west of Laundry Drive. 
Natural gas is received from the suppliers and reduced to approximately 55 to 60 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for distribution throughout the system on Base. Odorization is provided by the suppliers. There are no government-owned odorization facilities associated with the natural gas system included in the solicitation. The system supplies natural gas to residences and facilities for space heating and cooking, hot water, steam boiler requirements, and industrial process equipment. It also supplies the compressed natural gas fueling station, which is used to supply the Base?s alternative-fuel vehicles. The distribution system is looped so that nearly all locations/buildings can be fed from at least two different paths. There are approximately 130 buildings and 760 housing units connected to the system.
The Base operates a propane/air-peaking system, which includes twelve 60,000-gallon propane storage tanks, that can be used to supplement or curtail the use of natural gas supplied from off-base sources. The propane/air-peaking system is not included with the natural gas distribution system being privatized. The Robins AFB-owned propane/air-peaking system is located on Marchbanks Drive.
The original sections of the gas system were constructed in the 1950s. The original gas system piping consisted of black iron and steel pipe. Portions of these pipes were abandoned in place and replaced with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe. New construction is generally HDPE pipe. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. The Contractor should not include any projects to install tracer wire on piping in their proposal. Any requirements for tracer wire will be addressed after contract award.
The distribution system piping consists of approximately 177,652 linear feet of pipe. Materials of construction include coated and wrapped steel, black iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and HDPE. More than 50 percent of the system is of an unknown material type, but is likely to be coated and wrapped steel. Approximately 40 percent of the system is non-metallic. Piping ranges in size from ? inch to 8 inches in diameter. The burial depth for buried infrastructure is between 2 and 4 feet below ground surface. Approximately 10 percent of the distribution system is underneath parking lots, pavements, roadways, etc. The steel piping systems are protected from external corrosion by an impressed current cathodic protection system. A total of five rectifiers are installed throughout the Base to protect the metallic natural gas piping. 
Ten district regulator stations further reduce the natural gas supply pressure throughout the distribution system. Nine of these district regulator stations are included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation of the natural gas distribution system. The other district regulator station (Turner Housing Regulator Station), located approximately 50 yards southwest of the intersection of Turner Parkway and Twelfth Street, is owned by the Housing Privatization Contractor and is not included in the Utilities Privatization Solicitation. The stations are typically above grade and are protected by concrete-block walls or fencing. The regulator stations are designed in a self-monitoring configuration to provide pressure regulation and over-pressure protection. The regulator stations also include a bypass loop to allow for continued operation in the event of a regulator failure. Eight of these regulator stations, including the Turner Housing regulator station, reduce the pressure to approximately 35 psig to serve the housing areas. 
There are numerous small, single regulator installations that reduce the pressure to the desired service pressure for end device use, such as boilers, stoves, and heating units. Typical gas pressure for equipment and appliance use in buildings is 7 inches of water to 1 psig. A few buildings are served at higher pressures, such as 5 psig or higher, for boiler or process equipment use. Gas meters are installed throughout the distribution system and are used for internal billing and energy management purposes. 
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions. This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, industrial waste treatments plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed waste storage facilities. Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination. This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations, or beneath streets. There is very limited potential for exposure to workers or visitors in the area. The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area will be supplied in the Technical Library. 
The City of Warner Robins supplies gas directly to the Museum of Aviation. This remote facility is metered separately and is not included with the natural gas distribution system being considered for privatization. The point of demarcation for the distribution line supplying the Museum of Aviation is the downstream side of the meter.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE - The government intends to award a Cost Type Contract for the Operation and Maintenance of real property and equipment within the Chemical Defense Training Facility (CDTF) at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.  Operations and maintenance duties include work on a Direct Digital Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Integrated Control System, safety operations, environmental monitoring, miniature chemical agent monitoring systems, and protective clothing and equipment maintenance and certification operations.  The The United States Army Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear School (USACBRNS) operates the CDTF to train all members of the Joint Force, as well as international allied military partners, in CBRN defense under actual toxic chemical agent environmental conditions.  The CDTF at Fort Leonard Wood is the only facility of its kind in the Department of Defense.  Its modern design and engineering, air filtration systems, and state-of-the-art technology provides safe, realistic toxic agent training.    The complex consists of an administration building, a guard house (entry control point), six outdoor training pads, an outdoor mock-up equipment doff area, the main training building, and a storage building for supplies and materiel.  The main training building has a medical aid station, a chemical laboratory, a centralized air monitoring control room, male and female locker-rooms, a laundry, an equipment maintenance area, solid and liquid waste holding areas, air filter banks, and the facility safety control room.  Two large training bays, a service rotunda, and six individual training bays complete the floor plan.  The design philosophy for the main training building incorporates protection of the environment and safety of CDTF personnel.  The training building is maintained under constant negative air pressure to insure no toxic vapors migrate to the outside.  Technicians produce toxic agents through the mixing of binary precursors in the laboratory and then store the agents in blast-proof vaults.  Instructors use these agents in small quantities within the toxic bays during CBRN defense training.   The contractor will be required to provide well qualified personnel for staffing for the facility's operation, maintenance, janitorial, clerical as well as the Training Support Team (TST).

Reclamation is required by multiple cultural and historical protection Acts to protect cultural resources on Reclamation lands.  Enforcement of road closures on Reclamation lands in Power County is a necessary action in fulfilling our legal obligation to protect these resources.  Power County Sheriff's Department is the only entity with authority to provide security patrols to implement State and local statutes.  These areas are heavily impacted during the spring, summer and fall season; therefore enhanced security patrols for the period between May through November will contribute toward the protection of cultural resources.
The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only a single source under the authority of FAR 6.001(a) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and there is no solicitation available.  However, proposals received by April 1, 2009, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source award to Healthy Housing Solutions, National Center for Healthy Housing, 10320 Little Patuxent Parkway, Suite 500, Columbia, MD for National Lead Poisoning Prevention Training Center contract. As a leader in the Lead Poisoning Prevention field at the local and national level, Healthy Housing Solutions possess the necessary link of having expertise in providing HUD approved healthy housing training to health and housing professionals.
<p>The Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to initiate program efforts to eliminate childhood lead poisoning in the United States. As a result of this Act, the CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch was created, with primary responsibility to develop programs and policies to prevent childhood lead poisoning. Also, to educate the public and health-care providers about childhood lead poisoning.</p>
<p>CDC has a need to provide training and education to public health practitioners working in state and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. Staffing changes at the state and local government levels in many health programs have placed new staff into Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Programs (CLPPP) who are inexperienced in lead programming or other aspects of the CLPPP essential to their position. The education and training provided through this procurement will enhance the ability of new staff to deliver quality CLPPPs in their state and local jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The nature of this action is to provide programmatic training to CDC grantees that will lead to the reducing and elimination of the number of children with elevated blood lead levels within their communities. It is also to provide basic instruction as to properly operating a childhood lead poisoning program, and executing program techniques and methods that intervene in the exposure to lead hazards and conditions.</p>
<p>This is a only a&nbsp;synopsis. An official solicitation will be subsequently issued directly based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit capability statement/qualifications demonstrating their abilities to provide the services outlined in the attached Statement of Work. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. All responses shall be submitted via email to MEAllen@cdc.gov with the reference number (2009-64285- National Lead Poisoning Prevention Training) referenced in the subject line no-later-than 3:30 PM Eastern Time, January 15, 2009. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC.

<DESC><p>This is for informational purposes only. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to solicit and negotiate, on the basis of other than full and open competition, technical support services with the Public Health Systems Partners. In March 2008, a competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) was issued by the CDC for a cooperative agreement program entitled "Strengthen and Improve the Nation's Public Health Capacity through National, Non-Profit, Professional Public Health Organizations to Increase Health Protection and Health Equity." The primary purpose of this cooperative agreement program is to strengthen the nation's public health capacity by improving the quality and performance of public health practice, public health systems, public health data and data systems, and the public health workforce. Cooperative Agreements were issued to the eleven (11) most highly qualified applicants. These eleven (11) non-profit grant holders are referred to as the Public Health Systems Partners (PHSP). The PHSP are established national non-governmental public health organizations that have demonstrated leadership and public health expertise providing policy and program guidance, technical assistance and training, and access to all segments of the public health infrastructure (institutions and workforce). The PHSP represent critical partnerships that work with public health institutions and its' workforce (health departments; boards of health; schools of public health; and public health leaders, practitioners and students) and with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies to improve public health for all Americans. The PHSP are significant, uniquely capable entities in their own right that have gained additional experience and expertise through their activities under these cooperative agreements. That combination of capability, capacity, constituent reach, experience, and expertise is not reproducible and is not available from another source or set of sources. As such, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to award up to eleven (11) task order contracts to the PHSP, to leverage their resources, infrastructure, and services to assist CDC to fulfill its mission, strategies and objectives at all levels of Public Health, including Federal, state, and local levels. The planned task order contracts will make that existing beneficial combination accessible to the CDC for the acquisition of services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government, in addition to the Federal Government supporting meritorious public purposes through the cooperative agreement program. Technical support services with the PHSP will focus on efforts that protect and improve the health of all people and all communities by promoting national policy, developing resources and programs, seeking health equity, and supporting effective state and local public health practice and systems. As a group of organizations the PHSP bring expertise and access to all levels of public health to assist and collaborate with the CDC on public health mission-related priorities. These organizations offer ready access to public health infrastructure (i.e. local, state health departments, boards of health, epidemiologists, public health students and leaders, and public health institutes, etc.) and allow existing capacity to scale up emerging public health initiatives, policies, programs, and activities. The eleven (11) Public Health Systems Partners are as follows:<br />American Public Health Association (APHA)<br />Council on State and Territorial Epidemiologist (CSTE)<br />Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) <br />National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO)<br />National Association of Local Boards of Health (NALBOH) <br />Public Health Foundation (PHF)<br />Association for Maternal and Child Health Promotion (AMCHP)<br />National Network of Public Health Institute (NNPHI)<br />Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB)<br />Task Force for Child Survival and Development (TFCSD)<br />Public Health Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC)<br />This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals. It is believed that these partners serve constituents that are not served by any other national representative organization to meet the minimum needs of the Government and no other source for these services is known at this time. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.320-1, one responsible source (the Partners) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS Code is 519190. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct an expanded competitive procurement. Information furnished shall include enough detailed information to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation. Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results. Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date. If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non-responsive. Refer to Government Numbered Notes #22 (http://cbdnet.gpo.gov/num-note.html). Inquiries may be sent to the attention of the Contracting Specialist: Lawrence McCoy, Phone 770-488-2087, email LMcCoy1@cdc.gov. If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please contact the Team Leader, Vivian S. Hubbs, Phone 770-488-2647, email VHubbs@cdc.gov.</p>

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Period of performance: Twelve (12) months from date of award.

The Laboratory of Population Genetics (LPG) is collaborating in several projects involving genotyping clinical samples for genetic markers involved in cancer susceptibility and in response to cancer treatments. LPG has explored several different current technologies that vary in their DNA requirements and in their ability to generate DNA sequence for genotyping as well as DNA sequencing. 

This research is supported by a number of complex instrument systems, including an Applied Biosytems 3130 Automated Sequencer, an Applied Biosytems 3730XL Automated Sequencer, 2 9700-96Well Sample Modules, and an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System, which require annual preventive maintenance and occasional upgrades and repairs.  These service requirements can only be procured from the manufacturer of the instrument systems in order to: 1) maintain the original instruments guarantees and agreements; 2) be implemented by properly trained staff; and 3) have access to the proper replacement parts and reagents.  This current request follows the original purchase whose warranty expires and has been renewed annually for the current lifetime of the instrument system.  It is anticipated that annual renewals of service contracts will occur each year for the instrument systems.

The Laboratory of Population Genetics (LPG) requires use of these genomic analysis instrument systems for their research efforts.  These automated genomic analysis instruments were designed by Applied Biosystems (AB). They require professional maintenance including scheduled service visits and periodic part replacement. Continuous service requires a renewable service contract.  Applied Biosystems is the only reliable firm that is capable of repairing and maintaining these state-of -the art Applied Biosystems Automated DNA Sequencer, Sequence Detection System, and Thermacycler models.

The manufacturer, Applied Biosystems, has service engineers with the highest qualification for repairing the AB instrument systems. They are specially trained on the latest models of the instrument and instrument software. Applied Biosystems holds multiple patents on these instruments and is the sole source of most of the replacement parts and reagents. Parts of these instruments require special handling which requires the approval of Applied Biosystems to get any warranty replacements. 

Applied Biosystems shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance and repair service for five (5) government-owned instrument systems (1 DNA Analyzer ABI Prism 3130-16; 1 7900HT SEQUENCE DETECTION SYSTEM; 2 9700-96Well, Sample Modules; and 1 DNA Analyzer ABI Prism 3730XL located in the Laboratory of Population Genetics:1) one (1) preventive maintenance inspection; 2) unlimited emergency repair within forty-eight (48) hours of first call; 3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; 4) provide free software upgrades. 5) contractor personnel shall have a minimum of three (3) years specialized factory training within the last five (5) years in order to perform service to these instruments and all primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support person with at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.6) contractor shall provide current software updates to the operating system and shall provide Applied Biosystems parts and accessories if required during service.

It is critical to the continued smooth operation and research of the NCI/CCR that these instrument systems continue to be serviced and maintained according to the manufacturers specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could jeopardize the use of the aforementioned systems and/or the accuracy of the data generated by the systems.   The internal components and mechanisms of these instrument systems are proprietary and Applied Biosystems is the only known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on these instruments. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on February 23, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:barbara.a.weitzel@nws02.usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Seattle</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District (hereinafter referred to as the Corps) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a Modification to Contract No. W912DW-05-C-0016 with Traylor Bros., Inc. to construct a surface seal on the spillway monolith joint in the below normal tailwater section at Chief Joseph Dam (CJD) as described herein.  Chief Joseph Dam is located on the Columbia River near Bridgeport, Washington. The 170-ft head dam consists of a 27-unit powerhouse and 19-bay spillway.  The dam is in the process of replacing the spillway monolith joint seal system consisting of a surface elastomeric and underlying injection grout seal from the spillway tainter gate sill beam to the top of the newly constructed spillway deflectors.  The underlying injection grout seal has now been completed in all monolith joints.  However, because the surface seal material must be applied and allowed to cure in the dry for a minimum of 3 days and the top of the spillway deflectors are normally submerged under 8-feet of normal high tailwater, the construction of the surface seal requires a cofferdam to allow the area to be dewatered for the necessary construction and cure time.  The scope of this sources sought work is construction of the surface seal from El. 779 feet (the top of the deflector) to where the CJD Dam Project personnel completed the upper surface seal (approximately El. 795 ft) on all 19 spillway monolith joints.  Normal high tailwater at CJD is approximately El. 787 ft.  This work is a high priority dam safety issue and must be constructed this year subject to the limitations described in the Requirements Section below.<BR><BR>The in-water work window for this work is July 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009 due to CJDs spill season and temperature requirements of the surface seal material.  (The surface seal must be applied and cured in temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.)  The contractor must be able to develop approvable QC, SSH and Dive safety plans, design and construct a coffer dam and complete the joint seals with in the time constraints listed above.<BR><BR>Work must be conducted with the following limitations:<BR><BR>1) In-water construction is generally limited to 6-days per week (Mon-Sat), 12-hour work days to allow the river to be regulated in off-work hours.<BR><BR>2) The work requires a marine plant because construction from the spillway deck is prohibited due to loading requirements.<BR><BR>The NAICS code is 332312.  The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  <BR><BR>All responses may be sent via e-mail to: sharon.j.gonzalez@usace.army.mil  or mailed to Contracting, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Attention: Sharon Gonzalez, P.O.

This sources sought sysnopsis is to elicit knowledge and perspective on the challenges for the purpose of building a comprehensive and coherent Information Operations and Space Division (IOSD) program capable of realizing the full-scope of Strategy of Active Security (SAS) objectives.  IOSD is interested in better understanding information operations and space operations solutions, the level of interest in industry for conducting this kind of work, and the capabilities interested industry partners may have in this area to help IOSD put together a solid Request for Proposal package.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<BR><BR>The purpose is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualification of contractors to compete and perform the resulting contract.  The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis.  The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors.<BR><BR>The objectives to be performed under the resulting contract will be to provide support to IOSD activities needed to realize the objectives outlined in the SAS.  These activities can be broken down into strategic-, operational-, and tactical-level objectives, effects, tasks, and assessments.  Two major divisions in effort are anticipated across these three levels of activity.  The first division addresses the social sciences aspects of IOSD programs.  These activities would include the development of cultural, economic, religious, geographical, and political implications of targeted audiences in the European Command (EUCOM) area of responsibility (AOR).  Developing appropriate solutions which consider these key social-cultural aspects of key countries in the AOR is a critical element to successful IOSD operations and planning<BR><BR>The second division of effort addresses the technical elements necessary to provide the appropriate capabilities supporting IOSD programs and operations in the EUCOM AOR.  These areas include, but are not limited to, electronic warfare (EW), computer network operations (CNO), and Space applications.  The cross-over points between the levels of interaction and the division of effort provides a framework for better characterizing the planning and operational tasks that are needed in pursuit of the SAS objectives.  While the framework is notional, it serves as a basis on which to begin the dialogue concerning both the scope and depth needed to fully realize SAS objectives.<BR><BR><BR>In short, IOSD is looking for capabilities and good ideas to translate EUCOM SAS-level objectives into implementable conditions and tasks with clear metrics to assess progress toward desired end-states.

Description
AETC CONS/LGCT seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the natural gas distribution system (NAICS 221122) at Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB), Georgia. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the natural gas distribution system at Dobbins ARB, GA and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm CST on Monday, April 13, 2009. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the August 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.     

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the AETC/LGCT Contracting Office.

Dobbins ARB Natural Gas Distribution System:

Natural gas service is provided by Atlanta Gas and Light at a pressure of five (5) pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The gas main passes through a metering station presently located just outside the Main Base entrance on the east side of Cobb Parkway near the Visitors center. This facility is not owned by the USAF and is positioned behind chain-link fencing. All equipment downstream of the meter is presently owned, operated, and maintained by Dobbins ARB personnel. There are five metering points and several additional meters throughout the base.
Natural gas is distributed through approximately 36,000 linear feet of underground pipeline, comprised of polyethylene and steel piping. There are approximately 120 valves and approximately 30 meters connected to the system. The average depth of burial is approximately three (3) feet. The gas main runs north of the Visitors Center and west along the north side of Atlantic Ave. to the Air Force POL facility and along Industrial Drive to Base Civil Engineering.  Black steel lines (two and six-inch Schedule 40 piping) date from the 1950s. Newer PVC lines (two to four-inch HDPE piping) were installed in projects completed from the mid-1990s to 2005. A three-inch black steel gas main that runs on the south side of Atlantic Ave was abandoned after the four-inch HPDE pipe was installed.  An additional four-inch PVC pipe exists on the far southeast side of the base servicing the US Army Reserve Area and Firing Range. Those portions of the system that are owned by Lockheed Martin, by the US Navy, and by the National Guard are excluded from this privatization solicitation. There are no known severe leaks or problems with any gas lines or laterals. Under current DoD direction, meters are to be added to all service locations.

Description
AETC CONS/LGCT seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution system (NAICS 221122) at Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB), Georgia. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the water distribution system at Dobbins ARB, GA and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm CST on Monday, April 13, 2009. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the August 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.     

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the AETC/LGCT Contracting Office.


Dobbins ARB Water Distribution System:

Dobbins ARB receives water from Cobb County Water System and Lockheed-Martin. The Cobb County water supply is delivered via a 16 inch cast iron steel pipe (owned and maintained by Cobb County) located south of the base near the intersection of South Cobb Parkway and Enterprise Way roads. There is no main meter at this point; however all the south base facilities supplied by this 16 inch main have meters. The Lockheed Martin water supply is delivered via an 18-inch main located at Industrial Drive across from Building #530. There is no base water production. This water main supplies both the Main Base and facilities located north of South Cobb Drive. This water main is metered at the point of demarcation (POD) with Lockheed Martin. Another POD is at the west side of the main runway. Lockheed Martin owns and maintains the system north of this point up to their property line. The US Navy owns and maintains the system south of this POD. Those portions of the system that are owned by Lockheed Martin and by the US Navy are excluded from this privatization solicitation. Potable water is distributed through approximately 43,500 linear feet of underground piping, comprised of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), steel, cast iron, ductile iron and fiberglass-reinforced plastic materials. There are approximately 300 valves and approximately 12 meters connected to the system. Facilities such as administration, training, and support are the primary consumers of the potable water. The Dobbins ARB Base Operations and Support Services (BOS) Contractor, DMS, is responsible for operation and maintenance of the base water distribution system. Projects to loop the system have been identified to rectify issues associated with low chlorine residuals. There are no known areas of significant leaks or problems with any main lines or laterals. Under current DoD direction, meters are to be added to all service locations.

Dobbins ARB Wastewater Collection System:

The Dobbins ARB wastewater collection system was installed during base construction in the mid 1940s and discharges into the Cobb County wastewater system. It consists of approximately 41,568 linear feet of piping, and is comprised of reinforced concrete, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and vitrified clay (VCP) material. Both reinforced concrete and brick manholes are present at Dobbins ARB. The only significant modifications to the original construction are approximately 7,000 linear feet of sewer line replaced in 2006 on the north side of the base, and lateral line construction to provide service to buildings added or renovated over time. The mains are a combination of gravity and force, with five lift stations in operation. The system is operated and maintained by Dobbins ARB, and includes areas of the base not currently occupied by Lockheed Martin operations and various Reserve Units. Such Reserve Units include the Army, Navy and Georgia Army National Guard. Those portions of the system that are not owned by Dobbins ARB, such as areas owned by Lockheed Martin, by the US Navy, and by the National Guard, are excluded from this privatization solicitation. The POD for the waste water system begins at a line extending from Buchannan Road, located at the west end of the flight line, down the middle of the flight line, then turning south down the middle of Taxiway Alpha to the Fire Training Area, and east to the base perimeter fence. The Cantonment Area includes only the areas north of this demarcation line not occupied by other tenants. The last manhole manhole camera survey was performed in 1998. There are no known significant leaks or problems associated with the system. The wastewater collection system is generally in fair condition.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for performing aSpace Network Ground Systems (SNGS) sustainment effort.  The SN Ground SegmentSustainment (SGSS) Project, located at NASA GSFC, is planning for the replenishment/replacement of the existing SNGS equipment located at Las Cruces, NM; Blossom Point, MD;and Guam, a U.S. territory.  Overview: The Space Network (SN) consists of a space segment, the Tracking and Data RelaySatellites (TDRS), and a ground segment, the SNGS.  The SN provides the capability forglobal space-to-ground telecommunications and tracking coverage for near Earthspaceflight missions, including both scientific and human space flight.  The functionalobjectives of the SNGS are: 1. maintain health, safety, and control of all TDRSspacecraft;  2. relay customer signals in forward and return directions between theground demarcation points for the NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN) or localinterfaces and customer spacecraft via the TDRS with a very high figure of availabilitythat provides for extremely high operational proficiency;  3. provide tracking servicesfor TDRS and customer spacecraft;  4.  provide SN customers with service planning,scheduling, and status & control of active supports;  5.  provide for the ability tooperate, maintain, and sustain the flight and ground segments; and 6.  provide fortesting, monitoring and fault isolation of the SN assets and systems.  More informationabout the SN can be found at: http://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/sn/index.htm.Background:  The SNGS has been expanded and modified to support an evolving customer basewhile maintaining the fundamental architecture created by the last modernization projectin the mid-1990s.  The SGSS project is beginning planning for the replacement of theexisting SNGS to address issues associated with obsolescence; to create a more flexibleand organic architecture to address evolving customer requirements and advances intechnology; to implement new methods and capabilities for using the TDRS to supportcustomer spacecraft; to expand and improve the methods by which customer control centersinterface with the SNGS for data and service planning and control; and to improve longterm operational performance, reliability and maintainability.Approach:  NASA is seeking sources or teams capable of meeting the functional objectivesof the refurbishment, and address the issues and goals for the implementation of therefurbishment.	The NASA SGSS Project is planning to execute an SGSS procurement to seekindustry proposals for this important effort.  It is anticipated that a singleimplementation contract will be awarded. It is expected that the new system will bedeveloped, integrated and tested at a location geographically separate from the WhiteSands Complex.	The new systems will then be installed and transitioned into operationsat the NASA facilities in Las Cruces, NM; Blossom Point, MD; and Guam.	It is anticipatedthat the mechanical components of the existing Space to Ground Link antennas at thosefacilities could be retained; however, all other RF components and support systems areunder consideration for replacement based on the selected approach.  A specific Statementof Work, Systems Requirements Document, and related documentation relative to theprocurement and implementation, will be provided with the Request For Proposal (RFP). The RFP is expected to be performance based.  The contractor(s) will provide thepersonnel, materials, and facilities necessary to complete the task.  The contractor(s)will need to have expert knowledge and experience related to complex satellitecommunications, with knowledge of the SN in particular.  Specific area of expertiseinclude, but is not limited to, ground system and subsystem architectures;state-of-the-art digital modulation/demodulation techniques and coding schemes; RFamplification; filtering; timing systems; signal combing methods; and distortionsensitivities.	The contractor(s) will need relevant experience with the use ofappropriate analytical tool sets and modeling.	Further, the contractor(s) will needexpert knowledge in software design and implementation for complex and high reliabilitysoftware systems; and the use of appropriate modeling techniques to predict complexity,size, effort, and schedule for development.  It is anticipated that the performing business unit of the Contractor (at a minimum theprime if teaming is anticipated) will be certified to CMMI level 3 by a Certified LeadAuditor.  Knowledge of appropriate commercially available products will be necessary.  Other Information: No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of thesolicitation.  When additional information becomes available, it will be synopsized inFedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov) and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service(http://prod.nais.nasa.gov).  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitorthese sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

A.	INTRODUCTION

The Ensuring Help Arrives Near Callers Employing 9-1-1 Act was signed into law December of 2004.  It called for the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), US Department of Transportation, to create a National E9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (National 9-1-1 Office) to implement its provisions.  47 U.S.C.  942 makes NHTSAs Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) at the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) responsible for the following:
	Improve coordination and communication between Federal, State and local emergency communication systems, emergency personnel, public safety organizations, telecommunications carriers, and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and vendors.
	Develop, collect and disseminate information concerning practices, procedures and technology used in implementation of E9-1-1 services.
	Administration of a grant program specifically for Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs).

The ICO must obtain policy, program, and project input from the broad constituency of transportation and public safety officials who are responsible for public safety, emergency communications and response, and the private sector entities that support their functions.  These include policy and program decision makers, as well as field personnel within a wide range of professional communities: transportation, law enforcement, fire and rescue, Emergency Medical Services, emergency communications, telematics manufacturers and service providers, and State and local governments. Fundamental cultural and institutional differences separate the professional communities involved.  Engaging these essential stakeholders requires a working knowledge of the telecommunications technology and how it is utilized in operating 9 1 1 services.
					
While NHTSA staff has developed some expertise in the areas of 9-1-1 technology and operations, it is in the best interest of the National 9-1-1 Office to acquire, through contract, professional services providing the National 9-1-1 Office with supplemental skills, knowledge and abilities in both 9-1-1 technology and operations.  Technical expertise includes such things as a working knowledge of the technical telecommunications components included in the 9-1-1 system, how they interconnect and how they function.  It also includes a working knowledge of the technical challenges faced by 9-1-1 systems in accommodating advancing technologies such as text messaging, telematics data, photographs and video.  Operational expertise includes a working knowledge of how 9-1-1 services operate, at both the individual Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) level and at the 9-1-1 system level; including but not limited to budgeting, work force issues, protocol development, quality assurance, and policy and legal issues related to the operation of 9-1-1 services.
B.  	PURPOSE

The purpose of this task order is to initiate a contract to provide the National 9-1-1 Office with services as follows:
	Professional technical support for the National 9-1-1 Office
	Professional operational support for the National 9-1-1 Office.
The projected period of performance for the provision of these services is 12 months.

C.	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The contractor shall provide technical and operational support on a full-time, ongoing basis.  The contractor shall develop products and services outlined in this Task Order that meet the requirements of the National 9-1-1 Office as well as all applicable industry standards.  In all instances, these products and services must be developed and completed within strict timeframes, which are established by the Deliverables and Due Dates as described in this Task Order.

The services included do not necessarily require those providing technical support to be housed within the DOT building; but will require regular and frequent travel to DOT if those providing support are not housed within the DOT building.  Those providing support will be required to spend at least one day per week at DOT headquarters and will be expected to provide support remotely on a full-time, ongoing basis.

D.  Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

<DESC>A.  INTRODUCTION

The Ensuring Needed Help Arrives Near Callers Employing 911 Act of 2004 (hereinafter identified as ENHANCE 911 Act or the Act) was signed into law on December 23, 2004.  It called for the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NHTSA to create a national E-911 Implementation Coordination Office (National 9 1 1 Office) to implement the provisions of the Act.  The National 9-1-1 Office is physically housed in the NHTSA Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) and is charged with improving the Nations 9 1 1 system.     The National 9-1-1 Office has three statutory responsibilities:
1.	To increase and improve coordination among Federal, State and local emergency communication systems, emergency personnel, public safety organizations, telecommunications carriers, and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and vendors.
2.	Develop, collect and disseminate information concerning practices, procedures and technology used in implementation of E9-1-1 services.
3.	Administer grant program specifically for Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs).   
To carry out these responsibilities, the National 9-1-1 Office seeks to directly involve constituents in the processes of fulfilling its duties.     

The National 9-1-1 Office must obtain policy, program, and project input from the broad constituency of private industry and public safety officials who are responsible for public safety, incident response and emergency communications. These include policy and program decision makers, as well as field personnel within a wide range of professional communities: transportation, law enforcement, fire and rescue, Emergency Medical Services, emergency communications and telecommunications, informatics, and telematics manufacturers and service providers) and State and local governments. Fundamental cultural and institutional differences separate professional communities.

In addition to seeking program and policy input, the National 9-1-1 Office seeks to raise awareness and educate the public safety community about its programs and products.  The National 9-1-1 Office seeks to promote the expansion and utilization of its successful projects by actively marketing projects of relevance to appropriate stakeholders.  The ultimate success of the projects funded by the National 9-1-1 Office and the utilization and expansion of project results is dependent upon all appropriate stakeholders having awareness and knowledge of these projects and their potential benefits.  Only through actively marketing specific National 9-1-1 Office programs and projects will this level of awareness be realized.

In addition to these general responsibilities, a 9-1-1 Technical Assistance Center (TAC) has been created.  The TAC will be a clearinghouse of 9-1-1 information with links to other information sources and personnel to answer a variety of questions related to 9-1-1 technology and operations.  The National 9-1-1 Office seeks to make the Public Safety Community aware of the existence and purpose of the TAC.  

Current staffing of the National 9-1-1 Office will require contractor support to engage all appropriate stakeholders and raise awareness of its programs and products in a timely manner.  The National 9-1-1 Office seeks professional support services to develop and implement a Strategic Communications Outreach Plan to accomplish these tasks.  

B.	BACKGROUND

As stated above, the National 9-1-1 Office has multiple statutory responsibilities, requiring the involvement of a very broad and disparate group of stakeholders.  In addition, the work to be done is often highly technical and very specific to the operation of 9-1-1 networks and systems.  Past experience with general marketing/public relations companies in providing support services to the National 9-1-1 Office have not been productive, due to the inordinate amount of time required to become even basically familiar with both 9-1-1 technology and the role of each group within the broad 9-1-1 constituency.  It is imperative therefore, that any offeror is able to demonstrate working knowledge of 9-1-1 technology, operations and institutional issues, in order to provide the level of support required by the National 9-1-1 Office.  While extensive experience in working with or as part of a 9-1-1 authority or organization is not required, it is preferred.

The National 9-1-1 Office currently has under contract, the services of an outreach and marketing firm and they are in the process of completing and implementing a comprehensive communications plan.  The contractor under this new proposed contract will be expected to review the existing communications plan and assess the progress made in implementation.  The contractor shall then revise the comprehensive communications plan, to be consistent with activities to date, and to continue and expand outreach and marketing activities as appropriate and as directed by the staff of the National 9-1-1 Office, in conjunction with NHTSAs Office of Communications and Consumer Information. 

The existing communications plan and the most up-to-date progress report on its implementation will be submitted to the Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) when OAM is ready to post this offering for proposals.

C.  PURPOSE

The purpose of this task order is to engage services to provide professional marketing and outreach support for the National 9-1-1 Office.  These services will include the development and implementation of a Strategic Communications Outreach Plan for the National 9-1-1 Office projects and initiatives, and to coordinate and facilitate the required general marketing and outreach activities.  The Contractor shall coordinate with National 9-1-1 Office staff, to develop and maintain active relationships with multiple public and private organizations, and develop and utilize appropriate mechanisms for engaging stakeholders and maintaining their support and awareness of the progress of specific National 9-1-1 Office projects.

D.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall provide onsite services to the National 9-1-1 Office including:
1)	Review of existing communications and outreach plan and assess progress in implementation.  Revision and implementation of revised communications and outreach plan.
2)	Design of supporting print and media support items.
3)	Development of case studies, analysis papers and articles discussing various issues and/or projects as directed by staff of National 9-1-1 Office.

<SUBJECT>Promote and Coordinate Medical Review Guidelines
<SOLNBR>2009-013
<RESPDATE>022709
<CONTACT>Lloyd S. Blackwell, Small Business Specialist, Phone 202-366-9564, Email lloyd.blackwell@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>AGENCY:	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Safety Countermeasures Division (SCD).

ACTION:	Announcement of a request for application to promote and coordinate new medical review guidelines for driver licensing.  This will include providing technical assistance to no fewer than ten States, promoting the guidelines at no fewer than three conferences, seeking opportunities for promoting the guidelines in additional States, and reporting the adoption of the guidelines to the Government.

SUMMARY:  Previously, NHTSA partnered with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) to develop guidelines for driver licensing authorities (DMVs) medical review sections.  The guidelines provide a scientific basis for establishing restrictions for drivers who have impairments of physical function and vision, and neurological disorders that may cause impairments to safe driving.  This partnership with AAMVA was for the purpose of developing the guidelines.  It is now time to promote their adoption by State DMVs.  Driver licensing is a State function and decisions about establishing licensing policies are done at the State level.  By providing these guidelines to States and promoting their adoption by DMVs, NHTSA aims to improve traffic safety, to provide support for DMVs in changing policies, and to limit the burden on medically-impaired drivers to what is necessary to ensure public safety.  This contract will provide technical assistance to States, and specifically State DMVs, to help them adopt the guidelines.

Promote and Coordinate Medical Review Guidelines

As part of SAFETEA-LU, Section 2017 (a), Congress directed NHTSA to enhance the scientific basis for making driver licensing decisions.  Driver licensing authorities (DMVs) across the country do not necessarily have a scientific basis for making licensing decisions regarding drivers who have medical conditions.  For example, each State has its own vision standard that addresses acuity, peripheral vision, and how vision is tested.  The resulting patchwork means that a driver who is presumed safe in one state can be designated unsafe in another on the basis of a vision test.  To address this issue, NHTSA and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) developed a set of policy guidelines for DMV medical review. The guidelines (draft expected in 07/09) address vision, neurological disorders, and physical function.  However, the current project has focused solely on guideline development, not on promotion.

It is important that States adopt the new guidelines in their driver licensing practices and bring driver license practices to a scientifically-based approach.  NHTSA expects that there will be some States that will be early-adopters of the new guidelines, and that other States will be less engaged in making changes to their medical review practices.  Reasons for those States that are less engaged might include fear of additional costs, lack of political permission, or lack of expertise in implementing new guidelines.  The purpose of this procurement is to help the early-adopters change their practices in accordance with the new guidelines and use their experiences to encourage other States to follow their lead.  This project is also designed to help establish political permission in less active States, and to provide technical assistance to a number of States in preparation for adopting the scientifically-based guidelines.

Objective: Encourage adoption of guidelines as licensing policy in all States, with technical assistance provided to the ten most promising States.
General Approach: the contractor shall provide structured marketing of newly-released medical review guidelines through newsletters, e-mail blasts, AAMVA conferences, and trade magazines.  Further, the contractor shall identify the 10 states that are most likely to adopt some or all of the guidelines as licensing policy and provide technical support to those States in their efforts to adopt the guidelines.

Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

<SUBJECT>Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Follow-up Study

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH is interested in identifying institutions with the capability to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC) for its Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) follow-up study. The project title is ACCORDION.
ACCORD Trial (Background and Purpose): 

About 24 million people (almost 8% of the U.S. population) have diabetes, which costs the nation an estimated $174 billion annually.  People with type 2 diabetes have 2-4 times the rate of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to those without diabetes.  With increasing diabetes rates in the nation, the attributable risk of CVD due to diabetes is increasing.
The goal of the ACCORD trial is to address this public health challenge by testing three complementary medical treatment strategies to enhance the options for reducing CVD rates in people with diabetes.  ACCORD is a randomized, multicenter, factorially designed clinical trial in 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus conducted in 77 academic, VA, and non-academic clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada.  The current infrastructure comprises 7 clinical networks, a Data Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, an ECG Reading Center, and a Drug Distribution Center.   The trial has been ongoing since September 30, 1999.
ACCORD participants had to be adults at high risk for a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event by having clinical CVD, subclinical CVD, or at least 2 additional CVD risk factors in addition to Type 2 diabetes. The trial was designed to test the effects on major CVD events of a therapeutic strategy to control glycemia to near-normal levels (target HbA1c < 6%) compared with standard control (HbA1c 7.0-7.9%), of fibrates to increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides compared with placebo in the context of good LDL-C control by statins, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP< 120 mmHg) compared with standard control (SBP<140 mmHg). All 10,251 participants are in the glycemia trial; 5,518 are in the lipid trial and 4,733 are in the BP trial. The primary outcome for all 3 trials is first occurrence of a major CVD event (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death).
ACCORD includes substudies on the investigation of the effects of diabetes on cognitive functioning and brain magnetic resonance imaging (the MIND substudy); on retinopathy and its progression over time, (the EYE substudy); and a Health Quality of Life and Cost-effectiveness substudy.  
In February 2008, the intensive glycemia strategy was stopped early after a mean 3.5 years of treatment because of a significant 22% higher all-cause mortality rate compared with the standard strategy group; in contrast, there was a non-statistically significant 10% reduction in the composite primary outcome of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death [NEJM 358:2545, 2008]. Intensive group participants were transitioned to the standard treatment strategy until the end of the scheduled follow-up; the BP and lipid trials continue as planned.  
Due to the unexpected findings from the intensive glycemia strategy results and evidence from other studies that beneficial effects of glucose (and other risk factors) control on CVD risk may take years to develop, it is important to follow the ACCORD participants to examine post-trial patterns and outcomes.  The impact of ACCORD on the treatment of patient with type 2 diabetes will continue to expand as analyses of the rich database from the main trial and, importantly, an observational follow up phase, are presented and published.  
ACCORDION (The ACCORD Follow-Up Study):  
A 5-year observational ACCORD follow-up (ACCORDION) from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015 is planned.  During ACCORDION all ACCORD participants would be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up measurement. An estimated 92% of the original 10,251 participants are anticipated to be available for follow-up, based on current numbers of deaths, losses-to-follow-up, and refusals.  The goal is to have all available ACCORD participants included in ACCORDION, even if the current clinical site is unable to participate.   
The goal of ACCORDION is to obtain key clinical data that are similar in quality to those obtained during the trial period to enable examination of trends over time.  Examining morbidity and mortality from both macrovascular and microvascular diseases will provide a complete picture regarding long-term vascular outcomes from diabetes and the impact of glucose, blood pressure lowering, and lipid treatment on those outcomes.
ACCORDION would have regular clinic visits for data collection and interim phone contacts to obtain information about clinical events.  Clinic visits would use streamlined approaches from current methods to obtain key clinically relevant data that are the most important measures for the glycemia, BP, and lipid trials. Information to be collected would be detailed by investigators but is envisioned as including the following:  BP; medications; blood for HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, lipids, and creatinine; and urine for creatinine and albumin. As currently, a Central Laboratory would conduct specimen analyses, ECGs would be obtained to identify silent myocardial infarctions, and clinical events would be centrally adjudicated. A specific protocol will be developed upon award. 
It is anticipated that other Agencies or NIH Institutes currently supporting ACCORD substudies will continue supporting the continuation of those substudies in ACCORDION, as an observational follow-up for those substudies would also contribute important clinical information for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes.
Potential Offerors for the Coordinating Center award should demonstrate experience and expertise in the following areas:
1.	Providing leadership to obtain a high level of retention and high-quality accurate measurement of key clinical variables in 10,000 study participants at over 70 sites across the United States and Canada.

Following sufficient build up test flights, this demonstration will culminate in one or more flight tests of the ASDRS as part of the Navys X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS-D) Autonomous Aerial Refueling (AAR) demonstration program.  The ASDRS shall be compatible with the current ARS design and operating envelope, including the transfer of fuel, demonstrating system performance and robustness in various probe and drogue (P&D) aerial refueling scenarios.

SCHEDULE
Award of an ASDRS demonstration program contract is expected 2nd QTR FY 2010, with the goal of successfully completing Safety of Flight/Airworthiness qualification no later than the 4th QTR FY 2011 (earlier is preferred).  It is anticipated that the integration asset(s) will be delivered no later than 3rd QTR FY 2011.  Following that, the program is expected to successfully demonstrate the stabilized drogue operation with manned F/A-18 receiver aircraft no later than 1st QTR FY 2012 and be ready for demonstration with the X-47B receiver no later than 4th QTR FY 2012.  The Government will require the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support Flight Clearance in the 2nd QTR FY2011 timeframe.

DEMONSTRATION OBJECTIVES
1)	Develop and integrate an Airworthy ASDRS into the existing ARS system on the F/A-18E/F platform that will support both manned and unmanned refueling demonstrations.  
2)	Demonstrate reduction of drogue motion bandwidth (frequency and amplitude) as compared to a standard drogue at F/A-18 E/F NATOPS representative aerial refueling tracks, altitudes and airspeeds under atmospheric conditions encountered during demonstration.  Under these conditions, the ASDRS shall support repeated, successful plugs by surrogate and X-47B receiver aircraft.  Moderate turbulence conditions, if not demonstrated in flight, shall be demonstrated via analysis.
3)	Demonstrate accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability of the drogue position sensing function relative to the tanker (integrity, continuity and availability are demonstrated by analysis with verification of assumptions via flight test).
4)	Demonstrate ability of the drogue stabilization function to hold the drogue relative to a predetermined point (nominally the natural trail point of the drogue), including compensating for biases such as those caused by receiver forebody effects and other disturbances such as turbulence, tanker-induced motion, etc.
5)	Support safe and effective demonstration with multiple probe and drogue refueling systems/ operations (manned and unmanned), to include the transfer of fuel with: 
	Probe-equipped Navy aircraft (piloted refueling)
	Probe-equipped UAS Surrogate such as an F/A-18 C/D (automatic control refueling)
	X-47B (autonomous refueling)
6)	Optional Objectives
	Ability to integrate the ASDRS into other drogue-equipped tanker systems (such as commercial Omega tankers) to support demonstration
	Consideration of stabilization modes for the ASDRS (e.g., inertial vs tanker body stabilization, considerations of wing-mounted systems, compensation for tanker motion)

DESIGN/ TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
1)	Integration Objectives
a.	Adapts to ARS hose end and tailcone (stowage tunnel) without modification to the ARS.  Minor modifications to the stowage tunnel (for drogue stowage) and to the ARS exterior (for sensor apertures) may be allowable, if the impact is minimized. 
b.	Supports integration of the ARS with the F/A-18E/F, including additional data interface and control functions as required to support the demonstration
c.	Equivalent aerodynamic performance (drag, stability, extension, retraction) over the same or greater envelope as the current ARS.  ARS system shall not require design/performance modifications to incorporate stabilized drogue.
d.	Capable of providing relative drogue positioning information at the receiver aircraft via installation of sensors on the receiver aircraft (design capable; not part of this effort)
2)	Performance Objectives
a.	Design capable of continuous operation  neither mission endurance nor turnaround time shall be limited by power available on the ASDRS. 
b.	Reduced drogue motion bandwidth to less than 10 cm, 2 sigma at frequencies of 0.7 Hz or less at altitudes of 1500 to 30,000 ft in conditions up to and including moderate turbulence.
c.	System availability (via analysis and demonstration) of 98% or greater
d.	Maintain constant receiver sight picture
e.	Drogue position sensing technique supports Low Probability of Intercept/ Low Probability of Detection.
f.	Maintainability and reliability shall be an inherent consideration in the design.  Although the demo design is not intended to be production-representative, there shall be a clear path from the demo design to an operational system.
3)	Interface Objectives
a.	Architecture shall be compatible with manned receiver aircraft and X-47B receiver.   
b.	Data from drogue position sensing system and integrity information shall support network interface at the tanker for transmission to the receiver
c.	External data interfaces support open architecture, non-proprietary data exchanges
d.	Design shall meet North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement STANAG 3447 requirements for the probe/drogue interface
4)	Safety Objectives
a.	Operation of the ASDRS should reduce probability of failed engagement and drogue fuselage strike for manned and unmanned operations
b.	The controlling mechanism and sensor package (actuators, sensor apertures, etc) shall minimize susceptibility to strike/impact damage
c.	The ASDRS shall be designed to minimize Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD) probability.  
d.	Integrity to detect when the system should not be used with the control system enabled
e.	Integrity to detect when the drogue positioning information is invalid (Performance estimation and Fault detection functions) 
f.	Capability to be safely used in a system off state for both manned and unmanned receivers.
g.	Capability to be used with the position sensing function only (active stabilization disabled)
h.	Safe failure/ degraded modes of control system operation
i.	Indication shall be made to the external interface (tanker) when the ASDRS system determines the refueling operation should be discontinued.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2.  The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting a market survey to achieve cruise missile defense at extended ranges.  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is interested in receiving information on a low-cost interceptor that will be complementary to the current Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) interceptor, will require no development or modification to achieve integration with existing SLAMRAAM launchers, is compatible with the current Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.  System maturity should support entering an Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) program with critical technologies at no less than Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6 as of 01 October 2011 with no additional developmental funding from the Government to attain TRL6.  Candidate missile systems must be able to counter the primary threat set of CMs and tactical UAVs out to ranges of 30 KM in all types of weather. They must also have capability against the secondary threat set of rotary wing (RW) and fixed wing (FW) aircraft. (A representative composite threat matrix is provided in Annex 7.)  Annexes will be provided only to US based and owned companies.  Interested responders must request the AMRDEC ANNEXES in writing or via e-mail.  After validation by the AMRDEC security office of each interested responders security accreditation and eligibility to receive the AMRDEC ANNEXES a complete copy of the AMRDEC ANNEXES will be sent to each validated responder.  The primary focus of this effort is to obtain a low-cost, complementary SLAMRAAM interceptor.  Our interest lies in an interceptor with a production target price of $200,000 but not more than $450,000 for a 1000 missile lot size.  Average Unit Production Cost (AUPC) should be considered the primary driver.  Interceptor development and integration costs, schedule, and TRL maturity path should be provided to include development costs, integration cost and cost per interceptor AUPC for quantities of 500, 1000, and 2000.  Manufacturing readiness levels (MRL) should also be provided.  As part of the cost inputs, respondents should include complete acquisition timeline to include milestones within EMD such as Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR).  Include life cycle cost considerations assuming a shelf life of 10 years.  Annex 4 contains information requested to support cost data needed.  Annex 9 contains definitions of the Manufacturing Readiness Levels ( MRLs).  Annex 10 contains definitions of the TRLs.  There will be no fire control sensor development effort in connection with this interceptor.  The Future Interceptor will utilize existing IAMD radars.  Typical Target Cueing Radar Capabilities are located in Annex 8.  Respond with seeker hand-over volume capabilities for each threat.  There is no Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) development envisioned as part of this effort.  The system will be a part of the existing Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Architecture.  Candidate missile systems must be fully compatible with the current SLAMRAAM launcher without modification.  If the concept is compatible with other existing launchers, such as Non-Line-of-Sight Launcher System (NLOS-LS), or High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), then the respondent should articulate the additional launcher capability, performance impacts, and costs associated with use on the other launcher platforms as part of the SLAMRAAM system.  Respondents should present their best candidate solution to this requirement.  In this process, present the candidate system that can engage the composite threat matrix, meet the cost targets, and discuss any tradeoffs in performance required to meet these cost targets.  A summary of the desired requirements are listed.  Performance Parameter  Cost; Characteristic - $200-$450K (objective); At a production quantity of 1000; Performance Parameter - Intercept Range; Characteristic - 30+KM (objective); Performance Parameter - Load (Missiles per Launcher) ; Characteristic -4 (threshold); 6+(objective) on SLAMRAAM Launcher; Performance Parameter - Weight; Characteristic -Not to exceed (NTE) 350 lb (Threshold=Objective); Performance Parameter - Command Destruct; Performance Parameter - Lock On After Launch; Performance Parameter - Insensitive Munition (IM) Compatible; Performance Parameter - Uses Existing SLAMRAAM Launcher System; Performance Parameter Integrated Battlefield Control System (IBCS) Compatible.<BR>The objective of this process is to assess current and working prototype products and technologies within the United States Department of Defense (DoD) industrial base capable of achieving the characteristics listed above.  Respondents are requested to submit interceptor modeling parameters (Annex 1), interceptor seeker parameters (Annex 2 or 3), lethality parameters (Annex 4), and cost parameters (Annex 5).  The government requests invitation to these component-level hardware demonstrations as part of the response to this RFI to more fully understand vendor capabilities.   Hardware demonstrations should support concept performance claims that are presented in the chart and annex submittals.

<DESC>This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.<BR><BR>Description:  Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5B; NSN 1370-01-523-4694 (L119); P/N 200425104-10.  The technical data package is Distribution C.  The Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5B is used by downed airmen or others exposed to emergency escape and evasion situations.  The kit includes a hand fired launcher and a bandoleer assembly.  The bandoleer assembly contains a plastic molded bandoleer holding seven red signals.  The signals consist of small solid propellant rocket motors actuated by a percussion primer, a delay element, and a pyrotechnic candle in a metal case.  The surface of the metal case is dyed red to match the color of the candle.  The launcher is black anodized aluminum; it has a retaining device and a firing mechanism.  The retaining device precludes the signal from falling out of the launcher when the loaded launcher is aimed vertically at the ground.  The firing mechanism consists of a free traveling firing pin with an actuation knob and spring.  The launcher is connected to the bandoleer by a lanyard.  Physical dimensions for the launcher are Length 5.5 in.; Diameter 0.8 in.  Signals are loaded individually into the launcher with nozzle down into the launcher until the signal bottoms out.  The firing pin inside the launcher upon firing, strikes the primer in the signal which ignites the propellant.  Exhaust gases are expelled through nozzle holes in the signal and propel the flare out of the launcher in a spin stabilized flight.  The signal should be able to completely penetrate moderately dense jungle or forest foliage.  After traveling approximately 600 feet, the payload ignites causing separation from the rocket motor.  Burn time is approximately 9 seconds and provides an average candle power value of 2,500 lumens for the first 7 seconds.  Physical dimensions for the signal are Length 2 in.; Diameter 0.5 in.<BR><BR>There are three major components to be manufactured: the launcher, the flare, and the bandolier. <BR>The complete launcher consists of 6 separate pieces. The launcher body consists of 2 pieces of aluminum bar which are turned and drilled on a lathe to the specified dimensions. One piece has threads cut at both ends to screw into the second piece and also hold the flare retainer. A groove is milled in the side to allow travel of the striker pin. The second piece has threads cut into it and then cross-hatching marks are knurled into a portion of the handle. The parts are then anodized with a black color. The Striker Pin assembly is a stainless steel rod which is turned on a lathe to the proper dimensions, drilled, and tapped to accept a stainless steel knob.  The flare retainer has four grooves milled 90 degrees apart and a stainless steel spring (commercial item).  The pieces are assembled with a light lubricant placed on the striker to complete the launcher.  <BR><BR>The flare assembly has two parts; the rocket motor and the flare grain.  The rocket motor consists of a stainless steel body, spacer, foil seal, nozzle, o-ring, primer, propellant grain and delay column.  The body and spacer are fabricated from stainless steel by turning and drilling on a lathe to the specified dimensions and the body is heat treated to meet the tensile strength requirements.  The nozzle is turned on a lathe with the center drilled out to accept a primer. Two cone shaped exhaust ports are drilled at an angle to the center axis 180 degrees apart.  Assembly starts with the delay column mix pressed into the end of the rocket motor. The propellant grain is inserted in the other end followed by the spacer and ignition powders.  The primer is then pressed into the nozzle, roll crimped, and sealed with varnish followed by foil placement on the opposite side with a hole pierced through the center for passage of primer flame/gas.  The o-ring is installed and the nozzle assembly is inserted into the rocket motor body and roll-crimped in place.<BR><BR>The flare tube is produced from a sheet of aluminum by a deep drawing process (similar to the way a soda can is formed) then anodized or painted red.  A paper tube is inserted; the flare composition is measured and pressed into the cavity.  The loaded flare tube is then pressed over the end of the rocket motor which completes the entire assembly.<BR><BR>The bandolier is made of injection molded, low density polyethylene plastic.  This process is commercially available.<BR><BR>The critical components are atomized magnesium powder, black powder, and a Nammo Talley proprietary propellant grain.  Critical skills include the ability to handle hygroscopic materials and handle, formulate, and press pyrotechnic mixtures.<BR><BR>Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability.  Please indicate your business size in your response.  Interested companies should provide 1-shift and maximum shift monthly production quantities (and if manufacturing resources are shared with other item/production lines).  Please include a list of qualified suppliers for the components; black powder, magnesium powder, solid propellant rocket motor, and the percussion primer.  Additionally, it is requested that offerors provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production.  Interested companies should also include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit price.  The estimated annual production quantities are between 12,000 and 24,000 units, deliverable from FY10  FY14.<BR><BR>Interested parties have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item.  Any response to this market research should reference the following: Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5B  W52P1J-09-R-0082.

<DESC>A/V write up for Sources-Sought<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing this Sources-Sought Announcement to request submission from Audio/Visual (A/V) and/or interactive media and/or hardware/integration firms who may be potentially interested in a contract for the production of audiovisual film, interactive media, and associated hardware and integration for the National Museum of the United States Army (NMUSA) to be located in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The NMUSA will be the premier military museum of the U.S. Army and the capstone of the Army Museum System. The vision and mission of the NMUSA is to educate, excite, inspire and entertain visitors of all ages on the history and culture of the U.S. Army. <BR><BR>The NMUSA will be a new building housing world class exhibits that use interactive features and multimedia presentation to tell the story of the Army and the soldier. The Museum will preserve, study, and interpret Army material culture, educate Army personnel in the history, traditions, and accomplishments of their profession, provide a research and development base for new military equipment, and train Army museum personnel. The NMUSA building and campus will be constructed in phases and will initially consist of a 155,000 gross square foot facility that houses approximately 50,000 net square feet of exhibit galleries including a theatre. Throughout the exhibition spaces, there will be approximately 45 Audio/Visual and interactive media pieces. The estimated cost of all pieces, including associated hardware and integration, is over $10,000,000. Media descriptions, content development, exhibit integration and treatments are currently being developed for the Audio/Visual and interactive media pieces. Audio/Visual pieces could include approximately 20 to 25 film and video pieces of varying lengths from 1 to 2 minute pieces, 3 to 5 minute pieces, 6 to 8 minute pieces and a signature piece. Some pieces could have multiple screens or projections onto different surfaces. To get a sense of scale and complexity of audio/visual pieces, the following is an example of a signature piece being considered. The signature audio/visual piece could be approximately 15 minutes in length and will serve as the introduction to the NMUSA. The signature piece would be shown in a theatre with high-impact theatrical and media production techniques to bring key concepts and messages to life for visitors of all ages. It is expected that the installed signature production would use stunning visual design, immersive sound and seamless integration of projected video, programmed lighting and/or scenic elements to create an unforgettable experience for visitors to the NMUSA. Approximately 15 to 20 computer interactive pieces are planned for the NMUSA and could include multi-monitors with touch-screen or motion detection technology to enhance the visitor experience to the NMUSA. To get a sense of scale and complexity of interactive pieces, the following are two types of pieces being considered. One example of a major interactive piece could include a projected timeline with several interactive stations featuring multiple monitors allowing a visitor to access multiple topics or multiple aspects of a particular subject simultaneously. Another example of a major interactive piece could be an expansive table surface, large enough for several users, to have either a unique interactive experience or allows simultaneous use for a group experience. <BR><BR>Capabilities of the Audio/Visual and/or interactive media firm should include but are not limited to: project management, script writing, media production, and hardware and integration. The NAICS codes for this procurement is 512110 with a size standard of $29,500,000. Parties interested in providing services for the NMUSA project should submit a written notice to this office outlining your capabilities and experience providing services comparable to those described herein.

Were any of the projects described above for museums or similar public and/or education facilities? If yes, please describe.<BR><BR>4. Is your company specialized in producing museum/documentary-quality films? If yes, what is the size (production cost and duration of film/s) of your largest contract for a museum-type facility?<BR><BR>5. Is your company experienced with creating both media storyboards and scripts? Describe experience.<BR><BR>6. Are you interested in a single contract for audio/visual (film production, hardware, and integration) and interactive media (production, hardware, and integration)?<BR><BR>7. If interested in a single contract, is your preferred involvement as Prime Contractor or subcontractor?<BR><BR>8. Would your company be interested in this procurement if the package includes ONLY film production and associated hardware and integration? If so, would you be more likely to bid as a Prime Contractor or as part of a teaming arrangement?<BR><BR>9. Would your company be interested in this procurement if the package includes ONLY production of interactive media and associated hardware and integration? If so, would you be more likely to bid as a Prime Contractor or as part of a teaming arrangement?<BR><BR>10.

<DESC>The Government is seeking sources for the fabrication and delivery and installation of a quantity of small platforms to attach to shock absorbing concrete (SACON) structures to support portable target lifters for presentation in windows and wall tops.  SACON is typically 24-30 inch thick, poured concrete and is assembled to replicate buildings in urban training settings.  The target lifters are battery powered and remote controlled to alternately expose and hide cardboard or fiberglass man-sized silhouette targets.  There is a requirement for protecting the lifting mechanism from ricochets, splash and errant rounds while exposing the targets in a realistic manner.  Mounting the platforms below the bottom of the window and below the level of the wall tops allows the SACON to accomplish this protection.  A total of 40 target platforms are required and are described below.
Window Platform: a mounting platform with minimum dimensions 32" wide X 30" deep with the ability to bolt a stationary infantry target lifter onto its surface.  The platform shall be affixed to a window opening locating the platform below the window opening at a minimum of 12 inches.  Overall height of the platform mounting bracket shall not exceed 34".  The SIT holder shall be height adjustable over a 6 inch range of vertical movement.  The platform shall remain solid when the target is presented and lowered.  The floor of the platform shall be wire or expanded metal with drainage openings not exceeding 1.5" and capable of allowing " bolts to be installed through it.  The platform shall be capable of supporting 150 lbs.  All materials shall be primed and painted gray or sand in color.  A total of 30 window platforms are required.Top-Wall Platforms: a wall mounted platform with minimum dimensions 32" wide X 30" deep with the ability to bolt a SIT target onto its surface.  The platform shall be affixed to the top of a wall and the floor of the platform shall sit below the top of the wall at a minimum of 12 inches.  The SIT holder shall be height adjustable over a 6 inch range of movement vertically.  The platform shall remain solid when the target is presented and lowered.  The floor of the platform shall be wire or expanded metal with drainage openings not exceeding 1.5" and capable of allowing " bolts to be installed through it.  The platform shall be capable of supporting 150 lbs.  All materials shall be primed and painted gray or sand in color.  A total of 10 top-wall platforms are required.
The award will be approximately $33,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.

<DESC>The Government is seeking sources for the procurement, delivery and installation of a steel-backed, ballistic rubber wall to be installed in front of the target mechanisms on the MCAS Yuma AZ pistol range to prevent damage from errant rounds.  The existing front wall is made of wooden timbers protected by sandbags and is inefficient and unsafe.
The MCAS Yuma pistol range has a walkway down the center line so actually there will be a left side and right side wall, each about 60 feet long.  The contractor shall install the ballistic rubber walls backed with steel on an existing concrete slab.  The height of each wall is about 30 inches across the width of the range.  The steel backing shall be at least 3/8 inch thick and be of Brinell hardness of AR 450 or greater.  The steel must come within an inch of the top of the ballistic rubber and at no point be exposed above the rubber.  A single thickness of rubber block and steel is considered sufficient to defeat pistol rounds of .45 caliber and below. The walls must have bracing appropriate to preclude being knocked over by personnel or range maintenance equipment.  All bracing must not be exposed to the shooters to prevent any ricochet hazards.  Ballistic rubber blocks are commonly available from several commercial vendors often under the brand name DuraBloc.  They are ! normally 9-12 inches thick and are available in a variety of lengths and widths.  The contractor shall remove the existing front wall prior to installation of the ballistic rubber wall.  Materials generated from this removal will be placed in bins provided by the Government and disposal of those materials will be the responsibility of the government.  
The award will be approximately $50,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice.

Through their Intelligent pharmacy network, they provide connectivity to over 90% of the pharmacies throughout the United States and transact over 80% of all electronic pharmacy claims. No other vendor possesses real-time connectivity assets and capabilities of this scope. As a result, NDCHealth is the only vendor capable of fulfilling CDC's requirements to deliver antiviral prescription data from a minimum of 30,000 unique pharmacies with over 400,000 unique antiviral prescription claims every 4 hours from time of dispense. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.320-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies are services will satisfy agency requirements.

<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of 7530-01-033-8891, Paper, Copying, Xerographic Process White 3-Hole Punched 8 1/2 X 11 by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<p>The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, New York, NY</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Paper, Copying, Xerographic Process White 3-Hole Punched 8 1/2 X 11 Inches to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>HAM-86702</p>
<p>CAS-054901-P</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than Friday, February 27, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>

<DESC>The current Federal Telecommunications System 2001 (FTS2001) Long Distance Crossover Contract with AT&T Corporation (GS00T01AHD0002) will expire at midnight on February 27, 2009.  This notice is to advise that the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, for continued performance for a 16-month period beginning February 28, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010. The estimated dollar value is $166M.  This contract is authorized under FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source, and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements).  The incumbent is in place, operational and able to provide the services during this interim period with full system implementation without interruption and degradation.  The agency cannot perform its mission during this interim period nor can it tolerate the disruption to its customer agencies.  The interim period encompasses the time needed for agencies to complete the fair opportunity process under the Networx Program, and the period required to complete any transition from FTS2001 to Networx.  The contract is necessary to allow sufficient time to implement transition and phase out the existing contract.  This is not a formal solicitation.  The Government does not require individual acknowledgement by potential respondents.

Purpose:  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, VA, and the Program Executive Office, Land Systems (PEO LS) Program Manager, Quantico, VA, will host an Industry Day conference on 09 March 2009 at the Gray Research Center, Quantico, VA to provide an overview of the Vehicle Common Display (VCD) requirement. 
The VCD Industry Day is follow-on to RFI M6785408I5069 in which the government requested information from industry on commercial-off-the-shelf solutions that would provide a VCD capability to command, control, and display multiple subsystems from a single user interface. 
Industry will be provided an opportunity to ask questions about the program and the intended future solicitation. The intent of the Industry Day is to provide advance information about the program to Industry and obtain feedback to assist MARCORSYSCOM with structuring a future solicitation. 
Background:  MARCORSYSCOM is tasked to serve as the Commandant of the Marine Corps' (CMC) principal agent for acquisition and sustainment of systems and equipment used by the operating forces to accomplish their war-fighting mission. MARCORSYSCOM manages acquisition throughout the entire product life cycle, to include post fielding operational support. 
PEO LS Marine Corps is the Corps' first PEO and is comprised of eight weapons systems programs. PEO LS is a separate command, reporting directly to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research Development and Acquisition (ASN RDA). PEO LS maintains an integral relationship with Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) (http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil) that leverages infrastructure, competencies and technical authority.
PEO LS manages a diverse program management portfolio which includes the Marine Corps' largest ground acquisition program, the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). The versatility of PEO LS is reflected in two command and control (C2) programs: Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) and Ground-Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR). Also included are ground programs such as the Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), Lightweight 155mm Towed Howitzer (LW 155), Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC). The monetary value of these programs across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is approximately $8.3 billion.
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) tactical (HMMWV, MTVR, LVSR, MRAP, ITV) and combat (AAV, LAV, EFV, Tanks) vehicle programs are facing problems with limitations in size, weight, power, human factors, and safety related to the proliferation of GFE electronics systems being integrated into their vehicle platforms. Each new electronics system requires its owndisplay/monitor/control panel, taking significant Size, Weight and Power (SWAP) budget and impacting safe and effective operation of the vehicles. 
Requirement:  MARCORSYSCOM and PEO LS are interested in pursuing commercial-off-the-shelf solutions for a consolidated vehicle common display technology that can accept and effectively display input in multiple formats/interfaces from vehicle electronics systems (health monitoring systems, sensor systems, situational awareness systems, communication systems, weapons systems, routers, etc.) and, where required, allow control of those systems from the common display. 
The overall goal is to limit displays to no more than one (1) per crew/occupant position. The desired display units should: 1) be configurable to permit viewing and control of any input system; 2) be configurable to allow monitoring multiple systems simultaneously; 3) havedisplays that are identical and interchangeable between positions; 4) be based on flat screen technology (LCD, plasma, or similar); 5) allow for connection through multiple types of data connectors, and accept inputs from analog and digital data and video signals; 6) have the ability to display multi-format video input formats possessing disparate resolution formats (VGA, SVGA, XGA, SXGA, etc.); 7) be based on varying software languages, 8) include an anti-glare or filtering system to allow for viewing in direct sunlight, and brightness control for viewing through Night Vision Goggles; 9) be ruggedized and sealed to resist damage or degradation while operating in typical USMC environments (salt fog, salt spray, dirt, mud, etc.); 10) require minimal power to mitigate vehicle power demand; and 11) have a touch screen or other method for users to input data and/or control systems/applications which is operable in MOPP IV and Cold Weather Gear.

1.0	STATEMENT OF WORK

1.1	General Description

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) was informed by U.S. Bank that HUD is entitled to funds from the Public Facility Loan Trust Account.  U.S. Bank informed HUD that it was entitled to receive approximately $45 million, although that estimate has since changed.  In September 2006, U.S. Bank engaged Denlin Associates, Inc. to perform an audit covering the period 8/30/88 through 9/30/06.  HUD needs to confirm the accuracy and thoroughness of these funds by hiring an independent accounting firm to review the books, records and to determine the amount due and owing to the government at this time.  We also need to determine the current balance based on activity since 9/30/06 as well as an analysis on the 88 issues of bearer Bonds representing the underlying loans held by the Trust.

1.2	 Background

Congress established the Public Facilities Loan Program (PFLP) in 1955 to provide low-interest financial assistance to small municipalities in the construction of public works such as water, sewer, hospital and other public facilities.  The PFLP was terminated in 1975 but projects in process at the time were permitted to be funded at the time they came to fruition.

In January 1987, HUD offered a loan repurchase program applicable to the PFLP loans (the 1987 Loan Repurchase Program) under which borrowers that were current in their loan payments were given the opportunity to repurchase such loans in full and at discounts from their outstanding balances on or before May 29, 1987.  HUD realized gross receipts of approximately $8.4 million from 52 borrowers having an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $9.9 million.  The 1987 Loan Repurchase Program ended on May 29, 1987 and no similar program subsequently has occurred or presently is contemplated.  No loan has any prepayment thereof pending.

HUD was directed by OMB (by letter dated March 21, 1988) to sell loans from its portfolio of PFLP loans (the Portfolio) in fiscal year 1988, in order to meet Federal outlay reduction targets and certain Federal credit management goals.  On August 29, 1998, HUD sold 1,196 loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $271,950,000 to the Public Facility Loan Trust (the Trust) for a purchase price equal to $174,663,564, which represented net proceeds from the sale of the loans equal to $172,762,791 plus accrued interest of $1,900,773, and certificates evidencing ownership of the two classes of beneficial interests in the net assets of the Trust.  The Trust issued four classes of sequential pay bonds on August 29, 1988, with an aggregate par value of $235,958,000 on that date, using the loans as collateral.

The Trust is a closed-end, diversified management investment company organized in order to engage solely in the activities of issuing Bonds and certificates, acquiring the collateral and certain related transactions.  Shawmut Bank, N.A. was trustee (the Owner Trustee) on behalf of the Trust.  The Trust was organized as a special purpose business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to a declaration of trust (the Declaration of Trust) executed and filed by the Owner Trustee with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on July 8, 1988.  
 
1.3	 Objective

To conduct an Agreed-Upon Procedures Audit (Audit), for the purpose of determining the amount of money now due to the government.  

Specifically identify each transaction (including identifying the payor/payee and type of transaction).  Fully describe the PFLT accounts and their relationship to HUD along with confirming amounts from the beginning of the Trust accounts to present day.  Reflect the excess or shortage by period and the accumulated total of such.  Isolate the cause of any excesses and shortages relative to the dividend payment periods.

Also, analyze the existence of 88 issues of municipal bearer Bonds representing the underlying loans held by the Trust.  Provide a thorough breakdown of the bearer Bonds value from its inception until present day.

Upon completion of the Audit a workbook containing the findings must be created.  The workbook must contain all of the transactions as well as the auditors analysis.  Any problems or discrepancies must be identified along with a recommended action or disposition.

1.4	 Scope

The scope of services for this action is limited to providing CPD assistance with respect to the funding required to hire an outside accounting firm for conducting the necessary Audit of the Public Facility Loan Trust Account.  

The auditor is required to provide HUD with access to all books, accounts, records, reports, files, etc. pertaining to their receipt and use of HUDs funds.  These provisions also apply to any sub-recipient of the funds, including contractors and subcontractors.  The actual scope of services will cover the administrative and program controls and activities of the auditing firm, their contracted administrative agents or sub-recipients, or ultimate beneficiaries of the funds.

The Audit must include a review of the laws that established the PFLT and why the program was terminated.  A thorough examination of the audit conducted by Denlin Associates, Inc. on September 2006 must be conducted.  In addition to covering the period reviewed by Denlins audit, a further breakdown of the period covering the date of that audit to the present.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.
Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.
Registered in the CCR database means that
(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record Active. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.
(b) 
(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS+4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offerors name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.
(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number
(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or
(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
(i) Company legal business name.
(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
(iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.
(iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).
(v) Company telephone number.
(vi) Date the company was started.
(vii) Number of employees at your location.
(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
(ix) Line of business (industry).
(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).
(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.
(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g) (1) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Bosnia and Herzegovina in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement completion contract to implement a three-year plus two-year option program entitled the Fostering Interventions for Rapid Market Advancement (FIRMA).
Under the planned activity, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) seek to provide technical assistance and/or services to increase sustainable economic growth and employment in three sectors by impacting the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the implementation of this program entitled Fostering Interventions for Rapid Market Advancement (FIRMA).  USAID  has agreed to contribute US $14 million  and SIDA plans to contribute U.S. $7 million over the three-year plus two-year option life of project for a total ranging between US $20.5-  US $20.9 million (subject to congressional and parliamentary appropriations).
FIRMA will help SMEs in the three sectors capitalize on their relative comparative advantages and translate these into strong competitive advantages while addressing the identified challenges. The impact of improved competitiveness of firms in targeted sectors will be measured through increased sales, sustainable employment, and exports of firms in the targeted sectors. While the focus of assistance is to improve results of individual enterprises, the contractor is expected to design and implement assistance activities which will have a greater sector-wide impact including clusters, associations and other collaborative arrangements. 
The two bilateral donors of Sweden and the United States, have agreed to a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) for FIRMA. USAID will carry out procurement steps to competitively select an implementer, and will conduct contract administration on behalf of the two donors.  Both donors will be engaged in strategic management and oversight of FIRMA.  
This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 
Firms or organizations and subcontractors whose their source, origin and nationality is in countries party to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and the cooperating country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are eligible to compete. At this time, 39 countries, including European Union (EU) member states and the United States, are parties to the Agreement.
USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S and non- U.S. firms, small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor. 
Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) accessible on the FedBizOpps page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $7 million.
In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation is posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov). Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. 

Please do not contract USAID/BiH. All communication must be through this office. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

Quotations submitted in response to this solicitation must include: (1) Solicitation number HSCG85-09-Q-625718; (2) CLIN number, item name, part number, and unit/extended prices for all CLINs (3) proposed delivery after receipt of order in calendar days for each CLIN; (4) past performance information as required above (5) verification that each item shall be individually preserved, packaged, marked, bar-coded and shipped surface freight in accordance with best commercial practices; (6) taxpayer identification and Dun & Bradstreet (DUNS) number and Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number; (7) Contractors full name, address, and telephone number.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC> 
The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement for repair/refurbishment of the following: 1) NSN 2920-12-305-2407, ELECTRICAL ENGINE STARTER, BOSCH SICHERHEITSSYSTEME GMBH Part number: 680S638P01, Quantity 4 each in accordance with the following overhaul description:

PRELIMINARY INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:

Each Starter Motor shall be inspected as received to determine the extent of required repairs.  The contractor shall provide a cost estimate that includes all labor hours, material and parts to overhaul/repair the Starter Motor.  The serial number of the Starter Motor shall be included on the cost estimate.

Additionally, each Starter Motor shall be inspected and verified to have a thirteen (13) tooth bendix drive gear and a five (5) lug terminal configuration.  If the bendix drive gear or terminal lug configuration is not as stated, no further work shall be accomplished and the U.S. Coast Guard Contracting Officer shall be notified.

OVERHAUL REQUIREMENT:
The Starter Motor shall be overhauled/repaired to a condition which shall restore the operating and performance characteristics to the Robert Bosch GMBH Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) design specifications and standards.  The overhaul shall be performed in accordance with OEM specifications and standards to include upgrades as applicable.  

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Each Starter Motor shall have a tag attached to a connection terminal annotating the overhaul facility name and address.

Each Starter Motor shall have a tag attached to terminal 50 with instructions for the end user to ensure the jam nut is properly secured while tightening down the terminal cable hold-down nut. 

After completion of the overhaul/repair of the Starter Motor, the contractor shall perform standard production tests to assure maximum design performance to include but not limited to the following tests:

Each terminal on each Starter Motor shall be checked for its ground wall insulation resistance value to the Starter Motor case after final assembly using a 500 volt meggohmeter.

The final test reading shall not be less than 100 meggohms on a meter scale of R x 1000 minimum.  The megger shall have a current calibration which shall not have exceeded one year since the previous calibration.  Prior to conducting the test, both megger test leads shall be attached to the Starter Motor case and a reading of zero ohms shall be obtained, thus assuring an adequate ground connection to the Starter Motor case.  The ground lead shall remain connected and NOT be removed or relocated prior to any insulation resistance test.  If the ground lead is removed for ANY reason, the Starter Motor zero reading shall be verified using the procedure described above prior to the final test.

When insulation is exposed to a humid atmosphere, it absorbs moisture and the insulation resistance decreases.  Additionally, the amount of moisture absorption is increased by the amount of time the insulation is exposed to a humid atmosphere.  The resistance value also depends upon the type of insulation and its condition.  Since moisture may be driven off or evaporated by the application of heat, the insulation resistance of a winding having a low resistance reading, due to the presence of moisture, may be restored by energizing or externally heating the winding.  Therefore, the Starter Motor can be heated prior to the test.  Regardless of the test conditions, the Starter Motor shall not have a resistance value below 100 meggohms.  The contractor may, at his discretion, conduct the test in a controlled environment.  After any application of heat to the Starter Motor?s exterior, the Starter Motor shall be allowed to cool to ambient temperature, prior to the final pass fail insulation resistance test.  (Pass=greater than 100 meggohms). 
  
The contractor shall provide a Certificate of Conformance for each Starter Motor; one copy shall be placed in each box with the Starter Motor and one copy shall be forwarded to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.


WARRANTY:

__X_ A. Standard Manufacturers Warranty

____ B. Item being repaired as an onboard repair or system stock item and will be put into inventory.  NOT FOR IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION.  Contractor must guarantee item against defects that lead to failure for 90 days after installation for a period of up two (2) years after delivery to Coast Guard.

PRESERVATION:

Each Starter Motor shall be coated on the external surfaces with white paint to a dry film thickness of 3-5 mils. 

PRESERVATION / PACKAGING:

PACKAGING/PACKING:
Each Starter Motor shall be individually packed in a wooden box with internal bracing which shall be capable of providing adequate protection during storage and multiple shipments.  

The shaft of each Starter Motor shall be blocked and protected so that force applied in any direction during shipping and handling will not cause damage to the shaft.

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.
Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12.44<br /><br /><br />________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:<br /><br />HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month<br /><br />VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.&nbsp; Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.&nbsp; (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br /><br />HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.&nbsp; (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)&nbsp; (See 29 CFR 4174)<br /><br /><br /><br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<br />numbered):<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<br />employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<br />professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.&nbsp; Because most Computer<br />System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<br />$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<br />would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<br />rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<br />job families.&nbsp; In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<br />for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<br />that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<br />conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.&nbsp; For example, if an<br />individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<br />of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<br />this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<br />that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<br />described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.<br /><br />Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption.&nbsp; Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills.&nbsp; (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<br /><br />2)&nbsp; AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY:&nbsp; If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />&nbsp;If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).<br /><br /><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.&nbsp; This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder.&nbsp; All dry-house activities involving propellants or<br />explosives.&nbsp; Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<br />operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.&nbsp; All<br />operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br /><br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation,&nbsp; irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.&nbsp; These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br /><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br /><br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Technical Competence, Past Performance and Price </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Technical Competence and Past Performance, when combined, weighs more than price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors shall submit past performance information to include contract number, government agency point of contact and contact information, description of supplies/services<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>provided, unit of issue, unit price, and extended price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Past performance shall be current and shall not exceed three (3) fiscal years before posting date of the combined synopsis/solicitation on FBO.</span></p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The government is seeking information from industry in regard to the A-10 OCONUS Depot recompete on the following issues:</strong>
<p>1. The government is trying to determine whether it is advantageous to request a graduated price scale for the number of aircraft inductions (i.e. quantity discount). We request that potential bidders respond to the following scenario: The government projects a range of 3-6 aircraft inductions per year during the contract period. If six aircraft were inducted in a given year, is there any potential savings to the government on six aircraft under graduated pricing versus the cost of those six aircraft if the negotiated cost was independent of the number inducted? <br /><br />Do potential bidders see any significant cost breaks in inducting 1-6 aircraft? Are there sufficient economies of scale to request bidders to provide a graduated schedule for aircraft inductions? If so, how close in time would these inductions have to be made in order to realize these economies of scale?</p>
<p>2. The Government has established a requirement to limit the contract depot facility to a maximum distance of 400 nautical miles from Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany. For market research purposes and possible consideration, the government would like to ascertain the number of interested qualified bidders outside of this range who are unable to bid due to this requirement. We request that all qualified and interested sources within the European theater but greater than 400 NM from Spangdahlem AB, please provide your company name and proposed facility location to the government contracting representative.</p>
<p>3. The government is currently considering a requirements type contract as defined by FAR 16.503 as a contract that "provides for filling all actual purchase requirements of designated Government activities for supplies or services during a specified contract period, with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by placing orders with the contractor".</p>
<p>An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract is defined by FAR 16.504 as a contract that "provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period.

<DESC><p><strong>The government is seeking information from industry in regard to the A-10 OCONUS Depot recompete on the following issues:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. The government is trying to determine whether it is advantageous to request a graduated price scale for the number of aircraft inductions (i.e. quantity discount). We request that potential bidders respond to the following scenario: The government projects a range of 3-6 aircraft inductions per year during the contract period. If six aircraft were inducted in a given year, is there any potential savings to the government on six aircraft under graduated pricing versus the cost of those six aircraft if the negotiated cost was independent of the number inducted?</p>
<p>Do potential bidders see any significant cost breaks in inducting 1-6 aircraft? Are there sufficient economies of scale to request bidders to provide a graduated schedule for aircraft inductions? If so, how close in time would these inductions have to be made in order to realize these economies of scale?</p>
<p>2. The Government has established a requirement to limit the contract depot facility to a maximum distance of 400 nautical miles from Osan Air Force Base, South Korea. For market research purposes and possible consideration, the government would like to ascertain the number of interested qualified bidders outside of this range who are unable to bid due to this requirement. We request that all qualified and interested sources within the Pacific theater but greater than 400 NM from Osan AB, please provide your company name and proposed facility location to the government contracting representative.</p>
<p>3. The government is currently considering a requirements type contract as defined by FAR 16.503 as a contract that "provides for filling all actual purchase requirements of designated Government activities for supplies or services during a specified contract period, with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by placing orders with the contractor".</p>
<p>An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract is defined by FAR 16.504 as a contract that "provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual requirements. ... The contract must require the Government to order and the contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services"? (The applicable regulations can be accessed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm)<br />Under a requirements type contract there is no contractually binding minimum quantity, however all services ordered under the scope of the contract for the duration of the contract will be guaranteed to the contract holder. Under an ID/IQ type contract the government is contractually bound to order a minimum quantity of services, but is not bound to order any further services once the minimum quantity is met. <br />Which of these contractual arrangements would be preferable to potential bidders?</p>

If an impaired objectivity or bias OCI exists, based upon the offerors' LTRS SE&amp;I submitted OCI Mitigation Plan, the cost of performing needed additional Government review, oversight, and administration will be considered when evaluating proposals during source selection.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) intends to issue a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOI) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) modules and pilot production. This LOI is in support of U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Solar America Initiative (SAI). Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. This Solicitation is targeted at innovative R&D on PV cell and module prototypes with demonstrated functionality in either large-area cell/module form or, preferably, prototypes produced in pilot-scale operations. The emphasis on proposed activities should be on the barriers to manufacturing scale-up and 2012 commercialization. The primary objective of this program is to shorten the timeline for companies to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacture. Responders to this Solicitation are expected to focus their efforts on a limited number of high impact areas that lie on the critical path to scaling-up their technology to full manufacture. The minimum entrance criterion is demonstrated laboratory PV process technology (feedstock, wafers, cells or modules). The successful exit criterion is for prototype modules and pilot production demonstration >2MW/year. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that 6 to 10 subcontracts, up to $3M each, will be awarded as 18-month phased subcontracts. A Net Conference regarding the project is scheduled for Friday, March 6, 2009, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time. The Solicitation will be available to view/download on February 17, 2009 from NREL's website at: http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html.

<DESC>This is a reissue of sources sought N0002409R2216 with an emphasis on delivery schedules in anticipation of a potential future procurement program with the Government of Iraq.  In support of the eventual turnover of security responsibilities to the Iraqi Government, expedited deliveries of these vessels is of paramount importance.  Due to the vital need of this request, the Government is seeking responses from sources that can provide an accelerated delivery schedule even if the existing boat or boat design does not fully meet the characteristics listed below.  As a part of the response to this RFI, interested sources should indicate which characteristics can and cannot be met.  Interested sources are encouraged to propose delivery schedules that can realistically be achieved while keeping in mind the vital need of this request.
The Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine the existence of a Coastal Patrol Boat possessing the characteristics listed below (same characteristics as the original N0002409R2216).  We will also consider existing boats or proven designs that come close to possessing these characteristics if this will help to accelerate the delivery schedules.  The boats would be procured under a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case and would operate in the Arabian Gulf off the coast of Iraq:
a.	Hull length at least 30 meters and up to 35 metersb.	Speed requirement of 30 knots at full load displacement under tropical conditions (air temperature 450 C and sea water temperature 370 C) in calm waterc.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to extend the response deadline for this RFI by one day.  All information must be submitted to garrettj@sec.gov by no later than 1:00 p.m. EST on Februay 18th, 2009.


Request for Information (RFI)
Prospective Move of Current Alternate Data Center (ADC) to a New Facility

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a high-availability data delivery model for its information systems that provides simultaneous access to distributed information content. To this end, the SEC requires a secure high availability Alternate Data Center (ADC) facility located within the greater Washington DC metropolitan area. The contract for its current facility expires in March 2010. The SEC needs to evaluate the options of retaining the existing ADC in Ashburn, VA or relocating it to another data center yet to be identified. If the SEC decides to move the ADC, the contractor will need to move the SECs computing equipment, which the SEC operates remotely, into the new collocated hosting facility with a minimum amount of down time due to the move. It is of primary importance that the operations of EDGAR, an electronic filing system used by the SEC to manage publicly traded corporations, remain unaffected by the move. The technical solution at the new collocated hosting facility shall preserve the infrastructure architecture including the data replication architecture of the current ADC.
The SEC seeks information about a turnkey solution to 1) assess the SECs current Alternate Data Center (ADC) and develop a preliminary move plan to facilitate a successful migration of the ADC from the current facility to a new collocated hosting facility that provides telecommunication services from vendors on the GSA Networx and WITS 3 contracts; 2) provide the new collocated hosting facility; and 3) plan and implement the move of the SEC ADC from its current location to the new collocated hosting facility. 

NOTE:  This announcement is a Request for Information, not a solicitation.  The SEC is issuing this RFI to gather information on the capabilities of industry and price estimates for the work outlined in the attached Draft Requirements document.  If you are interested in providing information, please review the attachments and send all info. to Jeremy Garrett.  You may include price range estimates.  The SEC will consider all responses to this RFI as information only, not offers.  All information must be sent via email to GarrettJ@sec.gov by no later than the response deadline.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Naval Air Warfare and Weapons Department (ONR 35) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for conduct of basic research in technology areas relevant to rotorcraft. As basic research, proposed projects should develop new scientific knowledge, improve theoretical understanding, and provide a basis for advances in rotorcraft technology. Research topics should focus on basic scientific issues inspired by rotorcraft technology needs and having the potential for making significant contributions towards Navy research thrusts and DoD goals and missions. Technology transfer and the partnering of this research with the US rotorcraft industry, U.S. Navy, other Government organizations (e.g., U.S. Army, NASA, FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.

The proposed research should emphasize innovative, creative basic research rather than application of existing technologies. Projects should not be directed at specific aircraft or systems, and need not offer immediate or specifically identifiable improvements in rotorcraft technology. Projects that merely apply engineering methods to develop or evaluate unusual vehicle configurations or components are not of interest under this Announcement. Although software development per se is not a goal of this announcement, projects demonstrating new methods via their software implementation will be considered.

The purpose of this Modification/Amendment is to attach Amendment 0005.

<DESC>Question 1.  Will the materials developed under this contract become the property of the Government?<BR><BR>Answer: All developed materials will become the property of the Government. Use of the developed items for other entities or private sectors concerns will be prohibited. Use of these items for governmental entities will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the Contracting Officer, the course manager, and the program manager. <BR><BR>Question 2. Please describe the desired treatment of the copyrighted Good to Great material and its leadership principles in the course<BR><BR>Answer:  The Government has already purchased the rights to use this copyrighted material. The treatment of the Good to Great materials will be determined at the two-day post-award meeting. Suggestions and other input from the selected contractor will be welcomed at that time. Unless changed to a telephonic session, this meeting will be held at the Governments facility in Huntsville, AL, however the dates of the meeting are not yet defined. In accordance with the paragraph 3.6 of the Performance Work Statement, the selected contractor will have 5 business days to arrange the post-award meeting.<BR><BR>Question 3. To what degree does the Government expect the materials and content from the Gallup Day to be integrated into the other two and a half days of the course? <BR><BR>Answer: The Governments intent is that the content from the Gallup Development Day be integrated with the rest of the seminar to a significant degree. The selected contractor will be involved to the extent of ensuring that their materials will not be in conflict with the Gallup presentation. This topic will also be addressed at the post-award meeting referenced in item 2.<BR><BR>Question 4. To what degree will the selected contractor be able to assign pre-work and post-work to support achieving the learning objectives of the course?<BR><BR>Answer: The selected contractor will not be able to assign pre-work or post-work to attendees. <BR><BR>Question 5. Is the intent is for one or more Corps of Engineers employees to serve as prospective  instructors and observe the delivery of the course, at some point will those individuals either co-facilitate this course with a contractor personnel or deliver the course alone without support of contractor personnel? If yes, please describe the Governments plan for training these prospective employees to guarantee ability to deliver the course successfully to meet the quality expectations of the Government.<BR><BR>Answer:  The Government does not intend to have Corps of Engineers employees to co-facilitate the seminar or to deliver the course without the support of contractor personnel, during first year of this contract. Should the option year be exercised, the possibility of co-facilitation is held open. <BR><BR>Question 6. It appears that this course is currently being offered. Does that mean that it is already developed and the ULC is completely overhauling it or is just looking for some tweaking? <BR><BR>Answer: This course is currently not being offered. The Governments intent is to receive a revised course based on the course objectives and Government furnished materials. <BR><BR>Question 7 . Travel and expenses  how these will be handled for the contractor? <BR><BR>Answer: The Government does not anticipate any other expenses besides course development, course instruction, travel and per diem. All allowable, reasonable, and substantiated travel expenses will be reimbursed at actual cost in accordance with FAR 31.205-46.<BR><BR>Question 8. What if any expectations for follow up/refresher modules are there?  <BR><BR><BR>Answer:  The Government does not anticipate any electronic follow-up/refresher modules thus these items are not required to be developed as part of the initial course. In the distant future, if it is determined by the Government that such items are needed, the Government may consider modifying the awarded contract to include development of such items. <BR><BR><BR>*Other clarifications*<BR><BR><BR>"	The first hour of the first day is devoted to getting the students registered in good order. The 28 hours for this course is composed of the following: Nineteen hours of instruction by contractor + 8 hours by Gallup + 1 for registration. Both instructors for a session shall be present during the full 28 hours of the seminar.  <BR><BR><BR>"	Costs for developing and instructing this course will not be kept separate. A firm fixed price will be paid for course development, course instruction, and (if need be) revising the course based on the Governments needs. In addition, the extent of these revisions will likely be limited to no more than twice during the period of the contract <BR><BR>"	The government will not require train-the-trainer services from the contractor. <BR><BR>"	This seminar is scheduled for FY2009, but no sessions have been conducted before. The ULC has offered and conducted leadership seminars in the past, and this new one retains some similarities with those. Essentially this undertaking should be regarded as developing a new seminar or, at the least, 'completely overhauling' a previous one.<BR><BR>

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561210 with a small business size standard of $32,500,000. The resulting contracts will be for a base period of one year with four one year options.

Any award to be made from the upcoming solicitation will be based on the best overall (i.e. best value) proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the three (3) evaluation factors: Technical, Past Performance, and Cost. Technical is more important than Past Performance. The Technical factor is comprised of two (2) sub-factors: Soundness of Approach and Management. Soundness of Approach is more important than Management. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Cost. Offerors will be evaluated independently for the Philpott Lake Project and independently for the W. Kerr Scott Project. Pursuant to FAR 16.301-3, no award will be made to an offeror that does not have an adequate cost accounting system for determining costs applicable to the contract. All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number and register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors must also register on the ORCA website for online representations and certifications. The offer due date will be stated in the solicitation. The entire solicitation will be made available only on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizops.gov . Paper copies will not be available.

<DESC><p>JTC TRS is a mission simulation system that has joint applicability for training personnel in all services. JTC TRS is a high fidelity simulator designed to conduct stand-alone and networked terminal control training and mission rehearsal. It will enable small teams, or individuals to train in a stand-alone or networked mode with other Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) participants through a full range of composite force employment options. The JTC TRS will support multiple, simultaneous modes of operation including: individual operator execution of a terminal control mission and multiple scenarios, small team operations (Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Special Tactics Team (STT), Special Forces Operational Detachments Alpha (SF ODAs), SEAL Teams, Army Rangers, etc), and long haul, networked DMO missions. It will be capable of processing and displaying an accurate air/ground scene representation of virtual, constructive, and live forces generated locally or in the DMO environment.</p>

<AWARDEE>AT&T Corporation, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182 US
<DESC>The General Services Administration has awarded a sole source long distance bridge contract to AT&T Corporation to replace its current Federal Telecommunications System 2001 (FTS2001) Long Distance Crossover Contract (GS00T01AHD0002). The period of performance is 16 months and is effective March 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. The estimated dollar value is $166M.  The contract is necessary to allow sufficient time to implement transition to a contract under the Networx Program and phase out the existing contract.  (Note: This requirement was originally published under Solicitation Number QTA-TH-08-1003 but was changed due to a revised agency PIIN format.)
