The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to CV Miami LLC, Miami Free Zone.  The extension will be for 10,006 usable/rentable square feet of warehouse space for a term of four months.

The Government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government?s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within ten (10) days of publication of this notice.

Responses are due by close of business December 21, 2007.

NSWC is currently upgrading existing boats in the fleet and outfitting new SDV boats.  This purchase is notsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The SDV was originally outfitted with cables and cable assemblies produced by SeaCon Brantner.  Requested material will be used with existing hardware and has already been through operational and technical evaluation for certification. Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without approval from project engineers.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly to the government and to the mission.  Any variance in the parts used on certified systems would jeopardize the certification of the sys!  tems and ultimately the mission.  NAICS  334417

<DESC>NAVAIR NAWCAD Lakehurst intends to enter into a sole source procurement with the Bell-Boeing JPO (BBJPO) for the procurement of the testingm, manufacture, and site-stand up of V-22 Operational Test Program Sets in support of the CV-22 Program.  This procurement is composed of a total of two production sets of Lots 1 and 2 OTPS to be used on the RTCASS Automatic Test Equipment. The Navy does not own specifications, drawings, and related data to permit full and open competition.   BBJPO, the designer, developer, and integrator of the V-22 Aircraft Weapons System, is the original manufacturer of these OTPSs on the V-22 aircraft and remains the only business entity that has all the required proprietary rights and non disclosure agreements with the suppliers of the aircraft components that are necessary to manufacture this PSE.  These items are still in varying design, devolopment and integration phases under various other contracts and therefore the government does not posses the data to permit full and open competition. The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, Clinical Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Computer Sciences Corporation, Federal Sector ? Civil Group, 7700 Hubble Drive, Lanham-Seabrook, Maryland  20706, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253( c ) (1 )?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Clinical Center has utilized the services of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) during the initial development and installation of the Clinical Center Clinical Research Information System (CRIS).  During this time, CSC developed an understanding of the daily operations of the NIH Clinical Center as well as a full knowledge of the key information technology issues facing the clinical research hospital and the NIH intramural program.  Specifically, CSC has a full knowledge of the scope and breadth of clinical research data, the data models, the critical technical and data architectures of the current CRIS system and how these would relate to the CRIS II project, as well as the enterprise project requirements involving human research data including OMB requirements, privacy and HIPAA concerns and competing resource requirements between NIH enterprise systems.  CSC has provided integration services for the NIH intramural program since 2001 and during this time helped to establish critical requirements for the clinical research data repository. 

Because of CSC?s knowledge of CRIS as well as the organization and governance of NIH enterprise systems, as well as their expertise in building warehousing systems (both technically and from an organizational perspective) CSC will provide unique capabilities that will enable the NIH intramural program to start the CRIS II project quickly and ensure a plan and approach for long term success.  Utilizing the services of another service provider will jeopardize this project based on the time necessary for knowledge acquisition, establishing a new staff infrastructure and the need to tap already exhausted NIH CC resources for orientation and support.  

Interested parties that believe they have the performance capability required should send supporting information that documents that belief.  The Government would like to review descriptive literature and pricing as part of this market research to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement.  The information provided need not be excessive in length, but should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that your company understands the nature of work involved, and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform.  

The NAIC and small business size thresholds for this requirement are respectively, 541519 and $23.0M.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within forty-five calendar days from the date of the publication of this synopsys will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. This procurement shall be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. 
Responses are requested by January 27, 2008.  Please address responses to Julius Y. Tidwell, Contracting Officer, National Institutes of Health, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 106M, Mail Stop Code 5480, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-5480 or via e-mail to jtidwell@cc.nih.gov.

The intended period of performance for this requirement will be January 1, 2008 - December 31, 2010.

Argon and associated products used in the EPA-NEIC laboratory are ordered on an as needed basis.  The NEIC laboratory must be able to obtain argon in short periods of time to meet the ever changing types of analyses that take place at the  NEIC laboratory; it is crucial to have immediate access to instrumental gases due to short holding times on criminal project samples to be analyzed.  Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within  fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered for award.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Cara Lynch at lynch.cara@epa.gov. by COB on December 27th, 2007.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  

SafeNet Maintenance for continued use in support of the Department?s PKI Program.

4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet products to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.

5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).  SafeNet is the developer, owner of the software and sole distributor.

Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors.

A price analysis will be conducted to ensure that the cost is fair and reasonable.

 
8.	A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.

Safenet is manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source.

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  N/A


10.	A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. N/A

PKI/BLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet.  Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution.  Should a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these products will be considered as potential sources.

On NSN 2610-01-356-9098 Michelin NA and Goodyear are approved to make the tire. On NSN 2610-01-559-2516 Michelin NA is only approved to provide the tire. The scope of this contract is for all Tire NSNs managed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) related to Armor/Tactical Vehicles, vehicles, and equipment end-items application. This NSN follows under that scope. There will be no separate solicitation issued for this action. Specifications, plans, or drawings are available. However, this acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). NSN: 2610-01-559-2516; Item Description: TIRE, PNEUMATIC,VEHI; Manufacturer?s Code and Part Number: (12195) P/N: 44852; Annual Demand Qty: 10836; 5 Year Base with 5 Year Option; Unit of Issue: Each   See Applicable Numbered Notes: 12

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Melvin Fondue, Purchasing Agent, Phone (206) 526-6043, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service,(NMFS) located in Sacramento, CA requires a contractor to provide Recovery Planning Process for the Evolutionarily Significant Units of Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and 
Central Valley Spring-run Chinook Salmon, and the Distinct Population Segment of Central Valley Steelhead (O. mykiss). Assist (NMFS) with the recovery planning process for the Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and the Central Valley steelhead distinct population segment (DPS).  This proposed assistance is intended to occur in a phased approached.  The first two phases, which were recently completed, involved development of an early draft recovery plan including a threats assessment report, and preparation of a second more complete administrative draft plan intended for internal NMFS and co-manager review.  These early drafts of the recovery plan are consistent with NMFS? definition of such a document in that it is a work in progress to show development for those areas not yet covered by a proposed or interim regional recovery plan.  The next proposed phase involves advancing the administrative/co-manager draft stage to a public comment draft stage. 

Task 1: Complete Sections within the Administrative Draft Recovery Plan 
A few sections within the administrative draft recovery plan require additional detail. The next proposed phase in the recovery planning process involves finishing these incomplete sections. Also, Appendix B (Recovery Actions) shall be expanded and reformatted as necessary to function as the Implementation Plan section of the draft recovery plan.  If the estimated cost is an over-estimate, any remaining funds could be allocated to subsequent recovery planning phases and tasks.  Conversely, if PRD and co-manager review produces substantial comments requiring significant revisions for the threats information or the Implementation Plan section, contractor will notify NMFS immediately to determine how much work can be completed by the deliverable date. 

Deliverable:  Provide additional language to the draft recovery plan where gaps or lack of detail currently exist, and will include addressing gaps in information in the threats to the three species/runs. This will include expanding Appendix B, with NMFS assistance, into a full implementation plan section.


Task 2:  Respond to and/or Incorporate Suggested Revisions and Comments Generated from the Co-Manager?s Review of the Admin Draft Recovery Plan. 
In addition to addressing the incomplete sections within the early draft recovery plan, a second major task is required to advance the plan to the public comment draft stage.  The admin draft recovery plan is currently undergoing review within the Protected Resources Division (PRD) and State, Federal, and local co-managers.  To reach the public draft stage, any suggested revisions and comments generated from this review must be responded to and/or incorporated into the plan.  The scope of this task is dependent upon the number and complexity of suggested revisions and comments. Conversely, if PRD and co-manager review produces substantial comments requiring significant revisions, contractor will notify NMFS immediately to determine how much work can be completed by the deliverable date.
Deliverables: 	contractor will provide a third draft recovery plan and progress update, which will incorporate NMFS and co-manager edits and revisions.  
		
All responsible sources may submit a bid for consideration. A Request for Quotations will be issued on/about December 26, 2007 This is s simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

MANDATORY CLAUSE: The Western Region Acquisition Division required all contractors doing business with this acquisition to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of Aircraft Recapitalization Plan.
<SOLNBR>WASC-8-29937
<RESPDATE>122607
<ARCHDATE>01102008
<CONTACT>Melvin Fondue, Purchasing Agent, Phone (206) 526-6043, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
NOAA?s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) requires the services of a contractor to integrate the efforts of an existing government personnel and contractor team in the development of a Fleet Recapitalization Plan.  

NOAA was asked in the FY2005 Appropriations Conference Report 108-792 to develop ship and aircraft modernization plans to guide future acquisition activity.  NOAA directed OMAO to take the lead on these efforts.  This document outlines OMAO?s approach for completing the aircraft portion of this request.  Development of the aircraft modernization plan will use an approach very similar to ship plan that was successfully completed and submitted in October 2007. 

The purpose of this solicitation is to acquire the services of a contractor to help with the development of the comprehensive plan discussed below.  The approach for doing so will be to follow the same format and requirements-based approach as the ship plan (October 2007).    

Background

NOAA has previously assessed its airborne data collection requirements and determined its need to modernize its fleet.  Previous efforts included: 

?	A 2000 Mitertek internal assessment of NOAA light aircraft operations.
?	An internal 2001 conference report on how NOAA heavy aircraft will adapt to Programmatic and Technological Changes over a 5-10 year period 
?	Report of NOAA?s Airborne Platform Requirements for the Ten-Year Period from FY2003 ? FY2012
?	An aircraft modernization plan in 2006 that was sent to Department of Commerce (DoC) but was not approved

The 2006 aircraft modernization plan was prepared in response to the FY2005 Appropriations Conference Report 108-792.  It only discussed aircraft already included in NOAA?s FY07-11 budget request.  The current effort is intended to address comments received from DOC on the 2006 report and the draft interim report and produce a comprehensive recapitalization plan that is suitable for short and long-term (15 year) planning purposes.  

Approach

Develop a comprehensive recapitalization plan which responds to Department of Commerce and Congressional requests to:
?	Document airborne collection requirements and link these requirements to performance metrics and programmatic requirements 
?	Provide a cost-effectiveness analysis of Government-owned and constructed versus private sector chartered aircraft.  Private and academic sector assets will be considered in this analysis.
?	Provide service life estimates for current NOAA aircraft assets
?	Evaluate the  use of new and alternative technologies (e.g. UASs, phased array radar) for meeting at airborne collection requirements

Staffing and Support

Staffing to support this effort will be provided by OMAO personnel, with line office and program support matrixed to the team on an as-needed basis.  A key contractor position for the effort is required to lead and integrate the efforts of the team to develop the products listed below under Deliverables and Milestones.  OMAO will provide office space and a computer for this key person.

This order is for the key contractor who will lead and integrate the efforts of the team, and will also be responsible for delivery of products.  

This is s simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

MANDATORY CLAUSE: The Western Region Acquisition Division required all contractors doing business with this acquisition to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE. The 651 ELSS Hanscom AFB Weather office intends to issue a sole source purchase order under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) and FAR 6.301-1(b)(1)(i) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to Mesotech International, Inc. for the procurement of the following:  A) Airfield Weather Advisor Version 7.0 Upgrade Kit; and B) Windows Server 2003 System Security Authorization Agreement Documentation.  NOTE:  The work consists of submittal of one complete document showing updates indicated above to the FMQ-19 Program Office at the 651 Electronic System Squadron, Hanscom AFB MA.  See Statement of Work listed below.  No request for quote will be transmitted via Federal Business Opportunities. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Please contact the Page Manager if you have any questions or concerns. Statement of Work 1.0  Airfield Weather Advisor Version 7.0 Upgrade Kit The Airfield Weather Advisor (AWA) V7 upgrade kit contains three parts. Part 1 is a 50 foot serial cable used for FMQ-19 to N-TFS communication. Part 2 is a two software kits. The first kit is the Security Update kit. This kit contains Windows Server 2000 operating system patches. The second software kit is the AWA V7 upgrade. Part 3 is three sets of instructions. The first set of instructions details step by step in instructions on how to apply the Security Update kit. This instruction contains a set of manual windows registry edit changes in addition to system software patch sets. The second set of instructions details step by step on how to install and configure the AWA V7 upgrade. The third instruction provides information on how to install the serial cable and how to configure AWA V7 for FMQ-19 to N-TFS communications.  The AWA V7 upgrade kit needs to be purchased. Because of the complexity of the software installation, owing to the fact that much of the operating system update is by way of manual settings, it is appropriate for anyone performing the software installations to have adequate training. The work case scenario is as follows: 1.Backup to AWA 6 database. Save backup to floppy or burn CD 2.Install the Windows Server 2000 operating update 3.Install the AWA V7 upgrade 4.Verify the AWA V7 upgrade by checking all airfield components 5.If N-TFS is present, install the FMQ-19 to N-TFS cable 6.Configure the AWA for N-TFS 7.Verify FMQ-19 to N-TFS operability Generally, the entire installation requires five hours. 2.0 Windows Server 2003 System Security Authorization Agreement Documentation  Updating the current security package is required to support FMQ-19 Windows Server 2003 Certification and Accreditation (C&A).  The update to these documents should include updates to the core System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA) document and associated appendices.  This update will address any changes to the Operating System, applications and overall system functionality.  This will include update to tables and diagrams as necessary (hardware, software, network diagrams, etc.).  In addition, ESC will require submission of documentation to answer and validate the relative Information Assurance (IA) controls of the system to satisfy the requirements the DoD IA C&A Process (DIACAP).

The final solicitation is now anticipated to be issued without further notice on or about January 2008 and will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website (https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/). Update 13 September 2007 The synopsis is revised to correct the contract number of the second listed incumbent contractor from N0039-03-D-0006 to N00039-03-D-0006.

The Government will conduct final integration, software load and shipping.

Individual delivery/task orders will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis for NAVSSI systems, upgrade/retrofit kits, and spares and on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis for services.  The basic contracts will establish minimum and maximum ordering quantities.  The prospective contracts will have a (5) year ordering period. This is a full and open competition. The final solicitation will be issued without further notice on or about October 2007 and will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website (https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/).  A Bidders Mailing List will not be established, and hard copies of documents will not be provided. Contract award is estimated for March 2008. The contractor will be required to demonstrate efforts to provide subcontracting opportunities for Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone) and other SB concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 517410 (Satellite Telecommunications).

<SUBJECT>A--Development of Fully Integrated Mercury Model (MERGANSER) for New England States.
<SOLNBR>PR-NC-08-10027
<RESPDATE>122207
<ARCHDATE>01212008
<CONTACT>JOHN M. SOUTHERLAND, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3416, E-Mail: southerland.john@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for the Development of Fully Integrated Mercury Model for New England States.  EPA believes that the Northeast States for coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) is the only source qualified to perform this effort.  This requirement is to complete work to develop a regression-based mercury model for New England in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment.  The (Mercury Geo-spatial Assessments for the New England Region - MERGANSER) model will integrate recent atmospheric mercury-deposition models with many databases on mercury sources, mercury levels in fish and bird tissue, and ecosystem features that may be associated with risk of mercury contamination on biota and, ultimately, humans.  Under this contract, the contractor will ensure that the mercury emissions inventory for the New England states is accurate, model wet and dry air deposition of mercury, identify the most appropriate air-deposition models to use for MERGANSER, provide inputs to the High Resolution Deposition Model, and complete the biota and watershed components of the model as well as integration of other model elements.  NESCAUM is a regional organization that represents the interests of co-regulators and co-implementors in the execution of national/regional environmental programs related to air pollution control planning and air resources management under the Clean Air Act for eight northeast states, six of which are New England states; i.e., Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  For the past five years, NESCAUM has been involved in laying the groundwork for the development of MERGANSER for the New England states.   Specifically, they have refined mercury emissions inventory for input to atmospheric-deposition modeling, used emission inventory data for the northeast region to develop inputs for REMSAD air-deposition model, and estimated total mercury deposition for New England.   As a result, NESCAUM is considered uniquely qualified to complete the MERGANSER project, and have all of the data, knowledge, and scientific expertise to complete this effort in a timely and efficient manner.  It is not believed that any other contractor has the required knowledge and expertise and would, in fact, take several years to obtain the required level of knowledge and expertise at which point the data would be out of date.  In addition, NESCAUM has established relationships with each of the environmental organizations within the six New England states to ensure that the requirements of each state are adequately addressed and the resources within each state are effectively utilized.  This is critical to the success of this effort.  If any firm believes that they have the required knowledge and expertise to accomplish this effort, they should submit a response to the above address within fifteen (15) days of this notice.  The response should include specific information on the firms expertise and knowledge of the proposed effort by addressing the following criteria:  1) Demonstrated knowledge of mercury air emission source inventories in the Northeast from 1998 to present; 2) Ability to provide estimates of mercury wet and dry deposition based upon the mercury emission inventories; 3) Ability to provide seasonal and annual estimates of wet and dry deposition for a 100 meter grid for the six New England States to be incorporated into the High Resolution Deposition Model (HDRM); 4) Ability to build a multi-variate model taking into consideration environmental variables that are linked to predict mercury levels in fish tissue, using a yellow perch equivalent, for lakes throughout New England; and 5) Ability to develop an empirical linkage between mercury levels in fish and in fish-eating birds.   Offerors considered qualified to perform this effort should also have experience in coordinating and working with the six New England states to represent their interests as co-regulators and co-implementors in the execution of regional environmental air pollution programs.  All responses received will be evaluated against the above provided criteria. NAICS Code 541620 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned specific information and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711

<DESC>This is a modification/attachment to previously posted FedBizOps, Solicitation <BR>W900KK-08-AMBUSH<BR><BR>DARWARS Ambush!<BR>CREW-2 Development and Distribution<BR>STATEMENT OF WORK<BR>19 October 2007<BR><BR>Background<BR>In early 2004 DARPA, under the DARWARS program, began an effort to develop an innovative training application, initially focused on convoy operations in support of US forces deploying to the Iraq theater.  Beginning in September 2004, DARWARS Ambush! developed, deployed and supporte d a number of hardware/software systems as well as software only systems.  Since the last major Ambush! release [Version 1.2] in February, 2005 over 100 copies of Ambush! have been distributed to the US military who have been installing the Ambush! trainer  at numerous sites and incorporating the system into their training as they prepare for deployment.  At the MSTF in Ft Lewis, for example, thousands of troops have already been trained on a 60 plus station system with a throughput rate of as much as 400 tr oops per week.  In addition, a number of new applications addressing other training topics including Rules of Engagement training have been developed and distributed.  This effort will address the modifications and upgrades necessary to develop the capabil ity within the Ambush! Training System to help ascertain appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) when using the CREW-2 IED jammer system and to train users in those TTPs.<BR><BR>Scope<BR>The scope of this effort addresses the tasks needed to develop, test, integrate, and deliver DARWARS Ambush! modifications which will represent radio-controlled IEDs, hard wired IEDs and the CREW-2 IED countermeasure system in order to support the development and training CREW-2 TTPs.  The scope shall inclu de all activities to ensure the successful completion of the requirements as identified in Sections 3.0 (Base) and 4.0 (Option). <BR><BR>Tasks/Technical Requirements (Base)<BR><BR>The contractor shall develop an Ambush! model of the CREW-2 IED jammer which  simulates the propagation of CREW-2 as a function of line-of-sight between transmitter and IED. The IEDs will have an associated detection volume used by the line-of-sight computation to control their sensitivity.<BR> <BR>The contractor shall develop s imulated radio controlled IEDs in Ambush! that are inhibited from detonation when jammed by the CREW-2. The range of the CREW-2 must be configurable by an operator or instructor. An operator or instructor must be able to insert a fault which disables the C REW-2 for non RCIEDs.<BR><BR>*Note: Not all RCIEDs are jammed by the CREW-2 IED jammer.<BR><BR>The contractor shall develop Electronic Warfare notifications in the mission notebook to inform Soldiers of the status of the CREW-2 jammer. Make the  ability to restrict voice communications capabilities within Ambush! in order to  conditionally filter a transmission so as to model the effects of CREW-2 broadcasts on radio communication when EW procedures are not followed or updated. The default will be to bloc k it entirely, or substitute a recording of radio static.  This modification will affect communications for all vehicles within range of a transmitter.  <BR><BR>The contractor shall add a variant of the current HMMWV, Stryker, Suburban, 10 Ton Fueler, 10 T on Cargo, M113, M1A1, and 5 Ton Cargo models in Ambush! that includes: <BR>A CREW-2 antenna<BR>A CREW-2 Remote Control Unit (RCU) showing CREW-2s switches (power on/off, run/standby, zeroize) and LED Panel lights (green, amber, red).<BR>An action drop dow n menu for controlling the CREW-2 via the RCU. <BR>An action drop down menu for troubleshooting the CREW-2 LED lights.<BR>An action drop down menu for disabling the CREW-2 system when compromised (with or without power to CREW-2 unit)<BR>Note: A convoy can  include any number of  CREW-2 equipped vehicles.<BR><BR>The contractor shall modify Ambush! AAR plan view display to draw a dynamically updating (unclassified)  range ring depicting CREW-2 coverage. The range ring will show the effects of obstructions (e.g., buildings) on the otherwise circular pattern. <BR><BR>The contractor shall develop visual models for five (5) new radio controlled IEDs and two (2) new hard  wired IEDs (pressure plate, command wired) in consultation with the customer. <BR><BR>The contractor shall adapt three existing Ambush! scenarios to exhibit the new CREW-2 functionality. These scenarios can be further modified  and new scenarios created )  by instructors using the existing built-in mission authoring tools.<BR><BR>The contractor shall update the existing Ambush! documentation to include the new models, actions, scripts and scenarios.<BR><BR>The contractor shall perform all necessary testi ng to verify the performance of the new models and scripts, shall maintain all changes and documentation in a configuration management system, and shall make the CREW-2 modification available to all existing users.<BR><BR>The contractor shall attend up to two technical interchange meetings with the government and government technical representatives to obtain information on the CREW-2, its capabilities and functions, on any existing TTPs and on IEDs.<BR><BR>The contractor shall establish and maintain a mana gement, cost, and review program to ensure proper performance of program requirements.  The contractor shall conduct administrative and financial management functions during the course of this effort such as: scheduling of activities and milestones; descri bing status; outlining contractor activity and progress toward accomplishment of objectives; planning, forecasting and making recommendations on funding and funding changes; program planning; and describing in detail the overall conduct and results of the effort.<BR><BR>The Ambush! documents will be updated and delivered in contractor format. Status reports including technical status, financial reporting, schedule and risk will be delivered on an as required basis.    <BR><BR>The contractor shall complete t his base effort three months ARO.<BR><BR>Tasks/Technical Requirements (Option)<BR><BR>The contractor shall develop an Ambush! model of the CREW-Man pack Chameleon IED jammer  and simulates the propagation of CREW as a function of line-of-sight between tr ansmitter and IED. <BR><BR>The contractor shall participate in technical discussions with the Government to determine appropriate levels of fidelity for CREW-2 operational effectiveness and communications interference which could be modeled in Ambush! and which are consistent with the overall training objectives for Ambush!<BR><BR>The contractor shall update the CREW-2, IED and communications interference models to capture agreed-upon higher fidelity capabilities.

<DESC>Change:  The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is deleted from this requirement and will be procured under a separate procurement.<BR><BR>All references to SATOC (Single Award Task Order Contract) are deleted and replaced with MATOC (Multiple A ward Task Order Contract).  The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity an d re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial tasks as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experienc e for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented uns atisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance.  The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.  Other solicitations for  similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.<BR><BR>Duration:  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial base period of twelve (12) months with up to four (4) option perio ds of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.<BR>

All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.

The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Astana, Kazakhstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $80 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $300 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and conflict mitigation, and health and education.  The Mission works in partnership with over 120 grantee and contractor teams.

B)  STATEMENT OF DUTIES:

1)  Summary

The incumbent serves as the USAID/CAR Cultural Affairs Advisor.  He/she will be based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, will focus on CAR, and may also provide services to embassies/USAID missions outside of Central Asia, in coordination with the Europe and Eurasia (E&E)/Asia Bureaus.  In coordination with relevant USAID and embassy staff, the Cultural Affairs Advisor will be responsible for engagement with religious communities and leaders for the overall purpose of mitigating the risks of religious conflict and extremism, through a multi-pronged approach that combines outreach, integration into broader USG programming, and opportunities for enhanced dialogues to improve the policy and regulatory framework for religious tolerance.  S/he will conduct analyses and prepare regular and special reports on religious issues, including recommendations of how such issues can be alleviated by integration into, or creation of, USAID (or USG) development assistance programs or other reform efforts.  The incumbent will identify evolving situations, conditions, and changes in the religious environment and attitudes, inclusion of religious communities, and religious tolerance / religious freedom in a country or sub-region so as to anticipate need for shifts in existing or planned programming to address those trends.  

The Cultural Affairs Advisor interacts with government officials, religious scholars and leaders, local government officials and NGO leaders, as well as other people of influence in the region.

<DESC>Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services, Pantex, LLC (B&W Pantex) is seeking companies experienced in the underground installation of high-density polyethylene pipe (HDPE) for fire suppression systems.  Further to the goal of B&W Pantex to utilize small businesses, B&W Pantex will allow small businesses to team with other companies (small business to large business) to perform this project.  B&W Pantex is interested in a company that has core competencies required for the opportunity at hand, a proven track record for performance, a good safety record, and the necessary financial stability to bond this project and perform the work.  Other teaming relations one might consider are:  mentor prot?g? and small business to small business.  

BACKGROUND:
B&W Pantex is the Prime Contractor of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Pantex Plant located near Amarillo, TX.  

PURPOSE:
This contract will provide construction services for the replacement of approximately 11,000 feet of the High Pressure Fire Loop (HPFL) underground piping and valves at the Pantex Plant.  The HPFL supports the critical safety function of nuclear and non-nuclear facility fire suppression systems by supplying water to meet the system design requirements.  The HPFL is designed to meet the highest demand for quantity, pressure, and flow of a single facility sprinkler system.  

SYSTEM DESCRIPTON:
The HPFL is a water distribution system comprised of two earth-covered, grade-level reservoirs of 360,000-gallon nominal capacity, two pump facilities, and a distribution system of pipe arranged in a loop and grid plan.  Only one tank and one diesel-driven fire pump located at the same pumping facility are required for the HPFL to be operable.  The HPFL is installed and maintained solely to provide non-potable water to site fire suppression systems. The distribution pipe is arranged to afford at least two flow paths to each facility on the grid with ample valves to isolate sections while maintaining water supply to the remainder of facilities.  The current HPFL distribution pipe consists predominantly of ductile and cast iron pipe. Pipe sizes range from 6 inches to 14 inches in diameter. Fire hydrants are distributed throughout the areas served and are supplied water by the HPFL system.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to enhance the reliability of the HPFL. The facilities rely on the HPFL to provide fire protection water in accordance with the Pantex Plant Design Criteria Manual (PDCM), the Fire Protection Design Criteria Manual (FPDCM), the site-wide Safety Analysis Report (SAR), and the site Technical Safety Requirements (TSR). 

The Contractor shall furnish equipment, material procurements, construction services, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing mark-ups and NQA-1 project documents) for the HPFL project.

SCHEDULE
Construction shall be completed no later than 730 calendar days from Notice of Award.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Replacement Autopilot System, Flight Director, Radar Altimeter (RA) and potentially Angle of Attack (AOA) systems for 417 KC-135R/T and 2 OC-135B Special Purpose Aircraft

NOTICE TO INDUSTRY: This RFI is for planning purposes only.  The 827 ACSG understands that components of the proposed C/KC-135 Block 45 Modification program are discussed within this RFI.  The proposed Block 45 Program remains on track for a release of a Draft RFP in the near future.  This RFI does not necessarily change the current Bock 45 modification program in its current form (Digital Flight Director, Radar Altimeter, NVIS, and Aeromedical).

PURPOSE
The 827th ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to remove the existing Digital Autopilot System (ASW-48), ALQ-141 Flight Director, AL-101 Radio Altimeters and potentially AOA systems and install a replacement dual Digital Autopilot (DA) System with Flight Directors (FD), RA, and AOA systems together with associated components (hardware, software, etc).  The installations for these efforts will be as a block, not separate stand alone installations.

DESCRIPTION
The KC-135R/T and OC-135B aircraft autopilot, flight director and radio altimeters need replacing due to obsolescence, poor reliability, and high maintenance costs.  Replacement DA with FD, RA and AOA systems should use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) equipment to the maximum extent possible.  The modified aircraft must meet current and planned FAA and ICAO requirements including, but not limited to:  Worldwide capability and certification with Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.15 (total system accuracy of 0.15 nautical miles 95% of the flying time).

New systems must:
- Maintain existing airworthiness certification
- Be protected against electromagnetic pulse
- Ability to store and provide any detected faults and provide maintenance crews with fault verbiage

The proposed dual DA with FD must provide the following capabilities:
- Integrated 3-dimensional guidance and/or control for all navigation/approach solutions and provide for aircrew cueing and warning via the currently installed integrated multi-function displays and cockpit warning systems
- Expandable and upgradeable to support future growth toward 4-dimensional navigation, auto-throttles, integrated altitude alerting, and category landing capabilities
- Continual crosschecking 
- Vertical navigation (e.g. provide the ability to bring the aircraft to approach from cruise altitude) while providing airspeed or throttle queues to the aircrew for airspeed deviation through annunciation (there are no auto-throttles on the KC-135)
- Autopilot system should receive and provide digital outputs to all associated systems with the exception of those requiring servo, synchro, or other analog signal inputs
- When installed, the system will be able to accept aircrew-selectable air refueling receiver type profiles to allow autopilot to compensate for incoming receiver aircraft, reducing the number of un-commanded autopilot disconnects
- Dual autopilot control panels
- Provide dual surface sensing at the horizontal stabilizer
- Perform yaw control on OC-135 aircraft and potentially on KC-135R/T (replacement KC-135R/T yaw control must include engine failure Assist system and series yaw damper functions).
- Ideally use the existing MAX and AL-CL take-off profiles.

The proposed RA must provide the following capabilities:

- New receiver-transmitters and coax cables
- Low probability of intercept mode or ability to turn off emission.
- provide altitude inputs to all equipment currently supported, while providing digital altitude data to the new DA systems
- redundant data to all systems now using AL-101 data.

The successful partner must offer a line of staplers to satisfy this light, medium, heavy duty, offering; and meet and/or exceed the FAR and other published Federal standards, including Executive Orders and applicable agency-unique requirements. To be considered for this commercial partner opportunity, the following criteria, at a minimum, must also be met:

Extra consideration will be given to the manufacturer?s willingness to assist by reducing the procuring cost of any manufacturing equipment and/or component parts.  
3)	Willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement, which includes on-going technical and production assistance while enabling the selected nonprofit agency to meet the suitability criteria of the AbilityOne Program in the production process by supplying component parts of the various staplers for assembly by blind employees, and providing training and instruction in the proper assembly techniques to complete the manufacturing and packaging process; thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.

Because the Committee?s authority to establish fair market prices is separate from its authority to determine the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee does not consider comments on proposed fair market prices for commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List to be pertinent to a suitability determination.
6)  Willingness to work with the selected nonprofit agency, NIB or NISH and the Committee to ensure that the products? price to end-users is a fair and reasonable price.

<DESC>The VA Upstate NY Network (VISN 2) facility at Buffalo, NY intends to award a firm fixed-price contract for the development and implementation of a valet parking system, including all staff, materials, and labor, at the facility. Sources are being solicited to identify any potential vendor capable of performing this work who holds the necessary technical competencies and evidence of an acceptable past performance record.  Potential offerors must be established companies with a verifiable record of recent past performance of valet services at large, urban facilities experiencing parking congestion.   Potential offerors will be required to visit the facility to provide offers in response to any RFP released as a result of this Sources Sought notice. Potential offerors will be required to prepare a full analysis and breakdown of their proposed valet parking plan, based on current space restrictions at the facility and proposed Government-provided valet parking spaces.  This proposal/plan will be part of the evaluation factors for any RFP released as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  There are an estimated 125 parking spaces that will be set aside for contracted valet services, though this number is subject to change before or during solicitation. Potential offerors must be able to perform the services described herein at the VA Western New York Healthcare System Hospital, 3495 Bailey Ave., Buffalo NY.  The potential offeror does not have to be based in the Buffalo area, but will need to be able to provide local staff with which they have experience, attend meetings and site visits on short notice, and respond in-person to inquiries or requests by the Contracting Officer.   Potential offerors must be capable of performing their own background investigations, including but not limited to inquiries of employee driving records, drug screenings, criminal record checks, and employment history.  Government background investigations may also be administered. Contractor will be required to provide all materials necessary for provision of services outlined in their proposed valet parking plan. The Government will require any potential offerors to provide proof of insurance that meets and possibly exceeds industry standards for this type of work.  The Government will include language in this contract that holds the contractor responsible for any loss of personal property or damage to vehicles or facilities as a result of performance under this contract. In addition to parking staff, potential offerors will be required to provide supervisory personnel that are located at the VA Hospital on a daily basis to oversee operations and respond to any concerns/requests of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.   If at least two responsible sources are identified that fulfill the same socio-economic category, the Contracting Officer may set this solicitation aside.  If no responses are received, or there is no level of response adequate to justify a socio-economic set-aside, the Contracting Officer may release this solicitation to the open market. Under the provisions of PL 109-461, if only one Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Business or Veteran Owned Small Business concern is determined responsible and offers reasonable pricing, the Contracting Officer may set this work aside to negotiate a sole-source award.  Multiple SDVOSB or VOSB responses deemed able to perform this work may result in a competitive set-aside.   For more information on this matter, please contact the contracting officer, Jason V. White, at 716-862-6004.   This solicitation is anticipated to be released within thirty days of the close of this notice.  The NAICS Code will be 812930 - Parking Lots and Garages, with a small business size standard of $6.5 Million.

<DESC>General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Needle and Syringe Combination. <BR><BR>This new RFRIAQ supersedes the previous solicitation for Safety Needle/Syringe Combination solicitation number W81K02-07-T-3013 wh ich was posted on April 30, 2007, closed on May 21, 2007, and cancelled on June 14, 2007. The new closing date for this posting is January 1, 2008 and this date is established due to a change in the clinical evaluation process. The change in the process in cludes a requirement for clinical in-servicing by the vendor prior to the clinical evaluation at Tripler Army Medical Center. All responses to this solicitation must be resubmitted fresh before the closing date of January 1, 2008. No prior submissions for this product line in any previous FBO will be considered or evaluated.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U .S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Cente r Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA cl ause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor  program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is November 2008. The evaluation w ill be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Cheryl Janus, RN TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, Cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Produ cts & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needle and Syringe Combination. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $146,437. This fo recast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of t he product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in part icipating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/t ime of this solicitation. Failure to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in t ransmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, a llowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. Th is board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without dis cussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this ann ouncement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition am ong vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I: <BR>Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase II: <BR>The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluate d at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th ) business day after the notice to ship. Failure to deliver samples by the requested deadline will result in exclusion from the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, using a  one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = not acceptable, Three (3) = acceptable, and Five (5) = highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a  non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) prior to the use of their Safety Needle and Syringe Combination. Vendors who cannot provide on -site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will be excluded from the standardization process. In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. The TPRB's rationale for in-servicing of this product group, for the TAMC cli nicians, is based upon the multiple clinical training venues, the constant rotation of staff and the use of rotating contract personnel.<BR><BR>Vendors will also be required to provide product literature, training aides and teaching materials to Naval Hosp ital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam and US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks.  The TPRB's support of this training option is based up on the stability of the clinical staff at these MTFs. Failure to provide product literature, training aides, and teaching materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center.<BR>1.	Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC. One vendor per week will be e valuated.<BR>2.	The TAMC CPT Clinician will coordinate the scheduling and location of the presentations. This individual will work with the vendors in scheduling the training activities.<BR>3.	Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the staff. A present ation reviewing the  technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use  the device will be addressed.<BR>4.	Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations,  or guidance regarding the product.<BR>5.	All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>The following steps are the training aid clinical evaluation process  for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa and the US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks:<BR>1.	Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to 	the clinical evaluation. <BR>2.	Day 1: the staff will review all liter ature and teaching aides provided by a vendor.<BR>3.	Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted.<BR>4.	Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance.<BR><BR>Phase III: <BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation ar e completed and analyzed, all vendors will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

<DESC>General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Surgical Scalpels and Blades (Disposable). <BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the c linically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Tr ipler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is par t of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial  agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Prog ram and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is Nov 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Cheryl J anus RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR>   <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Surgical Scalpels and Blades (Disposable).  For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $16,110.00. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail  address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Failure to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requi rements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price quotes. <BR><BR>Due to the poten tial for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is  advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Ev aluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the decid ing officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this annou ncement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on comm itted volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the eva luation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I: <BR>Vendors will respond to the FBO posting by e-mailing their interest in participating in the stand ardization process to the POC listed on the FBO. The TRBO will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from the vendors. Vendors will provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria. The technical/company criteria are weig hted equally. The TPRB clinicians will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria. <BR><BR>Phase II: <BR>The TRBO office will request clinical evaluation sample set and product literature from the vendors. The vendor will be required to send the no charge samples directly to the participating MTFs. Failure to meet the deadline for sample arrival will result in exclusion fro m the standardization process. Vendors will be given 21 calendar days in which receipt of the samples at the MTF must occur. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by close of business, 4 p.m. local time, on the twenty first calendar day after the no tice to ship. Failure to deliver samples by the requested deadline will result in disqualification from the standardization process.<BR><BR>The TPRB clinicians participating in the evaluation will form their team and evaluate the product against the clinic al/performance criteria in the clinical setting. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type format with a 1-5 scoring format. The scale   descriptors are: One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Fi ve (5) = strongly agree. All clinical criteria are weighted equally. <BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their Safety Scalpel and Blades. Failure to pro vide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The TPRBs support and TAMCs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of Peri Operative Registered Nurses  Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and cus tomary.<BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide training materials to NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and 18th MDG, Kadena. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be  in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive pr ior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The clinical representatives, on the TPRB, from NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and 18th MDG, Kadena, opt ed to exercise this option for the training and guidance of the clinicians who will use the samples. This option is another method used to support the government's minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for Tripler Arm y Medical Center. Each vendor will have a full work week, in the TAMC Operating Room Suite, to represent their Safety Scalpel and Blades. Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing at TAMC on the first day of the work week. This in-servicing  period will be delivered to the Operating Room staff, as a whole. Day #1: The formal in-service program by the vendor for their devices will be presented. After this formal in-service episode, the vendor serves as a clinical consultant to the surgical cli nicians in the Operating Room. The remainder of that day and for the remaining work week, the vendor will be available, within the Operating Room, to serve as a consultant on the surgical   application of their devices. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will b e conducted. The vendor will be available for consultations and guidance regarding the product.All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>Clinical evalua tion process for NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and 18th MDG, Kadena: Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation. The Pacific Region TPRB clinical representative, from each of these MTFs, will select the appropriate providers for this evaluation. They will proctor and monitor the clinical evaluation process. Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teaching aides provided by a vendor. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be condu cted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance.<BR><BR>Phase III: <BR>All vendors participating in the clinical evaluation will be asked to submit lowest price quote for analysis. Vendors will be given 7 calendar day s from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of this region. Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration. <BR><BR>The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (post-standardization costs), (2) Potential cost avoidance, (3) impact of unmatched lines, and (4) consideration of SKUs by each vendor. Due to the potential for ba se DAPA prices to be inflated, the impact of RIA prices on the region is considered more important than other pricing elements.<BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain  the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contai n the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request rev ised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>The vendors will e -mail the price quote to the TRBO via e-mail in the prescribed format. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price will becom e more important.<BR><BR>1.

<ARCHDATE>03182008

<DESC>The U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) has teamed with the Fort Bragg Directorate of Contracting (FBDOC), Army Contracting Agency-Southern Region to develop an enterprise solution that addresses the national environmental support requi rements of IMCOM, to include the U.S. Army Environmental Command (USAEC), IMCOM Regions, and IMCOM Garrisons/Installations.  An analysis of IMCOMs procurement of environmental services concluded that a more strategic or enterprise-wide approach could be e mployed to obtain environmental services in support of IMCOM in order to limit the impacts of diminishing resources across the Army.  USAEC has developed four (4) separate Draft Performance Work Statements (PWSs) in the enterprise areas of Environmental Co mpliance, Cultural Resources, Natural Resources, and Management/Professional Services.  Each draft PWS and a copy of this sources sought can be found at http://aec.army.mil/usaec/business/index.html.  This web site will also be used to release future draft  documents for comment to industry.  The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish separate multiple award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract suites consisting of a basic ordering period of one (1) year and four 1-year optional ordering periods for each enterprise area.  Task orders will be competed strictly within the context of each enterprise area multiple award ID/IQ contract.  The estimated program ceiling (over 5 years) for each enterprise area is as follows:  Environmental  Compliance - $230M, Cultural Resources - $45M, Natural Resources - $105M, and Management/Professional Services - $190M.  The estimated program ceiling reflects the total value of all actions to be conducted under that multiple award enterprise ID/IQ contr act suite.  <BR><BR>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek capability statements from interested small businesses in order to reaffirm the initial research that it may be possible to set-aside all four (4) of these enterprise ID/IQ contracts for performance by Small Businesses (to include information on the possible participation by Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses).  Responses from Large Business to this Sources Sought Notice are not required a t this time.  <BR><BR>While each of the enterprise contracts is separate and distinct from the others, the FBDOC is only issuing a single Sources Sought Notice.  Contractors may respond to more than one of the enterprise areas; however, they must submit se parate responses to each area as detailed below.  The conceptual acquisition strategy includes an Organizational Conflict of Interest restriction on the Management/Professional Services enterprise contract.  This means that contractors that compete on that  enterprise area will be precluded from competing on contracts in the other areas and vice versa.  <BR><BR>The Environmental Compliance enterprise approach will consist of tasks that will assist the Army in complying with federal, state, local, Department of Defense (DOD) and Army requirements for air and water pollution control, regulated waste management, toxic substance management, sampling and monitoring, project management, and process improvement.  Representative performance objectives will include co mpleting permit applications or revision requests, assessing spill or construction sites for contamination, recommending pollution control technology and strategies, training facility personnel, developing and implementing sampling strategies, creating or revising required plans, surveys, and studies and implementing compliance or pollution prevention projects.  <BR><BR>The Cultural Resources enterprise approach will consist of providing technical assistance to the Army and other military components with cu ltural resources requirements in three broad categories:  (1) Survey, inventory, or investigation of historic properties and cultural resources, (2) Mitigation of adverse effects to historic properties and cultural resources, and (3) Program and execution of cultural resources management activities. <BR><BR>The Natural Resources enterprise approach will consist of providing technical assistance to the Army and ot her military components with natural resources requirements to include two broad categories of services:  (1) Survey, inventory, or investigation of natural resources and (2) Program and execution of natural resources management activities. <BR><BR>The Man agement/Professional Services enterprise approach will consist of providing technical assistance to the Army and other military components with management and professional services requirements in three broad categories: (1) project and professional manage ment services; (2) studies, analyses, and evaluation services; and (3) engineering and technical services.  Within the context of these broad categories the contractor may be required to support the development of environmental requirements in support of o ther programs.  The contractor may also be required to support the Government in the inspection, verification, or validation of the work of other contractors.  <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.  The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice nor reimburse participants for information they provide.

<SUBJECT>J--Request for Information.  Operation & Maintenance of the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  This is to request industry comments on the following Statement of Objectives, to assist the Government in developing its acquisition strategy. Submit comments to msanford@do.usbr.gov by December 31, 2007. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE I.	Introduction The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), is planning to issue a Request for Proposals for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the newly constructed Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility (BGNDRF) located in Alamogordo, New Mexico, for a period of one year beginning October 1, 2008.  Four one (1) year options may be exercised subject to Reclamation's mission to include onsite Government contractual oversight.  The program is sponsored by Reclamation's Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development Program (DWPR).  Through this program, Reclamation is forming partnerships to address a broad range of desalting and water purification needs.  The intent of the program is to augment the supply of usable water in the United States through innovative, efficient, and cost effective desalination and water purification technologies.  The O&M Contract (Contract) for the BGNDRF is a Performance-Based Management Contract (PBMC).  The application of performance-based contracting approach emphasizes results and minimizes the "how to" performance descriptions.  The Contractor has responsibility for total performance under the Contract, including determining the specific methods for accomplishing the scope of work by; (1) adhering to all contract and subcontract requirements; (2) providing the Government sound recommendations; (3) obtaining proper Government approvals; (4) quality work efforts by implementing and coordinating administration, operation, maintenance, and laboratory responsibilities; ensuring timely deliverables; and (5) assuming accountability for the listed in Section V herein.  The performance-based requirements of this Contract are broadly set out in this Statement of Objectives and reflect Reclamation's minimum needs and expectations for Contractor performance.  Accordingly, this PBMC provides flexibility to the Contractor in operating and maintaining the BGNDRF.  All proposals submitted pursuant to this request shall include a detailed Performance Work Statement that describes how the Contractor will achieve the Performance Objectives listed in Section V herein. II.	Background The United States is faced with the challenge of providing sufficient supplies of safe water to its citizens now and in the future.  Factors such as prolonged droughts, rapid population growth, competing user demands, and environmental and health concerns place additional stress on available water resources.  Desalination of brackish or impaired groundwater has the potential to increase usable water supplies by producing water suitable for municipal, agricultural and industrial applications.  Further improvements can be made through research and development in desalination for inland urban, rural, and remote applications to lower costs, improve technology performance, and to manage the concentrates removed from the water.   The impetus to create a desalination research facility to address these needs began in 2001 when Congress directed the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), in cooperation with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), to conduct a study and prepare a plan for a desalination research and development facility in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico (U.S. Congress Committee on Appropriations, 2001). The BGNDRF is designed to provide state-of-the-art research facilities for Reclamation and visiting researchers involved in desalination research studies, pilot-scale projects and small demonstration projects.  The BGNDRF will also offer public tours and feature an information display area as part of its public awareness program.  The BGNDRF is a major federal research center, unique in that it is the only major research facility in the United States dedicated solely to the desalination of brackish and impaired groundwaters.  It is located within an appropriate environment for desalination research, the Tularosa Basin.  The Tularosa Basin possesses an adequate supply of groundwater resources for research purposes and a wide range of water qualities.  The BGNDRF is intended to be a key national focal point for cooperative research in brackish groundwater desalination since it officially opened in 2007.  The mission of the BGNDRF is to be the intellectual powerhouse that attracts outstanding researchers to work on developing cost effective, efficient desalination technologies that, when applied to brackish and impaired groundwaters, result in new supplies of usable water for municipal, agricultural, industrial, and environmental purposes.  The BGNDRF is also dedicated to bridging the gap between science and engineering, and to speed the transfer of supply enhancing technologies to users.  In bridging the gap, the BGNDRF has the opportunity to be involved, when appropriate, in studying the impact of non technological barriers such as financial, institutional, environmental, and regulatory issues. The BGNDRF will pursue its mission of supply-enhancing technologies by initiating research projects that:  "	Develop robust desalination technologies with extended life cycles that can effectively treat groundwater without fouling.  "	Lower the costs of desalinating brackish groundwater through the development of new and improved technologies. "	Improve the operational performance of desalination technologies for increased output. "	Develop solutions to concentrate management problems. "	Develop renewable energy/desalination hybrids. The BGNDRF's goal is to be a national resource focal point for the desalination of brackish and impaired groundwaters.  The BGNDRF will follow the Research and Investment Criteria contained in the President's Management Agenda, which provides relevance, quality, performance, and industry relevant applied research and development criteria for research programs (OSTP/OMB, 2003, 2005). The BGNDRF will become an integrated part of Reclamation's existing desalination research and development program.  As part of a comprehensive effort, it will fill a unique role and it will draw upon the expertise and research activities already established.   In addition to the general objective of developing supply-enhancing desalination technology, the BGNDRF will use four specific research objectives to select and guide its research programs: 1.	Developing solutions to concentrate management problems 2.	Developing renewable energy/desalination hybrids 3.	Developing desalination technologies for produced waters 4.	Developing economically viable small-scale desalination systems The objectives listed above are not intended to be totally inclusive, as research efforts at the BGNDRF may be focused on emerging or disruptive technologies or processes not currently identified. III.	Location and General Description The 17 million dollar facility is located within the Tularosa Basin in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  A central research building and external research areas are situated on a 40 acre fenced site within Alamogordo city limits and about 4 miles east of Holloman Air Force Base.  The BGNDRF is easily accessible by car from Albuquerque, New Mexico (north), Las Cruces, New Mexico (west) and El Paso, Texas (south).  A number of major airlines service both El Paso and Albuquerque, while small commuter flights fly directly into Alamogordo.  The facility location was chosen to effectively conduct activities that would support national and international research on inland brackish ground water desalination.  Because of its supply of groundwater resources with a variety of water chemistries, this site provides a unique opportunity to evaluate new desalination technologies.  In addition, there is close proximity to sources of produced waters.  The address for the BGNDRF is: The Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility 500 Lavelle Road Alamogordo, New Mexico 88310 The central research building is designed as a passive solar facility encompassing an area of 15,350 square feet.  The building contains six research bays for desalination technology pilot testing, a resource area and information center for visitors, a monitoring room, offices, a conference room, a water analysis laboratory, and a mechanical shop. The information center is located in the lobby of the building, equipped with a large screen multimedia display, a viewer area, and information displays.  Here information on desalination and ongoing BGNDRF research projects can be presented.  Tours of the facility can be staged in the information center and move through the research bay area and external research areas. A high bay area in the rear of the building houses six research bays, a workshop and storage areas.  Each bay is equipped with quick release connections so that pilot-scale research units can easily be hooked up to water, power, chemicals, instrument air, data ports and drain.  Each bay has access to three different water qualities available from onsite wells and storage tanks.  One of the bays will be equipped with a working reverse osmosis unit that is used as a demonstration unit for public tours.  The bays can accommodate more than one research experiment at a time depending upon the characteristics of the specific units under investigation. Researchers can use the adjoining monitoring room or research offices to gather and analyze data from their research projects in the bays or from three large external pads located behind the building. Researchers can use the monitors and controls to detect a failure and to take the necessary actions to resolve the problem.  Large glass windows enable researchers to view all of the high-bay area. There are seven offices for researchers working at the facility. Most of the offices can accommodate two researchers comfortably.  Each researcher will have access to the Internet, as well as use of the phone, fax, and a copy machine.  The office areas are clustered together to provide a team-based environment.  The conference room provides a professional atmosphere for meetings and presentations for up to 15 people.  The conference room will be available for small-group workshops and seminars. A basic laboratory is available for researchers to test and analyze water samples obtained from research projects.  The laboratory is equipped with calibrated analytical equipment to ensure the reliability and accuracy of test results.  Safety measures such as exhaust hoods, emergency eyewash stations and protected utility connections are designed to protect users. All on-site systems can be monitored from the central research building.  Limited centralized controls will also be available for start up and emergency shut down procedures. Four onsite source water wells supply water to the BGNDRF for research purposes.  Water is pumped to large water storage tanks where it is stored and distributed to individual research bays as needed.  Internal research bays can be supplied with up to 30 gallons per minute for pilot-scale testing while the larger external pads can accommodate larger demonstration units operating at up to 60 gallons per minute.  Brackish groundwater sources containing a variety of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations will be available for research: "	Low TDS source water o	50,000 gallon source water storage tank o	TDS of 1,000-1,200 mg/L o	Temperature before cooling tower stripping of 41 degrees C (106 degrees F) "	Mid TDS source water o	100,000 gallon source water storage tank o	TDS of 3,350-6,400 mg/L "	High TDS source water (Needs to be trucked to site from nearby sources) o	50,000 gallon source water storage tank o	TDS of 10,000mg/L or greater including produced waters Reclamation obtained perpetual water rights of 500 acre-feet per year and an additional reserve well from an adjacent ranch.  This well will be rehabilitated and brought online as needed in the future. The well produces mid-TDS source water which is typical of brackish groundwater found throughout the Southwest. The 40 acre site also contains three large evaporation ponds to store the concentrates separated from the product water by research test units.  The ponds will be used to conduct concentrate management research studies and pilot-scale testing, i.e., beneficial uses of concentrate, byproduct development, and zero liquid discharge systems.  The evaporation pond area is fenced for safety reasons and instrumented to detect any leaks in the liners.  An agricultural research area is located adjacent to the evaporation ponds.  It is designed for research into salt-tolerant plants or halophytes. One part of the site has been set aside for future renewable energy research into solar and wind power units coupled with desalination technologies.  Wind turbines or solar panels can be positioned in this area and connected to the onsite water and power networks as needed.  The BGNDRF's research building and external features are designed for flexibility in meeting the needs of any research study conducted at the BGNDRF.   IV.

<SUBJECT>J -- Vertical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Equipment Storage
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Coast Guard intends TO PROCURE CONTRACTOR SERVICES TO STORE, MAINTAIN AND MANAGE VUAV EQUIPMENT (Bell Eagle Eye) inventory procured as contractor furnished equipment under USCG Deepwater contract DTCG23-02-C-2DW001.
Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (Bell) has established a storage area within its facilities and has invoked inspection and maintenance procedures to keep the material procured for the USCG Deepwater VUAV program in operational status for application to the VUAV program as required.  Bell has received and inspected all items procured during the contract against program specifications and requirements in accordance with the contractual requirements.  Bell has maintained all items relative to their flight readiness as part of the inventory storage at its facility. 

The removal of the inventory from Bell?s facility will require Bell to re-inspect all items upon their return to Bell in the future and will increase the risk that various items will be declared non-flight-worthy and will have to be re-ordered.  The re-inspection may include requesting evidence from the USCG?s supplier that particular items were stored and maintained in accordance with Bell?s procedures.  If the evidence cannot be provided or the evidence does not conclusively show that the item was stored and maintained in accordance with Bell?s procedures, Bell will have to declare that the items are not flight-worthy and place a new order to replace these items.



NOTE 22. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with BELL HELICOPTER under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority of the test program for commercial items Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501(a)1(ii),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to K&R Custom Software, Inc., 739 Thimble Shoals Blvd. STE 302, Newport News, VA 23606-3562.

1.  The 6th Communication Squadron requires technical maintenance/software support for K&R?s previously installed, maintained, and populated Telephone Management System (TMS).

2.   The award of a contract for TMS technical maintenance/software support must be awarded to K&R Custom Software, Inc. because they engineered the TMS data base currently in use specifically to interface with MacDill AFB MSL-100 Telephone Switch.  Due to proprietary rights and configuration knowledge it would prevent other companies from providing maintenance support and system upgrades unless system replacement takes place.  Current replacement of the system is not cost effective for the government.

3.  Market research was conducted for the purchase of TMS Maintenance and K&R Custom Software, Inc. is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Tuesday, December 18, 2007, the award for TMS System Maintenance will be made to K&R Custom Software, Inc.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  No solicitation is available.  This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.<BR><BR>The US Army, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CE RL) issues this Request for Information regarding software vendors with interest in implementation of the Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBIE).<BR><BR>BACKGROUND<BR><BR>CERL has, in conjunction with the National Building Informatio n Model Standard (NBIMS) (www.nbims.org), developed an information exchange format to assist in the electronic transfer of construction documents and information to facility operators.  This format, called COBIE, has been published by NBIMS as a working gr oup product. COBIE deliverables are currently being incorporated by several federal agencies into their design/construction contracts, and a growth in the inclusion of COBIE deliverables in federal contracts is anticipated as agencies incorporate the use o f the Building Information Model (BIM) into their facility programs.  Through COBIE designers and contractors are able to directly capture information that is required by facility operators.  Prior to the use of COBIE this information was exchanged in mult iple volumes of paper, or e-paper documents.<BR><BR>The COBIE working group included representatives from designers, builders, facility operators, software vendors, and service providers.  While membership in the COBIE workgroup was open, notices requestin g wide participation were not distributed by NBIMS.  As a result, discussion of COBIE was limited to those already participating in the NBIMS effort.<BR><BR>References for the COBIE work group format may be found on the Whole Building Design Guide (http:// www.wbdg.org/om/cobie.php).<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI Notice is to gauge what level of interest there might be among the general software and service provider industry in the COBIE format.

If possible respondents are to provide two samp le COBIE data files demonstrating their capability to produce and/or consume COBIE data.  These sample data files may be used for compliance testing and should be sanitized to remove any proprietary or location-specific references. <BR><BR>TIMELINE<BR><BR> Responses to this RFI Notice must be submitted by 11 January 2008, 1700 hours, Central Time Zone to the addressee shown at the bottom of this Notice.<BR><BR>DISCUSSION<BR><BR>All respondents, including those who do not provide a complete submission package , will be invited to attend a meeting in Chicago, IL on 20 Feb 2008.  The location of the meeting will be announced to respondents no later than 8 Feb 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The NAICS Code is 443120.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Microsoft, Inc., 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington, to acquire Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) that will provide professional Information Technology (IT) support to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) for software maintenance, for a period of one year with two (2) successive 12-month option periods.  HHS is seeking professional support services for its Microsoft enterprise software.  CIT operates and manages HHS enterprise software license agreements, including the HHS Microsoft EA, which is utilized by HHS Operating Divisions (OPDIVS) including NIH, CDC, FDA and ITSC.  CIT recently renewed the HHS Microsoft EA which provides software maintenance for over 80,000 computer desktop machines and laptops, as well as several hundred servers.  To further support users under the HHS Microsoft EA, the Microsoft MCS will include the following tasks:  (1) Assessment and Review Services, including in-depth evaluation of business requirements, plans, architectures, and designs of operational systems and environments; (2) Planning, Architecture, and Design Services, including assisting HHS OPDIVs in creating plans for technical architecture as well as design infrastructure and mission-critical applications; (3) Proof-of-Concept Services, including providing a limited functionality project prototype to assist HHS in mitigating risks and accelerate the formation of a project team prior to development or deployment; and (4) Custom Solution Services, including assistance in customization to meet unique HHS needs according to established best practices and procedures.  CIT has determined that Microsoft is the sole source that can provide the required consulting services to support the HHS Microsoft EA software applications.  The required consulting services are proprietary to Microsoft which has no authorized commercial re-sellers.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their services which will be considered by the agency.     Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide consulting services to support Microsoft EA software applications that can fulfill all the task requirements specified above.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.  Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within nine (9) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM Synopsis No. 08-043-MJK shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO:  Maxwell J. Kimpson, Contract Specialist.  Inquiries regarding this notice may be made to Email kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov and Phone (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service has a requirement for the completion of a Nutrient Management Plan, Conservation Plan, and Recordkeeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation as part of a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities which, when combined into a system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource conservation goals are achieved for animal feeding operations.  The Nutrient Management Plan involves developing nutrient budgets (for all sources of nutrients used on the farm) based on crop needs, existing soil nutrient levels, and soil nutrient thresholds. The plan will include appropriate documents and field maps that identify the land base necessary to effectively utilize the manure produced.  The Conservation Plan includes the development of conservation and management practices required to minimize the movement of nutrients on the landscape and conserve the nutrient value for crop production.  This includes the planning and design of practices that address tillage and crop rotation systems, erosion and runoff control and conservation buffers.  Record-keeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation includes the collection of soil/manure samples, evaluating planned crop nutrient needs, calculating appropriate manure application rates, calibrating equipment and filing appropriate records for documentation.  Place of performance will be in various counties within South Dakota.  NAICS code is 541620.  Complete packages with 2 copies (3 total) are due by January 11, 2008 at 2 PM in the State Office at Huron, SD.   Successful proposals may result in multiple awards.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This procurement is being made in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12, FAR Part 15, and FAR Part 16.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-08-R-MOT010 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09. The NAICS code is 611699. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) will award a single Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) type contract for Tactical Operations Program Management Support and Tactical Training services.  The period of performance for the base period is eight (8) months from the date of award, and four (4) one year option periods and one four (4) month option period, not to exceed a total of 5 years.  The services will be ordered through task orders containing Firm-Fixed price (FFP) and Time-and-Materials (T&M) contract line items (CLINS).  The contractor shall be required to provide services in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). 
Current Coast Guard course training materials will be provided to the Offeror who is awarded this contract and course curriculums and materials shall be revised and updated by the contractor during the performance period of this contract.  Inspection shall be in accordance with FAR 52.212-4.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall read and follow the directions given in provision 52.212-1, particularly the submission of past performance information pursuant to 52.212-1(b) (10). In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, and the selection factors listed below as an addendum to FAR 52.212-2, the Government will award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, is most advantageous and offers the best value to the USCG. The USCG will evaluate offers based on the following factors which are an addendum to FAR 52-212-2: 1) Relevant Experience/Proposed Personnel with current expertise in military special operations (e.g. Counterterrorism), Federal or State government law enforcement special weapons, tactics, and training (e.g. Hostage Rescue, High Risk Warrant, Counter-Assault), or Tactical USCG Units operations and training in accordance with the PWS requirements. Resumes of contractor personnel proposed for this procurement shall be evaluated as part of this evaluation factor.  A clear demonstration that personnel hold the required security clearance must be apparent on the respective resumes; 2) Relevant Past Performance on same or similar procurements performed within the past three years or in progress.   Include three references consisting of the contract number, the agency or company for which the work was performed, contract value, a description of work performed, and the name of the Contracting Officer and Technical Representative to be contacted with their address, telephone, and facsimile numbers.  The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the quotations received; and 3) Price.  Selection for award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value for the Government using the tradeoff continuum in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. The trade off analysis will be made using proposal information provided for the three evaluation factors listed above. In the trade off analysis the importance of all non-price evaluation factors above are in descending order of importance and, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Offeror proposals shall have three separate sections: Section 1 will include the response to Relevant Experience/Proposed Personnel; Section 2 will contain the response for Relevant Past Performance information; and Section 3 will contain the proposed Price information.  Total contract ceiling price will be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404-1b. The total contract ceiling is derived by multiplying the maximum FFP quantities by their respective unit prices and then summing those totals along with the T&M ceiling prices.  Evaluation of the option periods shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Offerors are required to submit at least 3 Relevant Past Performance references. Current, accurate, complete information MUST be provided to contact each reference. This should include contract number, point of contact, phone number and email address for each contact.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS)  develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)1 and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(c), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content). 

1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.

2. Requiring Office: United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Information, Policy and Public Affairs (IPPA) Division, Office of Information Systems.

3. Description of Action - The BOP, IPPA Division has a requirement for the renewal of the site license and continued maintenance/support of the Saba Learning Management Software (LMS) system, which is only available from Saba Software Incorporated.

4. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency?s Needs - Inclusive of the Estimated Value - Saba will renew the existing LMS software license and provide additional software maintenance and support. The estimated value of the site license renewal and software maintenance/support for LMS software system is not expected to exceed $86,644.00.

5. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

6. Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP currently utilizes the LMS Software for the agency?s training management system. The LMS software is owned by Saba and is a rights protected system. As such, the software maintenance and support can only be acquired from the software developer.

7. Efforts to Obtain Competition - The Contracting Officer will publish the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition and issue a combined synopsis/solicitation in the Federal Business Opportunities (fedbizopps.gov). The combined synopsis/solicitation will offer notice of its intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Saba and request information from interested parties.

8. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination A comparison of the anticipated prices to the Government with the published market prices of similar items was conducted by the Contracting Officer. The anticipated maintenance and support price is $86,644.00. Typically, software manufacturers charge 10% to 20% of the software purchase price for software maintenance and support. The anticipated costs for the LMS software support and maintenance fall within the range typically charged in the commercial marketplace for software maintenance and support services. Therefore, the Contracting Officer expects the price to be fair and reasonable based on established market pricing.

9. Market Survey - FAR 10.001 - Market Research was conducted by both the requiring activity and Contracting Officer. It has been determined that Saba is the only contractor with the capability to offer software maintenance and support services for the LMS system.

10. Other Factors - Saba has designed and developed the LMS software system.  The LMS software system is data rights protected and may not be reproduced or utilized in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, without written permission from Saba.  The BOP has a requirement for software support and maintenance and Saba is the only available source who can fulfill the BOP?s requirement. 

11. List of Sources - Saba Software Incorporated owns the proprietary rights to the Learning Management Software and is the only authorized reseller of the software.

12. Action to be taken to Promote Future Competition - Saba owns the proprietary rights to the software code.  The Government can recommend the firm allow resellers to provide maintenance and support services for the Saba LMS system. 

13. Technical Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

//s// Earl Franks, Chief, IT Planning and Development

14. Contracting Officer's Certification - I hereby certify this request for Justification and Approval of Other than Full Competition is made in good faith, the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

//s// Donald G. Sinsel, Contract Specialist, National Acquisitions Section

15. Concurrences - I certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

//s// Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section

It is the Contractor's responsibility to keep pace with Burial & Graveliner Installation activities of the Fort Custer National Cemetery. The Contractor shall place the graveliner 30 minutes prior to burial services and will remain on site and in close proximity to NCA excavation crews until all graveliner covers are in place. Normally several crews are used daily for excavations which will result in graveliners being installed at different Sections of the cemetery.  Fort Custer National Cemetery uses grave sites measuring 6' x 10' in new burial Sections. This will require exact preciseness in placement of all graveliners. (a)	Placement of Orders: Orders for concrete Grave Liners at Fort Custer National Cemetery will be placed by the COTR or designee. Orders may be faxed to the contractor at the COTR's discretion. (b)	Inscriptions:  Date of manufacture shall be inscribed on both box and lid.  Should be visible from the end of the box and lid.

(Note: If a product is manufactured to metric dimensions and those dimensions exceed the tolerances specified in the inch-pound units, a request will be made to the VA Contracting Officer, in conjunction with the COTR, who will accept or reject the product).

Changes in schedules, work assignments or delays of daily operation must not occur under any circumstances. A.3	DELIVERY (a)	The Contractor is to be at the Cemetery not less than thirty (30) minutes prior to scheduled interment.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Program Operations Specialist - Resources Team in Washington, DC.

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide Attachments 1 and 2 as referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

Confidential business information may include technical data as that term is defined in DFARS  252.227-7013(a)(14), 252.227-7015(a)(4), and 252.227-7018(a)(19). It may also include computer software as that term is defined in DFARS  252.227-7014(a)(4) and 252.227-7018(a)(4). (b) The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) may release to individuals employed by SPAWAR support contractors and their subcontractor's confidential business information submitted by the contractor or its subcontractors pursuant to the provisions of this contract. Business information that would ordinarily be entitled to confidential treatment may be included in the information released to these individuals. Accordingly, by submission of a proposal or execution of this contract, the offeror or contractor and its subcontractors consent to a limited release of its confidential business information. (c) Circumstances where SPAWAR may release the contractor's or subcontractors' confidential business information include the following:  (1) To other SPAWAR contractors and subcontractors, and their employees tasked with assisting SPAWAR in handling and processing information and documents in the administration of SPAWAR contracts, such as file room management and contract closeout. (2) To SPAWAR contractors and subcontractors, and their employees tasked with assisting SPAWAR in accounting support services, including access to cost- reimbursement vouchers. (d)  SPAWAR recognizes its obligation to protect the contractor and its subcontractors from competitive harm that could result from the release of such information. SPAWAR will permit the limited release of confidential business information under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) only under the following conditions: (1) SPAWAR determines that access is required by other SPAWAR contractors and their subcontractors to perform the tasks described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2), (2) Access to confidential business information is restricted to individuals with a bona fide need to possess, (3) Contractors, their subcontractors, and their employees who are granted access to confidential business information have signed an appropriate non- disclosure agreement requiring them to provide the same level of protection to confidential business information that would be provided by SPAWAR employees, (4) Contractors and their subcontractors having access to confidential business information have agreed under their contract or a separate corporate non- disclosure agreement to provide the same level of protection to confidential business information that would be provided by SPAWAR employees, and (5) SPAWAR contractors and their subcontractors performing the tasks described in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) have agreed under their contract or a separate non-disclosure agreement to not use confidential business information for any purpose other than performing the tasks described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2). (e) SPAWAR's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act are not affected by this clause. (f) If SPAWAR satisfies the conditions listed in paragraph (d), the contractor and its subcontractors agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, including attorneys fees, court costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, display, or disclosure of confidential business information provided by the contractor to the Government. (g) The contractor agrees to include, and require inclusion of, this clause in all subcontracts at any tier that requires the furnishing of confidential business information. H-360  STATE SALES TAX EXEMPTION (OCT 2003) (a) The contractor's price shall not include state sales tax, unless the location of the contractor's business is in a state that does not afford the Federal Government a tax exemption status under its state and local laws (e.g., Arizona, Hawaii). The contract price excludes all state and local taxes levied on or measured by the contract or sales price of the services or materials furnished under this contract. (b) To the extent that the guidance in FAR Part 31 and DFARS Part 231 applies to this contract, such tax or duty shall not constitute an allowable cost under this contract, unless specifically permitted by the Contracting Officer. (c) Contractors may be taxed by a state or local authority when procuring goods and services for performance of this contract. Such taxation does not constitute a tax levied on the Federal Government; rather it is a tax levied on the contractor for which the contractor is liable. However, the Federal Government is exempt from state and local taxation. Therefore, the contractor shall state separately on its invoices taxes excluded from the contract price, and the contracting officer agrees to either pay the amount of the taxes to the contractor or provide evidence necessary to sustain an exemption. (d) No exemption certificate is required. L-349,  Submission Of Electronic Proposals: (a) Offerors shall also submit their proposals electronically to SPAWAR under the instructions contained in this provision.  Offerors shall submit their signed proposals as either scanned ("TIFF") or "PDF" documents.  Electronic copies shall be submitted via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central  (SPAWAR E-CC).

**CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS**

1) Is the tower base (at an erection location) to be of mass concrete or otherwise as we can also supply a wide steel base as an alternative which makes for ease of relocation

ANSWER:     A WIDE STEEL BASE WOULD BE PREFFERED FOR RELOCATION PURPOSES.     HOWEVER, THE BASE MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN UP TO 70 MPH WINDS AS OUR RANGE HAS PERIODS OF EXTREME WINDS.

2) Why do you want embossed aluminum sheet on the inside and the outside of the booth walls and on the floor? We normally use steel sheet for the walls and steel checker plate for the floor.     

ANSWER:     STEEL OR ALUMINUM WILL BE ACCEPTABLE.

3) Can we offer an alternative for the booth and tower sizes so that they can fit into a standard ISO shipping container? This makes for a very significant difference in the shipping costs. 
     
ANSWER:     IF THE BOOTH SIZES ARE RELATIVELY THE SAME SIZE AND THE TOWER IS STILL AROUND 20' THERE SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.

4) There is no reference to insulation of the roof or the walls of the booth and we want to clarify this.     

ANSWER: INSULATION WILL BE ACCEPTED BUT PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS IS A LOWEST PRICED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE PROJECT

5) Is this a Single Phase 100 Amp load center with 12 circuit breaker spaces and a main breaker?     

ANSWER:     THIS CONFIGURATION IS ACCEPTABLE.

- Is the electricity supply for the HVAC unit to be 230 Volt single phase 60 CPS? 

ANSWER: YES 

- The grating deck mentioned is to be alongside the door only or all the way around the booth?     

ANSWER: GRATING DECK SHOULD BE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BOOTH IF THIS DOES NOT OVERLY INCREASE COSTS.
