Mr. Onions is the only known source with the required specialized expertise that covers the variety of requirements that can be immediately applied.

The project applies to Hickam AFB and occasionally to other USAF installations on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. This project will be procured on an unrestricted basis. Basis of award will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with technical evaluation factors. A competitive best-value source selection will be conducted in which the competing offerors' past performance history, and response to the Technical Evaluation criteria, when combined, will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost/price considerations.

The work is required in support of Base Civil Engineer activities. The contract will include a wide variety of paving tasks as listed in the Unit Price List, which will be further priced with the Contractor's coefficient.

The total performance period for the contract will be 12-months for the basic contract period and four 12-month option periods. The total duration of the contract will be 60-months. The total guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 would apply only to the basic contract period. The maximum annual contract amount over the lifetime of the contract will be estimated at $25,000,000.00. There is a $5,000 minimum delivery order limitation; the maximum delivery order limitation is a total of $500,000.00 for a single item, and any combination of items in excess of $1,000,000.00 in any year of the contract. The Government will evaluate offers and select the awardee who is most responsive and responsible and whose proposal offers the best overall value to the Government. In responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis, please indicate (a) type of Business concern (Large/Small), disadvantaged, 8(a), or HUBZone status; (b) provide evidence of recent (within past three [3] years) and relevant experience in work similar in type and scope and include contract numbers, project titles, contract value, and; (c) availability of bonding of at least $5 million for this project. It is anticipated that the solicitation for this project will be issued electronically on or about 12 Mar 2009 on the Government's Electronic Posting System (EPS) at www.fbo.gov. You must register on that site in order to receive notification of changes to the solicitation. The Government will not provide copies of the solicitation, specifications, drawings, etc. Requests for solicitations by telephone or e-mail will not be honored. All prospective eligible Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov in order to be eligible for a contract award. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dunn &amp; Bradstreet. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award. The Pre-Proposal Conference and closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.
