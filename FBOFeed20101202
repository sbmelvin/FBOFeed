The contract is intended for use with items for which recurring demands may be anticipated, as a means of reducing the time and expense required soliciting and making repetitive awards. Based on the indefinite quantities the awarded may receive awards on unknown quantities for the award year, with a guaranteed minimum and a stated not to exceed maximum. The contract may be for a term of one year with four option years. Further it may contain an option to extend the term of the contract. If an option to extend the term of the contract provision is included in the solicitation, each option term would be one year. However, the total contract term (base year plus options) will not exceed five years. The answer to the questions concerning pricing will be one of the factors that will help the Government to determine the term of the contract.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the goals of the Laboratory of Translational Genomics is to dissect the genetic basis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validated in large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach will identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect. To accomplish this goal, thousands of patient DNA samples are sequenced each year to identify common gene variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This genotyping is done using a well-established, high-throughput sequencing platform that utilizes ABI Prism&reg; BigDye&reg; Terminator (BDT) cycle sequencing chemistry.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard in $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for twelve months with two twelve month option periods.</p>
<p>The Surveillance Research Program (SRP) has developed a series of statistical methods for the analysis of spatial patterns in cancer data.  These include a spatial scan statistic (SaTScan), a spatial outlier detection tool (MGPS), a median-based spatial smoother (Headbang), and a spatial-temporal model of cancer incidence.

<a href="mailto:Rechenberg.Kathleen@epa.gov">rechenberg.kathleen@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, NRMRL, APPCD located in Research Triangle Park, NC seeks sources to provide retrofittability assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technologies for coal-fired power plants. The objectives of the proposed project are to evaluate the technical feasibility of retrofitting GHG technologies to coal-fired power plants and to provide quantitative assessment of space requirement, parasitic energy consumption, boiler modification, heat integration, cooling tower load, flue gas purification (additional SOx, NOx, Hg, and particulate reduction), waste handling, and secondary emissions of the most promising GHG mitigation technologies.
The candidate mitigation technologies should include post-combustion (e.g., amine and chilled ammonia processes), oxy-fuel combustion, and pre-combustion (e.g., integrated gasification combined cycle or IGCC). The solicitation number SOL-CI-11-00007 will be solicited under full and open competition with the NAICS code designation for the acquisition being 541330.  It is anticipated that a Fixed-Price contract will result from the award of this solicitation.  It is expected that the need for the possible services will be required over a 12 month period beginning in December 2010.
Statement of Work
1. Background
APPCD?s Air Pollution Technology Branch is responsible for conducting research to investigate potential GHG mitigation technologies for coal-fired power plants. The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of issues related to retrofitting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation technologies to existing coal-fired power plants in the United States. 
The current fleet of U.S. coal-fired power plant has a capacity of 332 GW, supplies around 50% of the nation?s electricity. Collectively, coal-fired electricity generation represents 33% of total U.S. CO2 emissions. Due to the relatively low cost and long lifespan, it is expected that those power plants are going to continue to operate for decades. Thus, an effective strategy for achieving significant and cost effective reductions in CO2 emissions requires the deployment of GHG mitigation technologies to retrofit existing coal plants and reduce their CO2 emissions. Traditional R&D efforts focused on the development of innovative and exploratory GHG technologies. The full-scale application of those mitigation technologies to existing coal-fired power plants involves significant and practical issues yet to be addressed.
The objectives of the proposed project are to evaluate the technical feasibility of retrofitting GHG technologies to coal-fired power plants and to provide quantitative assessment of space requirement, parasitic energy consumption, boiler modification, heat integration, cooling tower load, flue gas purification (additional SOx, NOx, Hg, and particulate reduction), waste handling, and secondary emissions of each GHG mitigation technology.
2. Period of Performance
Award through December  15, 2011.
3. Description of Tasks
The contractor shall assess the retrofittability of the most promising GHG mitigation technologies for coal-fired power plants. The candidate mitigation technologies shall include post-combustion (e.g., amine and chilled ammonia processes), oxy-fuel combustion, and pre-combustion (e.g., integrated gasification combined cycle or IGCC). The major issues to be investigated shall include space requirement, parasitic energy consumption, boiler modification, heat integration, water consumption, cooling tower load, flue gas purification (additional SOx, NOx, Hg, and particulate reduction), waste handling, and secondary emissions of each GHG mitigation technology. 
Task 1: 
The contractor shall identify the potential units in the USA that are candidates for model plant evaluations. The candidate plants shall be categorized and reviewed based on their existing facility, size, age, location, and proximity to sequestration site. A representative plant from each category shall be selected and used for evaluation as a model plant.
Task 2:
The contractor shall evaluate GHG mitigation technology retrofit issues focusing on each model plant. The retrofit issues shall include but are not limited to:                                                                                                                    
- Upgrade of existing air pollution control systems such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR)  and wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) to provide adequate flue gas quality for GHG mitigation.                                                                      
- Secondary discharge (multimedia) and treatment required once GHG mitigation process is installed.                                                                                                                               
- Balance of plant impacts especially focused on auxiliary power consumption and opportunities for improved thermal integration of the retrofit option.                                
- Natural resource requirements such as additional plot space required and increased water consumption.     
Task 3:
The contractor shall conduct detailed engineering analysis to assess the retrofit potential, critical parameters and their uncertainties.  An appropriate basis consisting of relevant metrices (e.g., age, size, natural resource requirement) shall be developed to determine fractions of utility boiler population that can be retrofitted with specific controls.  
Task 4:
Develop quality assurance documentation as required in Appendix #1 to this Statement of Work. Work involving environmental data shall not commence until the quality assurance documentation has received official approval from the EPA Quality Assurance staff via the Project Officer.
4. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria
The draft final report must be peer-reviewed by EPA and the contractor must respond to all the EPA peer-reviewers? comments before the final report is accepted. 
5. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables
Meetings with the Project Officer: Monthly conference call meetings will be held the first week of each month after purchase order. 
Progress Reports: The contractor shall prepare and publish a quarterly progress report after purchase order. 
Draft and Final Reports: The contractor shall prepare and submit a draft final report 10 months after purchase order.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby authorized pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements .

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 19, Rocky Mountain Network Contracting Center (RMCCC), Glendale, Colorado.  

2.  Nature/Description of Action.

Two Bookwalter Retractor Instruments for an estimated cost of $28,482.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

The Bookwalter Retractor Instruments will allow the Office of the Operating Room to accomplish a mission objective of providing surgery for General Surgery patients needing use of the Bookwalter Retractor.  This system is used to hold/retract the abdominal wall open during all major laparotomy surgical cases, retracting so that the surgeons can operate without having to hold the body cavity open with their own hands, giving visualization. Potential based on workload history is at least twelve cases per week. ` These retractors must have two oval and round rings, two horizontal bar assemblies, two extension columns, two BW light weight table clamps 12", twelve low profile rotilts, four post coupling 1x1, sixteen tilt ratchet mechanisms, four malleable blades w/lip medium, four Kelly blades 2 x 4, four Kelly blades 2 x 6, four baulfour blades, four Harrington blades, four KL blades 2 x 2, four Kelly blades 2 x 3, two segmented rings-me.   This retractor frees the surgeons up to locate the site of surgery and quickly do the procedure.  This saves time that the patient is not under anesthesia/ and gives more time to schedule surgical cases.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c) (1) implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.501(a), "Sole Source Acquisitions." FAR 6.302-1-- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

Johnson & Johnson is uniquely qualified to provide these services to The Veterans Affairs Medical Denter (ECHCS) based upon the following:

a. The Medical Center Staff General Surgery surgeons have been trained on use of the Bookwalter Retractor System. This system has been in use in the Operating room for many years. Johnson & Johnson is the sole supplier of the Bookwalter Retractor Instrument sets that can be used for open abdominal cases.  We use it not only for general surgery cases, such as open abdominal bowel cases, but also for urology and vaginal cases.  Our General Surgeons found that two more retractors were needed to accommodate the increase in cases and the turn-over time it takes to process these instruments.  We recently ran into a problem when we did not have enough retractors that were sterile for weekend emergency cases, since all of the retractors were used on a Friday and not sterilized in time for the weekend procedures. Each Bookwalter retractor is unique in its size and shape according to which anatomical part of the body it is retracting.  This retractor will be used for the abdominal cavity.  See attached letter from Codman. Instruments from other companies are not interchangeable with Bookwalter.

b. They (Codman) are the only approved vendor of the Bookwalter Retractor System in addition to having exclusive rights to the Bookwalter name.  The Medical Center purchased Bookwalter retractors many years ago and the Two Bookwalter retractors contemplated for purchase are manufactured and distributed solely by Johnson & Johnson.  No other manufacturer's instrument retractors will function properly with the Bookwalter Retractor system and would therefore pose a direct risk to the success of the operation and the patient's life/health.

c.  Johnson & Johnson is the only manufacturer and distributor of this product.  Other companies will not be compatible with the technology and instrumentation of this product. Attached is a letter from Codman/Johnson & Johnson stating that they are the sole manufactures and distributors of the Bookwalter retractor systems.  The Bookwalter Retractor Instruments are utilized by General Surgery, Gyn, and Urology surgeons involving open abdominal cases and therefore future requirements are anticipated, however the quantities and frequency cannot be defined at this time.  All parties will work to establish an appropriate long-term contract for the requirements.

d. The Staff General Surgery, GYN, and Urology surgeons have been trained with the Bookwalter Retractor system and have purchased many sets prior to these.   We presently own the sets.  Only one company can provide these items. Attached is a letter justifying that this retractor is the best value.  We do not have a contract with Bookwalter for these retractors; however, the company has come down in price with the final quote, which is fair and reasonable.  The attached letter states that the company is aware that other companies are selling inferior knock-off versions of the Bookwalter.  Codman has not approved any other manufacturer and has not granted any license to these companies to use the Bookwalter name.  Codman recommends that only Bookwalter parts from Codman be used in conjunction with other Bookwalter Retractor Systems.  Other companies cannot supply these items. We presently have multiple Bookwalter retractors and need two more.
6.  FedBizzOpps Announcement/Potential Sources.

This action will be synopsized and published in the Government Point of Entry (GPE), FedBizzOpps.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.

The Contracting Officer determined that the anticipated cost to the Government to be fair and reasonable based on resent previous purchases of like items.   Previous purchase from Johnson & Johnson P.O. 554-10-4-068-0505 for similar items were determination to be fair and reasonable based on pricing of the present Bookwalter Retractor System to be purchased.


8.  Description of Market Survey.

Market research has demonstrated that at this time the identified manufacturer is the sole source for this system requirement.
   
9.  Any Other Supporting Data.

N/a
         
10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

At this time, this J&A is being processed in advance of the synopsis posting on FBO.  If responses to the synopsis indicate additional sources are available, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible sources.

The manufacturer for this system only sells direct and does not have a distributor network so we cannot generate a list of sources other than the manufacturer.

Salient Surgical
180 International Dr.	
Portsmouth, NH 03801
 

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

None. Should it be determined that VISN 19 has a future requirement for this type service, the Contracting Officer will conduct a market survey to fulfill such requirement.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for business, functional, and technical services to support additional aspects of the Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to HealthCare (EVEAH) Initiative.  The TAC intends to award a sole source firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract via modification to Ray Group International, 100 South Ashley Drive (Suite 1700), Tampa, Florida 33602, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) pursuant to authority 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), Veterans First Contracting Program and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, "Authorized or required by statute."  The services consist of functional analysis, project planning, technical support, and other similar services that are essential to planning, controlling and operating a large, complex initiative.  The EVEAH initiative, one of the Secretary of Veteran Affairs' (VA's) sixteen (16) transformational initiatives, focuses on eliminating disparities in access to care wherever they exist within our system.  VA has already transitioned certain care from inpatient to outpatient settings where technology solutions safely permit, through telemedicine, in-home care, and other delivery innovations.  The VA will continue to focus on the gaps for underserved Veteran populations, and on expanding their access so that every Veteran can get the care they need-at the right place and the right time.  The EVEAH initiative includes outreach efforts to proactively identify and communicate with Veterans who may be eligible for services, but may be unaware of the benefits to which they are entitled or do not know how to enroll for such benefits.  Additional aspects to the EVEAH initiative have been added that were not previously included in the initiative.  These additional aspects require business, functional, and technical services.  These additional aspects to the EVEAH initiative include Annual Surgery Updates (ASU), Absent Sick in Hospital (ASIH) software updates, Emergency Department Integration System (EDIS I & II) enhancements, Veterans Implant Tracking and Alert System (VITAS) enhancements, and National Utilization Management Integration (NUMI).  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541990.  The estimated date of award for this action is December 31, 2010.  

This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals.

Questions concerning this action can be addressed to Kristine Callaert, Contract Specialist, kristine.callaert@va.gov  and David Nostrant, Contracting Officer, david.nostrant@va.gov.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST&nbsp;FOR INFORMATION:<br /></span></strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes issued by the C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The United States Air Force (USAF) is requesting information on Internal Cargo Lighting for the KC-135 R/T model aircraft.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE:<br /></span></strong>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry for options of Internal Cargo Lighting for the USAF KC-135 R/T aircraft.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br /></span></strong>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.<br />The Government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. However, should proprietary information be submitted, it should be marked "PROPRIETARY", and will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:<br /></span></strong>The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic missions. Cargo compartment lighting on this aircraft is inadequate for efficient use by crew members. Due to this inadequacy, a permanent, non-handheld light source capable of illumination by crew members is required to improve cargo compartment lighting. This lighting should enhance safety, cargo loading/unloading operations (floor/pallet), passenger carrying, and aero-medical mission operations. Zone lighting that eliminates or reduces the potential disturbance of other personnel is desired.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: <br /></span></strong>The requirements listed below are viewed to be an integral part of any technical solution proposed in response to this RFI. All improvements, deviations, and modifications of these requirements should maintain the intent of the original requirement.<br /><br />1. The lighting system will provide visible spectrum light of adequate intensity capable of illuminating the cargo area.<br /><br />2. The system should require no modification of main aircraft structure. Ancillary structure may be used for hardware attachment.<br /><br />3. Some testing required IAW MIL-STD-810 or DO-160. Specific areas of concern include explosive atmosphere, vibration, temperature and shock.<br /><br />4. Based on previous light solution implementations, Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology is the preferred light solution. Fiber optic, incandescent, and fluorescent lighting have undesirable traits which lend these lighting types to be of secondary consideration.<br /><br />5. Lighting color should be white with no tint or tinge of other color. It may be advantageous to include other modes of color; however the primary mode must be pure white.<br /><br />6. IAW with OSHA Standard 29CFR1926.56(a), Light intensity will be 30 foot-candles or more. Light should be of adequate intensity to perform all mission operations. Any quantification or qualification of lighting will include foot candle measurement. <br /><br />7. Lighting should be focused on cargo or pallet interior. Use of reflectors and diffusers should be documented as well as the impact on intensity.<br /><br />8. Lighting solutions could be achieved by means of temporary installation, permanent lighting system solutions or a permanent installation with temporary augments. Specifically, the solutions can be categorized in one of three options as follows: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 1: Permanent lighting (NVG compatible)<br /></span>Emergency power backup supplied by contractor<br />28vdc aircraft power<br />Zone lighting control</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 2: Portable lighting carry on kit (NVG compatible)<br /></span>Emergency power backup supplied by contractor<br />28vdc aircraft power<br />Zone lighting control<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 3: Permanent lighting with temporary augment (NVG compatible)<br /></span>Emergency power backup supplied by contractor<br />28vdc aircraft power<br />Zone lighting control</p>
<p>[Within all three (3) of these options, consideration should be given to ease of installation, cost and maintenance.] <br /><br /><strong>Note: All three (3) of the above solutions and/or lighting options should be addressed and incorporated within the RFI responses received.<br /><br /></strong>9. Lighting equipment must not interfere with mission operations such as cargo loading passenger transportation and normal aerial operations.<br /><br />10. The current aero medical mission utilizes three patient support pallets. A zone lighting concept is preferred. At a minimum, this should involve one zone per pallet and one zone for the boom area for a total of four zones. The entire cargo area should be covered by this area, beginning with the galley/latrine area and ending at the boom area.<br /><br />11. Lighting controls should be easily accessed. Lighting controls should be placed in the galley area and at the forward edge of each patient support pallet. The forward lighting control should be able to turn all lights on and off. The lighting controls at each pallet should be able to turn the lights on and off for the corresponding pallet zone.<br /><br />12. The light solution should provide a dimming feature. This should provide varying degrees of intensity from off to fully illuminated. Dimming may be provided in steps or continuous. Dimming control should be incorporated into lighting control at each pallet.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: <br /></span></strong>The KC-135 cargo compartment operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, resistant to moisture, and approved for in-flight use. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: <br /></span></strong>Primary power source should be aircraft power. The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power, single-phase 28VAC, and 28 VDC. Lighting solution should include provisions for operating on the ground with no external or generator power available.&nbsp;The KC-135 has two 28 VDC batteries. The dissipated power should be minimized to avoid complete battery discharge. Lighting controls should be easily accessed and operated. <br />Lighting that is compatible with night vision goggles is not required but is desirable.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL APPROACH:<br /></span></strong>Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed portable internal cargo lighting system. Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address all potential risks. Describe the type of training that will be required to operate the proposed system. Briefly summarize how personnel would operate the system. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COMPATIBILITY:</span></strong> <br />Explain system compatibility. Describe any limitations. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING:<br /></span></strong>State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COST:<br /></span></strong>Provide the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, for all three (3) of the lighting solution options detailed in Requirement # 8 above, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AVAILABILITY:<br /></span></strong>Provide system availability information. Give information detailing if the equipment is available off-the-shelf immediately. If equipment is not available provide lead time for component acquisition. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAST PERFORMANCE:<br /></span></strong>Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this RFI addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work). <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE:<br /></span></strong>Services to include research and development, technology insertions, system integrations, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support, logistic support services, and engineering support. Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrade and operational support costs.<br />The information you provide may be used by the USAF to consider planning, program phasing and tailored technical requirements. Your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any manner. Although the identification of contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information that is received as a result of this RFI. Your participation in the RFI will not affect your company's position during any solicitation, nor will this RFI be used as criteria for the prequalification of respondents for future solicitations.<br />Through this RFI the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or emerging technologies which meet the requirements. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This RFI is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contracting Office Address:<br /></span></strong>OC-ALC/GKCK<br />3001 Staff Dr. STE 2AE1 86A<br />Tinker AFB OK 73145-3020</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<BR><BR>Three Dimensional and Holographic Display Systems  <BR>Technology Roadmap and Current Market Survey<BR> <BR>Medical Simulation Applications <BR><BR><BR>Purpose for the Request for Information (RFI):<BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for contract.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to survey Industry, Academia and Other Government Agencies (OGA) in order to collect information and data that would be useful for an assessment of the current technological level present in the display market as well as the development of a comprehensive technology roadmap for the development of holographic and 3-D display capabilities with specific application to medical simulation domain.  Companies, universities and agencies interested in pursuing future research and development opportunities with the U.S. Army are invited to respond to this RFI.  [NOTE:  If travelling to Orlando, in the near future, capability briefings and technical interchange meetings with the Government are possible, with sufficient advanced notice.  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred]. <BR><BR>The Roadmap will be a planning tool that addresses research, development, technology insertion, production, fielding, and effective use of 3-d and holographic display systems for medical simulation and training.  Upon completion, the Roadmap will be a living document that will support:<BR><BR>* Identification of R&D trends within private industry, academia and other government agencies, in the field of augmented reality and related technologies.<BR><BR>* US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements writers in the assessment of current and future army training requirements and identification of technology gaps and shortfalls.  <BR><BR>* US Army Medical Command, AMEDD Center and School, and other government medical instructional organizations in supplementing curriculum with current display technologies<BR><BR>* US Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) Science & Technology (S&T) managers in developing suitable and effective display solutions that address identified technology shortfalls. <BR><BR>* US Army's planning, funding and future implementation of Army Technology Objectives (ATOs), Science and Technology Objectives (STOs), Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, Technology Demonstrations (TDs), etc. in this technology area.<BR><BR>* Open dialogue for the leveraging of internal research and development (IR&D) efforts of industry, academia and other government agencies, towards current and future Army Force Operating Capabilities and Technology Shortfalls.<BR><BR>This survey covers a seven year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution period including FY10 (Current Year), FY11 (Next Year) and period FY12 through FY17 (Future Years Defense Plan).<BR><BR> <BR>Research Vision:<BR>Current holographic and 3-d technology is hindered in the reliance on the use of glasses to achieve a 3-d effect, or having large 'stage-like' displays using mirrors to create a hologram. The Army is interested in 3-d and/or holographic displays which are unencumbered by glasses or bulky display configurations. The vision of the research is to an autostereoscopic, fully parallax system with sufficient resolution and refresh rate in order to properly display high-fidelity medical images, both dynamic and stationary, to supplement current medical curriculum. <BR><BR>Background:<BR>      The 3-D and holographic displays currently being developed will place a new capability into the hands of the Soldier, with uses including mission planning, debriefing, or simulation and training.  Currently, static holograms, or Tactical Digital Holograms (TDH), have been developed which allow Soldiers to visualize 3-D environments. The additional capabilities of a dynamic display, entitled the Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD), will allow for moving objects and the manipulation of virtual objects by the user. Both the static and dynamic image projections are viewable in three-dimensions without the use of glasses or other viewing device. Additionally, the image projections are fully parallax, meaning the perceived image changes as the viewing position changes.<BR>      Both the static holograms and the dynamic 3-D display (D3D) have potential uses within a variety of domains including the medical domain. Incorporating medical imaging data and anatomical models will support the training of Combat Doctors, Combat Medics, and Combat Lifesavers. Current research focuses upon a) development of next generation devices for the intuitive and team based understanding of complex datasets and b) the display of high-fidelity medical content in order to supplement the curriculum of current medical personnel. In the future, interaction with the D3D display, including positional and haptic feedback, will be developed. <BR>      The research being done will build upon earlier research done by DARPA, which initiated the topic of research and developed the initial proof of concept under the 5 year Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD) program. The research currently being conducted will further explore the use of holographic displays within the medical domain. <BR><BR>Program Objective:<BR>The Army seeks to explore methods of displaying 3D virtual objects (including medical imaging data, anatomical models, artist representations of human anatomy and physiology, etc...) to augment medical curriculum in the classroom. The capability to rapidly incorporate a variety of medical images (CT, MRI, openGL based models, etc...) into the display modality is ideal. Dynamic displays that can display motion of tissues and/or medical instruments are sought as well as static displays. Further, the capability to interact with the hologram / 3-d image is sought, utilizing existing or developing positional and haptics technology. <BR><BR>The resulting technology roadmap will support RDECOM's overall medical simulation objective, which is to improve the technology used during medical training at all levels, ranging from Combat Life Saver through Medical Doctors. Transitioning of targeted system and subsystem components to other military technology and acquisition programs is also an important objective.  <BR><BR><BR>Notional R&D Capability Objectives and Timeline:<BR><BR>  Threshold (1 - 2 Years):  3-d / holographic display prototype with the ability to display medical content <BR><BR>  Objective (3 - 5 Years):  3-d / holographic display with the ability to display numerous different medical image formats, combined with positional feedback and limited haptic interaction capabilities<BR><BR>  Long Range End-State Objective (5+ Years):  3-d / holographic display with the ability to display any medical content with full haptic and positional interaction<BR><BR>In the near future, these concepts and technologies would potentially allow for the training of anatomy and physiology. With further research, the capability to train medical procedures, including haptic feedback, using these technologies could be developed. <BR>   <BR><BR>Planned CORE R&D Topics:<BR>Based on past research efforts, the Army has identified several broad research topics that will be beneficial in incorporating 3-d and holographic displays into medical training:<BR><BR>* 3-D / Holographic Displays<BR>Investigate technologies allowing for display of 3-d / holographic medical content. The displays can be table-top, wall mounted, hand held, or other form factor. These displays should ideally be fully parallax and auto-stereoscopic. The displays should have a high resolution and rapid refresh rate, capable of displaying accurate anatomical models. The displays should be intuitive in use and operation should be achievable for most users without significant training. <BR><BR>* Incorporation of Medical Content into 3-D / Holographic Displays <BR>Investigate middleware solutions which will allow rapid integration of a variety of medical imaging formats to be visualized using advanced 3-d / holographic displays. Variants include CT, MRI, fMRI, ultrasound, DOT, and others. Anatomical models based in openGL or other graphics platform should be displayable without changes to the existing models software. <BR><BR>* Human Performance and Training Effectiveness.  <BR>Investigate techniques and programs of experimentation on human perception resultant from 3-d and holographic information presentation.  Issues may include research on design of the human system interface; prevalence of simulator sickness or other side effects, especially as a function of system characteristics or conditions of use; strategies for using 3-d / holographic technologies in medical simulation and training, and their effectiveness in both skill acquisition and transfer; fidelity requirements for effective training and transfer, etc.<BR><BR>* Haptic Feedback and Positional Sensor Fusion with Holographic Displays <BR>Haptic feedback technology is able to give a user tactile feedback from a virtual object.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSYS
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Regional Office, is in the acquisition planning stages of what might turn to be a new acquisition.  Therefore, this is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for acquisition planning purposes only and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  In addition, the information presented in this announcement does not obligate Reclamation in any manner.
All qualified concerns interested in performing the proposed project may submit capability statements for consideration. Based upon response to this announcement and capability statements, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside, proceed with an unrestricted solicitation or decide on an alternate procurement strategy. 
History Of The Proposed ProjectThe Spillway house - originally named Snacketeria, is a one-story pre-engineered light-metal building supported by an irregular concrete substructure. The substructure is founded on the existing sloped rock surface.  The building is located approximately 100 yards north of Hoover Dam, on the Nevada side and is situated on the west bank of Lake Mead.  The building was constructed in 1988 by Grove Construction (Las Vegas, NV).  The purpose for the building was to provide food service and associated amenities for the visitors to Hoover Dam during construction of the current multilevel parking facility and associated amenities, which was completed in 2000.  This building is currently the responsibility of Hoover Dam's Facility Office.   
The Proposed ProjectCurrently, Reclamation is contemplating to deconstruct the existing building and repurpose at the Central Warehouse; and to reuse the existing foundation to design, rehabilitate, and construct a high performance multi-use facility, resulting in a "Silver" rated or better certification in accordance with U.S. Green Building Council Leadership and Energy Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  The purpose of this approximately 5,000 gross square foot accessible multi-use facility and related systems, including associated parking, site work, infrastructure, and utilities, is to accommodate visitors and Reclamation employees.  The building will give Hoover Dam much needed accommodations for school groups that visit the dam providing  exhibits to facilitate their learning experience more effectively than just showing them the Hoover Dam generators.  
Key improvements that Reclamation is contemplating include: complete ADA structure; accessible restrooms; a nursing station for more expeditious response ability and flexible interior space for multiple purposes to accommodate public desire; upgraded life/safety equipment; additional exhibits including original survey boat; meeting areas; and auxiliary exhibit areas.  The building should complement the Hoover Landmark area and express the spirit and value of Hoover Dam, including the beauty and health of the natural environment. It should connect people to the outdoors with natural light and views. 
The building must be compliant with Reclamation's Guiding Principles, earn LEED certification and as well feature the latest proven sustainable technologies to reduce the energy and environmental impact of the building.
Capability Statement/PackageSources should submit statements showing ability as a prime contractor (designer, constructor, or integrated firm) of an experienced and established design-build team including architectural/engineering, interior design, exhibit design, and construction services on similar commercial buildings of a retail/educational/ or recreational nature.
Interested and qualified sources are to provide the following information as part of the capability statement:
1.  Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, and DUNS number.

Indicate whether or not you were the prime contractor, and, if you were a subcontractor, provide the name and point of contact information for the prime contractor.

<DESC>Sources Sought No. SS-CMS-2011--A110218<br />Office of Acquisition and Grants Management<br />7500 Security Blvd., C2-21-15<br />Baltimore, MD. 21244-1850<br />SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of potential small business (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) with capabilities or prior relevant experience for potential award of a contract to provide the complete spectrum of Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) recovery (overpayment) activity services. CMS is also seeking comments and feedback on the MSPRC draft Statement of Work (SOW) through a Request for Information (RFI). The work solicited includes the identification of specific MSP recovery claims, all associated recovery activities including litigation/negotiation support, related Debt collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) activities, and financial reporting. Organizations primarily engaged in investigating, appraising, and settling insurance claims, activities under NAICS code 524291- "Insurance claims investigation services", having a size standard of $7 million under SIC code 6411, should find this notice of interest.
<p>MSP recovery activities are set forth pursuant to Section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and fall under the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) under Section 1893. Due to the nature of MSP recovery efforts, the CMS believes it will gain further efficiencies by consolidating this function nationally. These efforts will not duplicate those inherent MSP activities performed by the Coordination of Benefits Contractor (COBC) or the Medicare Administrative Contractor(s) (MACs). The intent of this Sources Sought/RFI is to identify potential sources that are capable of performing the MSP recovery work and to obtain feedback on the draft SOW. <br />Background:<br />Please see attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) entitled, "Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Contractor (MSPRC) - Statement of Work (December 1, 2010)".<br />Type of Procurement:<br />CMS anticipates issuance of a Cost Reimbursement-type contract under the forthcoming solicitation. However, CMS does reserve the option to use any other procurement instrument as deemed appropriate at the time of the official solicitation. It is also anticipated that this award will be issued as one (1) base period and four (4) option periods, with a total effort of five (5) years.<br />Instructions/Requirements for Submitting Sources Sought and/or RFI Responses to CMS:<br />Interested 8(a) and small business contractors have the option to provide capability information only and not provide feedback or comments on the SOW. <br />CMS requests responses from, and encourages Small and Disadvantaged Small Businesses, having experience performing the same or similar work identified in the Statement of Work to provide a capability response to this Sources Sought/RFI. In addition to any comments provided on the SOW, your Sources Sought responses should include the following:<br />1. Business Information and Identification:<br />a. DUNS No.<br />b. Company Name &amp; address<br />c. Type of Company (i.e.: 8(a), Small business, woman-owned, veteran-owned, etc) as validated via the CCR. (All offerors must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration system, located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp<br />d. Company point of contact name/title, phone number, and Email address<br />e. Names, phone numbers, Emails of individuals who can verify the capabilities/experience identified in the responses.</p>
<p>2. Please see attachment J.7.- FY2012 Anticipated Workloads, for CMS estimates of nationwide annual workload for this effort. (NonGHP-650K cases pre-Demand/200K cases post-Demand and GHP-60K cases). Please provide a brief capability statement for your organization, tailored to demonstrate your relevant experience and/or ability to provide requirements of this magnitude. Please note that if individual capability information does not provide sufficient information for CMS to determine: (1) if the contractor has the potential to successfully perform the work described or (2) has the ability to handle the volume indicated, the evaluation of the information will reflect that the offeror did not provide sufficient information to make a determination and CMS will not include the contractor for further consideration.</p>
<p>3. Given the eventual procurement notice to be issued, offerors must be mindful of the following:<br />a. As a Small Disadvantaged Business set-aside action, the small disadvantaged business prime must be responsible for performing no less than 51% of the work (direct labor dollars) requirements with its own employees/staff.<br />b. With a cost-type procurement action, the prime must have an approved accounting system which has been reviewed by the Government and found adequate to identify, segregate, accumulate, and invoice costs. If the accounting system has not yet been reviewed by the Government, the prime must possess an accounting system which can be audited by the Government and be found adequate to perform cost-type contracting, prior to due date of proposal submission(s) under the forthcoming solicitation.<br />c. All offeror firms will be required to certify to a complete absence of any Conflict of Interest, on an organizational basis, as well as principal management and Officers of the entity.<br />d. All offeror firms will be asked to demonstrate responsibility IAW FAR 9.104.</p>
<p>4. In providing a capability package, respondees should be mindful of the requirements found within Attachment J.8. Statement of work, as well as addressing the following: <br />a.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541990 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $7 million. <br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, in conjunction with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is anticipating releasing a new solicitation for a single award of Phase IV of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). In the Phase IV contract, the contractor will be responsible for overall coordination and day-to-day management of the study; maintaining and updating a secure data base containing all study research and administrative records; provide liaison with appropriate state and federal offices necessary to conduct this research; appropriately communicate research findings to the cohort through a website and annual newsletter; and to collect specified biospecimens from selected study subjects. In Phase IV of the AHS, one contractor will perform all study related activities as there will be no cohort-wide interview conducted as part of this contract. The coordinating center will continue to be responsible for day-to-day study operations, managing and maintaining study data files, and coordinating National Advisory Panel meetings. In addition, the coordinating center will now assume responsibility for maintaining and securing the personal identifying information for cohort members; conducting annual linkages to the state cancer registries, state and federal mortality files, IRS address data bases; and facilitating add-on studies. New responsibilities under this contract will be the conduct of the Biomarker Study which will involve the collection of blood and urine samples from a subset of the cohort (approximate n=1,300) and creating a restricted access portal for all federal partners to document contract expenditures.<br /><br />The AHS cohort consists of approximately 52,000 private pesticide applicators (primarily farmers) and 32,000 spouses of private applicators from Iowa and North Carolina, as well as approximately 5,000 commercial pesticide applicators from Iowa. The pesticide applicators were recruited between 1993-1997, during Phase I of the AHS, when they obtained their license to apply restricted use pesticides; spouses were recruited largely by questionnaires brought home by the pesticide applicator. In addition to the extensive information on lifetime use of pesticides, demographic and other lifestyle factors were collected from all participants at enrollment using self-administered questionnaires (during Phase I of the AHS). Two follow-up telephone interviews have been conducted since enrollment. The first follow-up interview was conducted from 1999 to 2003 (during Phase II of AHS), and the second follow-up interview was conducted from 2005-2009 (during Phase III of the AHS). Cancer incidence has been ascertained by annual linkage to the cancer registries in each state and mortality through linkage to the National Death Index since the inception of the study field work in 1993. <br /><br />The AHS began field work for Phase I of the study with three contracts in 1993. One contract was for a coordinating center which was primarily responsible for overall coordination of the study, developing questionnaires, and providing a secure computer system to store the vast amount of questionnaire and other research data coming from the field stations in Iowa and North Carolina. The other two contracts were for a field station in Iowa and a second field station in North Carolina. Field Stations were primarily responsible for managing the distribution and retrieval of self-administered questionnaires to eligible study subjects. The coordinating center contract was awarded, via a full and open competition, to SRA Technologies for Phase II of the study and to Westat Inc. for Phase III of the study. Westat assumed the coordinating center contract during Phase II when SRA Technologies went out of business. The field station contracts were awarded via a full and open competition to the University of Iowa and Battelle Memorial Institute. <br /><br />To be deemed capable of providing the current need for the study the offeror must submit a written capability statement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: <br /><br />1. Personnel/Experience: <br />a) Experience managing a diverse group of professionals including, epidemiologists, database managers and analysts, and administrative and budgetary personnel<br />b) Experience in translating scientific reports into newsletters using lay language. <br />c) Experience conducting large field studies, biospecimen collection, interaction with advisory panels, maintaining quality and cost control<br />d) Experience working with multi-agency studies.<br />e) The offeror shall provide the name of the principal investigator, his/her professional qualifications and specific experience as a key investigator in large studies similar to the current study. <br />f) The offeror shall provide the name of the systems analyst or computer professional, his/her professional qualifications and specific experience in working with large databases. <br />g) The offeror shall demonstrate that the proposed investigation team and staff have previous experience in maintaining large and complex computer databases and carrying out the requirements of the study. The maintenance of these databases shall be in full compliance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) computer security requirements.
<p>2. Facilities: The offeror shall have the necessary dedicated office space and accommodations to fulfill the requirements. Facilities should be available for assembly, shipping, receipt, and inventory of biospecimen kits and samples. The facilities need to have protected computer services that are in full compliance with NIH computer security requirements. The location of the facility should have the ability to have face-to-face meeting with the COTR at NCI and the contractor facility.</p>
<p>3. Technical: <br />a) Trace subjects for personal identifying information, and secure this information to protect confidentiality of cohort.<br />b) Obtain data from various disease registries and databases and link these data to cohort. <br />c) Provide computer personnel and computer hardware and software to update and maintain computer databases and web-based systems. <br />d) Data management, create analytic datasets, and implement<br />quality control measures to assure high quality data. <br />e) Ensure that computer systems comply with government security regulations.<br />f) Assist and facilitate preparation and completion of various forms and reports.<br />g) Communicate with cohort participants and stake holders including developing newsletters, updating websites, and responding to inquiries on a toll-free number.

<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services within 30 days after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>Background Information:</p>
<p>The scientific mission of our section is to elucidate the function of an essential protein, eIF5A, and its hypusine modification in mammalian embryonic development, growth, and cancer.  There exist two closely related isoforms, eIF5A-1 and eIF5A-2.  Both eIF5A isoforms undergo a unique posttranslational modification that converts one of its lysine residue to a basic amino acid hypusine by way of two enzymatic steps, involving deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH).  Our recent gene knock-out study indicates that the eIF5A-1 isoform and the first step enzyme, DHS, are essential for mouse embryonic development.  However, it is unknown whether eIF5A-2 or DOHH is required for mammalian development.  To this end, we would like to generate a knock-out mouse that does not express eIF5A-2 or DOHH.  In order to do this, we constructed a vector with mouse genes interrupted with selection marker gene, to be used in generating gene-targeted ES cells by the University of Cincinnati.</p>
<p>The gene-targeted ES cells will be used in a mouse gene knock-out study in our laboratory by the contractor.  Determination of the essentiality of eIF5A-2 and DOHH by the gene knock-out study will provide critical information on the role of eIF5A and its hypusine modification in mammalian physiology, development, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Requirement:</p>
<p>The objectives of the proposal are:</p>
<p>-	Selection of gene-targeted ES cell clones and confirmation of correct gene targeting<br />-	Generation of gene-targeted heterozygous mice for eIF5A-2 and also for DOHH<br />-	Determination of the essentiality of each gene in mouse embryonic development<br />-	Characterization of phenotypes of gene-targeted mice (heterozygous and homozygous)<br />-	Characterization of mouse embryo fibroblasts isolated from each gene-targeted mouse and characterization of the phenotypes of the cultured cells<br />-	Determination of the physiological function and eIF5A-2 and DOHH in prenatal and neonatal mouse development, growth, life span, and tumorigenesis.<br />-	The targeted date of generation of gene-targeted mice is approximately 1 year from selection of gene-targeted ES cell clones and characterization may require additional time<br />Contractor Requirements:</p>

In 1999 The City of Boulder (the City), the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and the Department of Commerce Laboratories (DOC) built BRAN, and all parties entered into an memorandum of understanding. The city's ownership of the Rights of Ways does not provide that an outside vendor would be able to perform these services. The Period of Performance shall be January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documents in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent for the US Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center for a Sole Source, Firm Fixed Priced Contract W52P1J-11-Q-0003, which serves as notification to industry of this procurement. This sole source purchase order is a request for a service stemming from repairs and upgrades required on the DVIDS systems in Kuwait. The repairs and upgrades will be performed CONUS then shipped to Kuwait after system repairs and upgrades are complete.   The systems are currently in the United States awaiting upgraded amplifiers.  The contractor is allowed twenty-one (21) days to complete the requirement of repairing and upgrading the Kuwait DVIDS systems.  There are some DVIDs transmitters inoperable and awaiting parts for repair. <BR><BR>The proposed action is for a Sole Source, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Norsat International American, Inc. with a period of performance of twenty-one (21) days.  This contract will be done under Other Than Full and Open competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).

A determination not to compete this procurement based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories seeks partners for commercializing a proprietary fiber optic technology which enables power-dependent selective transmission of optical pulses. The passive all-fiber invention has potential applications in nanosecond, picosecond, and femtosecond pulsed fiber lasers, including fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers for machining and medical applications. The invention can function similarly to a saturable absorber for use in passive mode locking, but can also function as a power limiter, or isolator to reduce negative effects of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and detrimental pre/post pulse effects in amplified fiber laser systems, and may provide cost savings and improved reliability and manufacturability compared to previous solutions.
<p>It is anticipated that commercial licenses may, on a competitive basis, grant exclusive rights in pre-negotiated, defined fields of use for reasonable consideration to qualified interested parties.  Partnerships to commercialize this technology may also take the form of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) or nonexclusive commercial licenses.</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories is a multiprogram laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Company, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000. SAND# 2010-8378P</p>
<p>For further information, contact Dan Allen at Sandia National Laboratories by email, dgallen@sandia.gov, phone, 505-284-6752, or FAX, 505-284-2132.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) releases the attached Request for Proposal (RFP) pursuant a competitive acquisition for the Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC) inclusive of the future development; fielding; test; systems engineering, integration and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and refurbishment; training; and operations and sustainment support for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system and associated support facilities. For additional information regarding this RFP, reference the attached DSC Executive Summary Letter located in the Files Section herein. <br /><br />The GMD Weapon System/element is a complex system of systems consisting of hardware and software, including Ground Based Interceptors (GBIs), GBI Fire Control Nodes, GBI silos, and related flight and ground test equipment; Launch Site Components, Command Launch Equipment, and related Peculiar Support Equipment; the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System (IFICS) Data Terminal (IDT); training equipment and tactical/non-tactical communications equipment and support facilities. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance (PoP) for this acquisition is 7 years with provisions for multiple cost reimbursement type pricing arrangements including; Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Fixed-Price-Incentive-Fee (FPIF), as well as term (i.e. LOE) and completion type contract. The proposal instructions and evaluation factors for award are included in the solicitation document and are located in the Files Section herein.<br /><br />This effort was previously announced as RFP #HQ0147-09-R-0007. The potential scope described in the previous announcement was revised to include significant requirements beyond GMD operations and logistics support, and the RFP number was changed to HQ0147-10-R-0016.<br /><br />Throughout the acquisition phase, the Government has made available technical data and other information through the GMD technical data/ bidders' library. The bidders' library contains classified and export-controlled data, therefore, access is restricted to personnel who have been cleared by MDA contracting and security officials. Please note that those that have not been previously cleared for the GMD bidders' library must be cleared to receive the technical data and other documentation. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign a GMD Bidders' Library Access Agreement.

The bidders' library is available at https://dcp.mda.mil/MDDCCatalog/index.aspx.<br /><br />The MDA Acquisition Web site located at http://www.mda.mil/business/acquisition_center.html, which has been updated throughout the competitive process, is available to the public and may assist in preparation of responses.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors, i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams. Further, the government does not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts in support of the GMD Joint Program Office. However, for the purposes of this competition, the prime offeror(s) and its subcontractors/suppliers must be U.S. firms/businesses, not foreign owned, controlled, or influenced.<br /><br />As stated throughout this competitive process, the Government intends to award, on a best value basis, a contract based on the quality and the content of the proposals received. Offeror's should formulate proposals using, to the greatest extent practicable, any technical data, computer software or computer software documentation (as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014) generated in the performance of a Government contract. Therefore, all offerors are given express Government permission to use technical data or computer software or computer software documentation for which the Government has a royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable unlimited or government purpose license as established and defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014. Such clauses as those referenced herein can be found in the existing GMD contracts HQ0006-01-C-0001, HQ0147-09-C-0007 and HQ0147-09-C-0008. Determinations as to the Government's rights for any technical data or computer software generated in the performance of the referenced contracts or any subcontracts should be made in reliance upon contractor or subcontractor records established in accordance with paragraphs (g) of DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. Additionally, offerors are directed to the provisions of paragraph (k) of DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014 for matters concerning existing subcontractors, under the referenced contracts. For the purpose of existing DD 254 conditions the term "need to know" encompasses participation under this competition. The proposal must encompass and be compliant with stated requirements. Open teaming between offerors and the incumbent OEMs is encouraged; see FAR 3.301 (Reports of Suspected Antitrust Violations).<br /><br />Industry is reminded that interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when additional information, additional solicitation documentation, and any/or amendments or future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading. MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation documents or any amendments. It is the interested offerors' responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.<br /><br />Release of this RFP is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government is NOT responsible for any costs incurred as a result of this release.<br /><br />The offeror's Volume 4 (Past Performance) proposal is due to this office no later than January 21, 2011 by 3:00 pm (Central Time) and the remaining offeror proposal volumes are due to this office no later than January 28, 2010, by 3:00 pm (Central Time).

<p><br />W. ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (January2008)</p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final provisions can be accessed at http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.<br />The Section 508 standards applicable to this contract/order are identified in the Statement of Work. The contractor must provide a written Section 508 conformance certification due at the end of each order/contract exceeding $100,000 when the order/contract duration is one year or less. If it is determined <br />By the Government that EIT products and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense. In the event of a modification(s) to the contract/order, which adds new EIT products and services or revised the type of, or specifications for, products and services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template to assist the Government in determining that the EIT products and services support Section 508 accessibility requirements. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov. [(End of HHSAR 352.270-19(b)]</p>

The Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2) respectively, except that any requirement for verification of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract. <br />(4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each existing employee working in the United States who was hired after November 6, 1986, within 180 calendar days of- <br />(i) Enrollment in the E-Verify program; or <br />(ii) Notification to E-Verify Operations of the Contractor's decision to exercise this option, using the contact information provided in the E-Verify program Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). <br />(5) The Contractor shall comply, for the period of performance of this contract, with the requirements of the E-Verify program MOU. <br />(i) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate the Contractor's MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU.

<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>(a) Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: <br />(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." <br />USCG Command, Control, and Communications Engineering Center, C3CEN Portsmouth Va.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />Purchase of a VMWare Virtual computing environment for use in prototype SAROPS v2.0 installation.</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs <br />Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS) is the Coast Guard's Mission Essential Application (MEA) for use as a Search and Rescue tool. It is currently deployed as a Terminal Server (TS) application residing on a number of distributed terminal servers. SAROPS has been in services in its current configuration since 2004 and the currently deployed version is 1.3. As technology advances, so does the need for the CG to evolve its MEAs to continue to meet current and future needs. As a TS application, SAROPS is dependent on locally installed supporting applications (such as ESRI ArcDesktop). The next generation of SAROPS is planned as a Web Service (WS) application that can be accessed and run from the internet browser of any computer. To accomplish this, the existing equipment will be eventually replaced with web servers. The number of locations that web servers will be required will be about a third of the number of locations presently required in the terminal server installation. However, the computing resource required at each location will be about three times as much. To meet the demands of the of the WS installations while maintaining a reduced footprint (required rack space and power), it was determined to proceed with a blade server installation with a number of servers (web servers, application servers, database servers, etc.) operating as virtual computers on the blade installation. This virtual computer environment must meet a number of requirements in order to satisfy the MEA needs of SAROPS. The virtual computer environment must be;<br />a) Capable of supporting virtual Microsoft Windows operating systems including Microsoft DOS, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7. These operating systems must be supported in both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions where available.<br />b) Capable of being installed on physical computers with multiple CPUs with multiple cores and then being able to assign resources from that physical computer to the virtual computer.<br />c) Capable of creating virtual computers from a physical computer.<br />d) Capable of creating "snapshots" of virtual computers allowing ease of reversion to earlier state when required.<br />e) Movement of virtual computers between/among physical computers to simplify physical resource management.<br />f) Ability to change virtual computer characteristics (memory, storage, or CPU) while the virtual computer is running - i.e. no need to shutdown virtual computer to make the change.<br />g) Fault tolerance. If a virtual computer (or the physical computer for that matter) fails, fail over to an alternate computer must be handled within the virtual environment without purchase of additional applications (such as FailOver&copy;)<br />h) Load Leveling. The virtual environment must be capable of automatically sensing the VS loading and adjusting traffic in/among the VSs without the purchase of additional applications (such as Citrix&copy;)<br />i) Capable of being centrally monitored to ensure the proper operation of each VS site.<br />j) Capable of being centrally managed. All the above requirements must be able to be accomplished from a centralized location (or multiple locations) to avoid extensive travel requirements to maintain the system. <br />k) Capable of being managed/maintained by C3CEN personnel without the need for proprietary products (i.e. all items must be available as off-the-shelf).<br />l) Must be capable of incrementally upgraded as product improvements become available.<br />m) Capable of being granted CG waiver authority for installation on the Coast Guard/DHS data network known collectively as CG One.</p>
<p>There are numerous Engineering Service companies who advertise the ability to develop and install virtual computer environments to meet specific customer requirements. These installations are "turnkey" type installations that are generally proprietary of comprised of multiple applications within the virtual environment to meet all requirements. Upgrades to such systems must be referred back to the product originator and maintaining this type of installation within the C3CEN limited support resource capability was deemed too onerous.</p>
<p>There were three Virtual Computing environments that were investigated as possible solutions. They were Citrix Xen, Microsoft System Center, and VMWare Vsphere v4. While all these systems have their respective strengths, it appeared as if only the VMWare solution met all requirements. The following table reflects the evaluation of each product line. <br /><br />(table obtained from a independent comparison source - Datamation&copy;)</p>
<p>As such, a waiver request was made to the CGOne network authority for permission to install the VMWare solution on CGOne as a prototype development environment for the next generation of SAROPS. VMWare is currently the only Virtual Environment granted permission for installation on CGOne. The waiver for our prototyping installation was provided by waivers #5686819520 and #5515816334.</p>
<p>This proposed procurement is for the prototyping effort of the next generation of SAROPS and, if the prototyping effort is deemed successful, will the the first of approximately 6 similar acquisition efforts. This procurement will consist of VSphere v4 Enterprise. VSphere is licensed on a per CPU basis, and our prototype system will have 4 CPUs. VSphere cost is approximately $3,200 per CPU for a total cost of approximately $13,000.00. Included with the VSphere acquisition is ESXI (which is the virtual environment installed on each physical server also referred to as a Hypervisor) and VCentral (which is the central management software which provides centralized management failover, and load leveling capability with the Hypervisor installations). VSphere is sold with a minimum of 1 year support/maintenance agreement for an additional charge of approximately $900/CPU. As this is a development effort extending longer than 1 year, we have opted for the 3 year support/maintenance agreement with a cost of approximately $2200/cpu for a total procurement cost of approximately $22,000.</p>
<p>(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br />6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- <br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />Verbal estimates from system developers ranged from $500K per site for system development/installation. While these services would include hardware and software, they are considered outside of project budget.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a "Named Brand" product, which under the requirements of 6.302-1(b) requires a justification for other than "full and open competition" even though this product is available from multiple sources. The most important distinction here is that while many/most of the perceived requirements for our virtual environment may be provided by all three of the major virtual environment suppliers, not all are met. While each is capable of integrating all requirements within their product, each would require time and or money to provide that capability. Estimates for achieving full capability for the other two vendors range from $100K and 1 year, to $500K and never (as in there are no plans to provide that capability). Further, the CG One network authority has currently evaluated and approved only the VMWare suite of virtualization software to be installed on this network. While others may be evaluated and subsequently approved for installation on CG One, this too would require additional time and resources. Though not precisely calculatable, estimates for this effort range from $50K and 6 months - upwards. Though C3CEN may submit a request to the network authority for this evaluation and approval, it is outside the scope of C3CEN authority perform the evaluation.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. - Requirement shall be posted on FED BIZ OPS as Brand Specific, with a statement that offerors that propose/quote will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable. As determined by market evaluation, the prices for this product are consistent.</p>
<p><br />(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>There are numerous OEM outlets for this software. Including 1) VirtualizationWorks.com with a price of $3145/cpu, 2) VMWare with a purchase price of $3495/cpu, 3) En Pointe Technologies with a purchase price of $4369/cpu, 4) Carahsoft with a purchase price of $3179/cpu</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: <br />(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. <br />N/A<br />(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. <br />The CG One network authority has currently evaluated and approved only the VMWare suite of virtualization software to be installed on this network. It is outside the scope of C3CEN authority solicit additional virtualization suites without network authority. Centralization of this approving authority was instituted to avoid duplicative efforts, ensure operating systems compatibility, and to maintain standardization within the network. Procurement of this software may be made from a number of OEM vendors for this software manufacturer - including GS contracts. Duplication of the TISCOM engineering and approval of virtualization environment would be required. <br />________________________<br />(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.</p>
<p>The most important distinction here is that while many/most of the perceived requirements for our virtual environment may be provided by all three of the major virtual environment suppliers, not all are met. While each is capable of integrating all requirements within their product, each would require time and or money to provide that capability. Estimates for achieving full capability for the other two vendors range from $100K and 1 year, to $500K and never (as in there are no plans to provide that capability).

Though not precisely calculatable, estimates for this effort range from $50K and 6 months - upwards. Though C3CEN may submit a request to the network authority for this evaluation and approval, it is outside the scope of C3CEN authority perform the evaluation.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. <br />For a government cost estimate, only the sources referenced in paragraph 8 (above) were contacted for pricing.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. None at this time.</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. <br />(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008)<br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts.</p>
<p>Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are suitable for conducting repairs on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor.</p>
<p>Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />Paragraphs (b) and (c) do not apply to this solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Breakdown of the 144 days:<br />10 Holiday<br />30 Personal business, Vacation and Sick leave<br />104 Weekends<br />144 Total allowable non-working days per year</p>
<p>Example Computation:<br />Total billable days for the year were 212<br />Total non-work days were 153<br />Man Month Rate = example $18,000.00<br />Number of days per year 365 minus 144 (allowable non-workdays) = 221 billable man days (except leap years)<br />Total Cost of 12 Man Months divided by billable man days per year <br />($18,000.00 x 12) $216,000.00 &divide; 221 = $977.38<br />Contractor is responsible to reimburse the Government at the rate of $977.38 per day for non-workdays in excess of the 144 days per year<br />153 non-workdays minus 144 allowable non-workdays = 9<br />$977.38 x 9 = $8,796.42</p>
<p>10.2 Payment for Services: Man Months- The man-month rates contained in this contract are the primary compensation the contractor will receive and shall cover all expenses, prorated vacation and / or emergency leave, sick leave, holidays, applicable insurance of all kinds, general and administrative expenses, salaries of personnel including overtime, and profit, and plant shutdown days.

FY10 BAA (Phase I and II) proposals are expired with the new FY11 BAA announcement. If you would like to be reconsidered under this announcement you will need to re-submit as stated below.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field. The areas of need include:</p>
<p>1. Characterization - Proposals should focus on improved methods for effective detection, quantification, monitoring, fate and transport modeling of NAPLs and innovative methodologies for sampling, data validation, and human health and ecological risk assessments for explosive residuals at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>2. Emerging Contaminants - Proposals should include sampling and analytical methodologies or innovative treatment technologies for contaminants currently on USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations.</p>
<p>3. Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) - Proposals should describe technologies and/or methodologies that reduce the labor requirements, sampling and analyses of waste generated, energy requirements, or other costs associated with LTM programs. Such technologies could include new sensors, analytical methodologies, or statistical methods.</p>
<p>4. Pollution Prevention - Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include some quantifiable measure for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component.</p>
<p>5. Remediation - Proposals should demonstrate/validate innovative and/or sustainable technologies for enhanced recovery of mobile LNAPL, removal of recoverable DNAPL, in-situ treatment of residual LNAPL in vadose zone soils, in-situ treatment of residual DNAPL in unconsolidated soils or fractured bedrock environments, or improved treatment of explosives residuals in soil, runoff, and groundwater.</p>
<p>Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I requires completion of a 2 page proposal online form (white paper), which is found along with instructions attached to this solicitation and can also be obtained at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. Additionally the U.S. Air Force "BAA Guide For Industry March 2008" is attached and is also on the BAA website. Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 16 DECEMBER 2010. Phase I submittals received after 16 December 2010 will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3). Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs are notified electronically via email to submit a Phase II proposal; those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required. Award may be made with or without discussion. <br /><br />***Please direct all question of a contracting and technical nature to the Point of Contacts below to help facilitate better coordination. All Q&amp;A will be posted through FedBiz Ops in a timely manner. All other deadlines and information remain the same. ****</p>

The potential scope described in the previous announcement was revised to include significant requirements beyond GMD operations and logistics support, and the RFP number was changed to HQ0147-10-R-0016.<br /><br />Throughout the acquisition phase, the Government has made available technical data and other information through the GMD technical data/ bidders' library. The bidders' library contains classified and export-controlled data, therefore, access is restricted to personnel who have been cleared by MDA contracting and security officials. Please note that those that have not been previously cleared for the GMD bidders' library must be cleared to receive the technical data and other documentation. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign a GMD Bidders' Library Access Agreement. This form may be obtained by contacting Mr. Tim Cole at timothy.cole@mda.mil. The bidders' library is available at https://dcp.mda.mil/MDDCCatalog/index.aspx.<br /><br />The MDA Acquisition Web site located at http://www.mda.mil/business/acquisition_center.html, which has been updated throughout the competitive process, is available to the public and may assist in preparation of responses.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors, i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams. Further, the government does not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts in support of the GMD Joint Program Office. However, for the purposes of this competition, the prime offeror(s) and its subcontractors/suppliers must be U.S. firms/businesses, not foreign owned, controlled, or influenced.<br /><br />As stated throughout this competitive process, the Government intends to award, on a best value basis, a contract based on the quality and the content of the proposals received. Offeror's should formulate proposals using, to the greatest extent practicable, any technical data, computer software or computer software documentation (as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014) generated in the performance of a Government contract. Therefore, all offerors are given express Government permission to use technical data or computer software or computer software documentation for which the Government has a royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable unlimited or government purpose license as established and defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014. Such clauses as those referenced herein can be found in the existing GMD contracts HQ0006-01-C-0001, HQ0147-09-C-0007 and HQ0147-09-C-0008. Determinations as to the Government's rights for any technical data or computer software generated in the performance of the referenced contracts or any subcontracts should be made in reliance upon contractor or subcontractor records established in accordance with paragraphs (g) of DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. Additionally, offerors are directed to the provisions of paragraph (k) of DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014 for matters concerning existing subcontractors, under the referenced contracts. For the purpose of existing DD 254 conditions the term "need to know" encompasses participation under this competition. The proposal must encompass and be compliant with stated requirements. Open teaming between offerors and the incumbent OEMs is encouraged; see FAR 3.301 (Reports of Suspected Antitrust Violations).<br /><br />Industry is reminded that interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when additional information, additional solicitation documentation, and any/or amendments or future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading. MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation documents or any amendments. It is the interested offerors' responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.<br /><br />Release of this RFP is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government is NOT responsible for any costs incurred as a result of this release.<br /><br />The offeror's Volume 4 (Past Performance) proposal is due to this office no later than January 21, 2011 by 3:00 pm (Central Time) and the remaining offeror proposal volumes are due to this office no later than January 28, 2011, by 3:00 pm (Central Time).

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Infrastructure/Geophysical Division (DHS S&amp;T IGD) seeks technologies to improve and increase the nation's preparedness for and response to natural and man-made threats through superior situational awareness, emergency response capabilities, and critical infrastructure protection. The focus of&nbsp;BAA 10-11 is the Real-Time Analysis Communication Environment (RACE), which is in the area of modeling and simulation, and meets the expressed high-priority technologies for the Complex Event Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (CEMSA) system for integration into the Risk Development and Modeling Branch (RDMB) capability portfolio of existing modeling and simulations systems. RDMB managers the in-depth Critical Infrastructures and Key Resources (CIKR) analysis leveraging advanced modeling and simulation and capability development mandated by Congress.&nbsp;The work completed under this BAA will enhance the&nbsp;Congressionally&nbsp;mandated National and Regional analysis, modeling, and simulation capability of analyzing disruptions on CIKR within the time constraints of rapid decision cycles. <br /><br />In order to rapidly achieve an analysis capability to address disruptions to CIKR systems and estimate impact at the local, regional and national levels, RACE will leverage the current Risk Development and Modeling Branch portfolio of analysis, modeling,&nbsp;and simulation tools. The result will be a set of tools complementing CEMSA and being interoperable across the suite of RDMB models and visualization systems which will operate within the Hierarchical Yet Dynamic Reprogrammable Architecture Critical Infrastructure Risk Decision Analysis System environment.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAIABLE AT THIS TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO AND WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM POTENTIAL SOURCES AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.<br /><br />The 49th Contracting Squadron, Holloman AFB, New Mexico is seeking the interest of potential and eligible SMALL BUSINESS contractors for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC). This is a Sources Sought announcement; a market survey for written information only. This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing work which includes all materials, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, supervision, management and other services (including engineering/technical design support) necessary to accomplish non-complex minor construction, maintenance, repair and renovation work on real property with possible design requirements at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico federal installation.
<p>The 49th Contracting Squadron is seeking those firms with a demonstrated history of relevant construction experience where the primary focus is on IDIQ-type contracts with simultaneous performance of multiple projects at differing locations similar to the delivery order value that will be executed under this contract. Every delivery order will be competed. Delivery orders will be firm-fixed price with an estimated targeting award range of $50K to $3.5M. The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is $85M. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes: Sector 23 Construction, Subsector 236 Construction of Buildings, Size Standard $33.5M; Subsector 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, Size Standard $33.5M (except Land Subdivision, $7M and Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities, $20M); and Subsector 238 Specialty Trade Contractors, Size Standard $14M. The description of work will be identified in each individual delivery order. The number of awards the Government will award is still under consideration, however at this point the Government anticipates awarding four (4) contracts. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period with four 12-month option periods. Performance and payment bonds will be required per individual delivery order in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 28.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the FedBizOpps website for program documents. Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must (1) state whether they are small or large business based on the size standard above; if applicable, identify subcontractors to be used and their anticipated responsibilities; (2) indicate all of the following small business status categories that apply: Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 8(a) firm, HUB Zone firm, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Black College and University or Minority Institution (HBVU/MI); (3) provide experience in the form of an outline of previous projects for specific relevant work completed or currently being performed of equivalent magnitude including contract numbers, description of work, points of contact, and phone numbers; professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel identified to perform the work; and (4) provide any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess the capabilities of a firm. Because the Government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a) firms, HUB Zone firms or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business based on the responses it receives, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information for capabilities to be accurately evaluated. Potential offerors should limit their responses to&nbsp;five (5) pages (single spaced, 12 pt font). All information included in offeror responses should be specific to this Sources Sought synopsis.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought announcement are due NLT 14 December 2010 by 4:00 PM. Late responses will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The package shall be sent by mail to: 49th Contracting Squadron (Attn: Theresa A. Sandoval), 490 First Street, Suite 2160, Bldg 29, Holloman AFB, NM 88330-8225. Electronic submissions will not be accepted. All questions regarding this notice can be addressed to: Theresa A. Sandoval at theresa.sandoval@holloman .af.mil, or John T.

<DESC><p>The 30th Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for 8a contractors in the State of California only under the NAICS code 238160 in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Multiple Award Roofing Contract (MARC) program at Vandenberg AFB, CA. No solicitation is being issued at this time.

<p>The government is seeking to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential businesses capable of performing the type of work as described herein. The envisioned MARC program would consist of multiple, firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a Vandenberg AFB Roofing contract.

Delivery Orders written against the MARC program are anticipated to be a minimum of $2,000 per order.</p>

The contractor shall be required to maintain a management office near Vandenberg AFB, CA at their own expense in order to receive work requests and to provide other management services related to accomplishing individual jobs.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation<br />for<br />Deepening of the Port Jersey Channel<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to award a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to perform dredging of the Port Jersey Channel, in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process. The solicitation number for this project is W912DS-11-R-0001.<br /><br />The New York Harbor and Adjacent Channels, Port Jersey Channel, Contract No. 4 (PJ-4) Project consists of deepening of the Port Jersey Channel to El. -50-ft MLW along the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners (PVSC) Outfall Tunnel corridor. The PVSC Outfall Tunnel begins at the PVSC Treatment Plant (Plant) in Newark, NJ and extends in a southeasterly direction beneath the Port Jersey Channel in Bayonne and terminates at the Terminal Chamber (TC) in Upper New York Bay. Within the Port Jersey Channel, the deepening considers the stability of the PVSC 144-inch diameter pipe outfall tunnel and the removal of overburden material during the dredging operations. The dredging operations within the Port Jersey Channel over the PVSC Outfall Tunnel will typically lower the existing mud line of approximately El. 44.5-ft MLW to a final dredging depth of El. -52.0-ft MLW. The design of protective measures for the PVSC Outfall Tunnel includes installing a 5-inch thick steel plate over the Outfall Tunnel in order to protect the tunnel and provide additional overburden weight. The plate is extended a minimum of 15 feet beyond centerline of the Outfall Tunnel for a total length of 30 ft. The top of the plate, after final construction, will be at El. -52.0-ft MWL or below. The non-rock materials suitable for the HARS placement will be placed at the designated HARS site. The non-rock materials unsuitable for the HARS placement will be placed at an Upland Placement Facility and/or at the Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey located at the entrance of Elizabeth Channel. The scope of work also includes the sampling and testing of subsurface materials if needed.<br /><br />It is anticipated that construction would take place within 270 days, including options. The work, including any option/s, is estimated to cost between $30,000,000 and $40,000,000. Plans and Specifications for the subject project would be available on or about 22 October 2010, with Proposals due on 22 November 2010 not later than 2:00 p.m. Send your Proposals to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 1843, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278.<br /><br />The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by the firm of the Notice to Proceed, to prosecute said work diligently, and to complete the work no later than 210 calendar days after the receipt by the firm of the Notice to Proceed. A period of 60 calendar days will be added to the completion date of the basic contract, if options are exercised.<br /><br />This project is being solicited as an Unrestricted procurement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Dredging. The business size standard is $33,500,000. The SIC Code is 1629, which is Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.<br /><br />BASIS FOR AWARD: Procurement will be best value, based on the lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA) proposal.

<DESC>Management Systems Support Division (MSSD), and the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP-M) intend to issue a purchase order for Spatial Analyzer Maintenance for three Naval shipyards Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.

The Government intends to issue an order in pursuant to the provisions of FAR 13.106-1(brand name) Open Market.  This is a sole source, purchase order not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition threshold. This requirement is in accordance to FAR (sub-part) 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency needs.

Spatial Analyzer (SA) is a traceable metrology 3D graphical software platform that can simultaneously communicate to virtually any number and type of dimensional measurement system and perform complex analysis tasks simply.
 SA makes it easier for users to build, inspect and reverse design with any of the portable measurement technologies and allows users to run a job on any measurement technologies.

Spatial Analyzer (SA) is the only software package capable of running any number of the measurement sensors at the same time, therefore saves time by minimizing schedule impacts.

New River Kinematics Inc. is the owner and developer of the software and is the only source to provide maintenance.

 Point of Contact for this acquisition is Mary D. Fasching, Contract Specialist, Email: Mary.Fasching@navy.mil, Naval Inventory Point-Mechanicsburg, 5450 Carlisle Pike, P O Box 2020,Mechanicsburg,PA 17055
