Air conditioning (270 tons) will be provided by a self-contained unit for the Education Center Complex and for the battalion headquarters building by chilled water from the central energy plant.  This project will be procured using the two-phase design-build selection procedure s set forth in FAR 36.3.  In phase one, offerors will receive a request for proposal letter including the project description, submittal requirements, and evaluation factors for both phases.  The evaluation factors for phase one will be offeror past perfor mance, quality of construction, timeliness of performance, documentation, customer satisfaction, subcontractor management, technical approach narrative, offeror relevant experience.  No more than five offerors will be invited to participate in phase two. T he Government anticipates that the phase two documents will be issued on or about March 20, 2002. Award will be made to that offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the Government.  This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of technical and management features with differences in cost to the Government.  In making this comparison, the Government is concerned with striking the most advantageous balance between technical and mana gement features and cost to the Government.  As technical scores and relative advantages and disadvantages become less distinct, differences in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal.  Conversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in scoring and relative advantages and disadvantages between proposals are of increased importance to the determination.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced off er.  The right is also reserved to reject any and all offers.  The basis of award will be a conforming offer; the price or cost of which may or may not be the lowest.  Offerors are reminded to include their best technical and price terms in their initial p roposal and not to automatically assume that they will have an opportunity to participate in discussions or be asked to submit a revised offer.  The Government may make award of a conforming proposal without discussions, if deemed to be within the best int erests of the Government.  Estimated cost range of project is from $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00. Network Analysis System will be required.

<DESC>The Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), through the Program Support Center (PSC) intends to modify Contract Number 213-00-0005 currently being performed by the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).  This contract provides Internet-based Training for the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Field Response Teams of the OEP.  PSC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with UMBC to provide additional Internet-based training for the Disaster Medical Assistance Teams ( DMAT)  Program scheduled to commence March 1, 2002.  This additional training will: (1) utilize a train-the-trainer approach; and (2) encompass approximately 35 topics presented in skill stations conducted during field exercises coordinated by OEP which will be held around the clock over a two to three day period at various locations around the country.  The proposed modification for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the statutory authority for other than full and open competition 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  UMBC is the only known source capable of providing key personnel geographically located within the Baltimore-Washington corridor which is required for meetings with OEP personnel on a frequent and impromptu basis.  UMBC has key personnel familiar with the content of the current DMAT Web-based training program, who will build upon material already developed and have demonstrated experience coordinating field training programs which is critical to meeting the course development timeline. UMBC currently provides continuing education units (CEUs) which are required prior to the pilot train-the trainer courses and which are critical to incentive for recruitment of potential instructors.  Further, UMBC is able to provide the required services by the anticipated start date of March 1, 2002 and can participate in the OEP scheduled field exercises which is necessary for observation and development of the training program.  It is critical to the mission of OEP that training services continue uninterrupted and without loss of functionality.  The closing date is March 3, 2002.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which demonstrates the ability to provide the required services by the specified date.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this modification is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 45 from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with award of the modification to UMBC.  NAICS Code: 611430  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>GSA is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective Januray 2, 2002, electronically only.  The Schedule is entitled "FSC 71, Part II - Household and Quarters Furniture". This new Solicitation, 3FNH-F6-020002-B, entitled as shown above, has been issued to replace standing solicitation 3FNH-F6-990001-B.  Special Item Number (SIN) 71-296 for Leased Furniture and SIN 71-297 for Rental Furniture have been added.  SINs 71-202 Wall Units (wood w/ laminate) and 71-203 Loft Groups, are 100% small business set-aside.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.  Search using Solicitation Number 3FNH-F6-020002-B (include the dashes). 

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! program.  None of the Evergreen options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! website.  All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.  Contracting questions should be directed to the points of contact listed in the solicitation. 

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous.  Individual contract periods will begin on the date of award and will expire five years later (exclusive of any options or cancellations).  All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts with $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate with Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Burns and Associates (GMMBA). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is initiating a multi-state high-visibility law enforcement program to increase seat belt use. This program is similar to the Spring 2001 campaign in the eight states of NHTSA Region IV. GMMBA designed and coordinated the media component of the Region IV campaign. GMMBA is the media coordinator for the Operation ABC National Mobilizations and ensures that the States' paid media campaign is fully coordinated the ABC National Mobilizations. No other public relations firm has the experience with this national mobilization campaign. Congress has directed that Section 157 funds be used for the May 2002 Mobilization. Technical assistance may be required by the States in planning, designing, and implementing public information campaigns as a component of the May 2002 Mobilization. Given the delayed  FY2002 appropriation and Congressional reporting requirements, a tight time frame is associated with implementation of this project. The assistance must be provided by a firm with a thorough familiarity with the messages, timing and target audiences of the Operation ABC National Mobilization and experience with the Region IV high-visibility campaign. The firm should have geographically dispersed field offices to provide support to any State that requests assistance.  Technical assistance will be customized to meet a State's specific request, but may include one or more of the following: identifying target audiences; identifying media markets with a State; developing the advertising plan; projecting a media budget; selecting broadcast stations; developing production plans and scripts; producing ads; and placing ads. 
Interested firms should identify their capability to design, coordinate and conduct the planned campaign as described above. The written response must include detailed information relating to the specific experience and requirements being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of one's ability to accomplish the requested studies will not be considered. Not telephone calls or oral communications will be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals nor is a Request-for-Proposal solicitation document currently available. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursable type contract will be awarded for this effort. The anticipated period of performance is twelve months. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive contract. In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating the required capability, NHTSA intends to request a quotation from the Margolis on a noncompetitive basis for the work described. The listed procuring office must receive responses within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Texas district of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio SBA districts including, participants with bona-fide places of business in either location.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of Blanket Ordering Agreement's (BOA's).  The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).   BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of  (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases, a design concept only, to the contractors for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, an contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order as directed by the Contracting Officer.  The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis.  However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition.   There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000.  A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00 if all parties are in agreement.  The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order issued to the Contractor.  There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

The contractor shall ensure that all work is conducted in an environmentally sound manner and conforms in particular to the applicable regulations promulgated by the Federal Government, State, and local government entities, and in accordance with the Two Party Agreement (TPA) signed between NOAA and the state of Alaska, which mandates that NOAA oversee the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites on St. Paul and St. George Islands. The requirement includes one (1) optional item:  debris disposal and equipment transportation.  NOAA will be responsible for obtaining site access to the Blubber Dump and Polovina Hill.  The contractor shall be responsible for obtaining access to any other areas required to complete this project.

<DESC>NA This solicitation is hereby amended as follows: 1. Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 do not require offerors to input pricing on these attachments.  These attachments are only there to assist offerors understand the requirement/CLINS.  All CLINS for the base and option year must be priced and submitted as p art of the proposal starting on page 2 of 97 through page 35 of 97.   2. Amendment 6, Question 70, the correct response is as follows: Question:  How is a bidder to know what price range the Government is in as it relates to a motivational speaker as they range from $1,000 to a $100,000 plus expenses for a one hour presentation?  Is it the bidders choice? Response:  The price range for the motivational speaker is NTE $20,000.00 3.  The following CLINS are hereby RESERVED.  CLIN 0091 and CLIN 1070 4. The following questions were received from industry prior to 10 Jan 2002 and the responses are as folows:   1. Paragraphs numbered 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 list food and beverage functions that take place during the Conference however, there is no mention within these paragraphs or anyplace else within the RFQ when the Government will provide the guarante e count to the contractor.  Please clarify. Response:  The contractor has to determine the guarantee count from the number of attendees registered for the conference and then confirms the guarantee count by the number of on-site registrations.  Historically, the attendance has been as follows: 	2001-1,601 attendees 	2000-1,792 attendees 	1999-1,739 attendees 2. Is the 72-hour guarantee (for food and beverage) at all hotels and convention centers (excluding weekends) the responsibility of the Contractor or the Government? Response:  The contractor is responsible. 3. A) If it is the Contractor, what protection or guarantees does the Government offer the contractor to make sure the correct food count ordered is accurate and that funds from the Conference Fee controlled by the Government are available to pay for it? Example-The meals ordered were for 1500 attendees because that was the number that was pre-registered yet only 1300 showed up; therefore; the conference fees will not cover the ordered food quantities cost.  B. What basis would the contractor use as a guid e to know how many to order? Response: A. In the past the government has not offered a guarantee.  The Contractor will collect the registration fees to pay for the food. Response:  B. Refer to response from question 3.1 above. 4. A. All hotels and convention centers require that food and beverage guarantees accompany a contract of this nature.  What food and beverage guarantees is the Government offering with this contract?  B.  If an offeror can only offer a proposal with a foo d and beverage guarantee associated with it, is the Government willing to accept it? Response:  A. The government does not provide food and beverage guarantees. Response:  B.  In regards to only offering a proposal with a food and beverage guarantee associated with it, No, a food and beverage guarantee will be considered a condition for acceptance of the proposal.  Therefore, the government may or may not choose t o negotiate or accept the proposal. 5. Paragraph 3.2 states that the contractor shall arrange for lodging accommodations for a list of specific days and quantities however, fails to mention the government guaranteeing this large number of rooms or agreeing to an attrition clause.  It is an i ndustry standard that at the bare minimum, that a group (government) would adhere to an attrition policy, especially for a 10,400 room night contract.  Is this something the Government is willing to do, just neglected to mention? Response:  The government does not provide lodging guarantees. Historically the attendance has been 		2001-1,601 attendees 		2000-1,792 attendees 		1999-1,739 attendees 6. Item 0074 requests a unit price for 30 booths.  But 6.6 states that the COR will not identify who the Exhibition Company will be until 6 months

<DESC>Reference is made to the presolicitation notice posted on Jan 07, 2002.  The list of 450 items posted on the DSCC website, referenced in the Jan 07, 2002 notice, has been updated.  The previous list inadvertently contained some non-automotive items.  The new list contains several of the items posted on the Jan 07, 2002 list.  The new/updated list of 450 items is posted at http://dibbs.dscccols.com/solicitations under the heading "DSCC Corporate Contract/Tailored Support Solicitations".  The previous notice follows this modification. --------




The Defense Supply Center-Columbus is pursuing a 10-year, firm fixed price (FFP) with economic price adjustment (EPA), indefinite quantity (IQ) type contract under the Fleet Automotive Support Initiative (FASI) for the CONUS East and West regions.  The contract will have a two-year base period followed by one two-year option and two three-year options.  The primary goal of the FASI is to improve customer support at the user level through use of the Virtual Prime Vendor (VPV) concept.  The Vendor(s) will be required to support the identified vehicles at military installations within the region.  DSCC has coordinated with the customer to identify specific vehicles or items for which a FASI prime vendor can provide parts support, technical support, fleet requirements forecasting, inventory management, or other enhanced supply services as required by the customer.  The VPV should be capable of providing integrated logistics support for automotive/vehicle parts within a particular region.  The VPV must be capable of achieving a 98% on-demand issue rate, have the ability to forecast the customer's future needs and develop inventories or business relationships to meet such needs.  The VPV must be capable of providing value added anticipatory services such as, technical support, local Customer Service Representatives, and meet surge and sustainment requirements during mobilization.
A lead military installation will be identified as the initial site for each region.  Contract award for the region will be based on the evaluation of Vendors' proposals for the initial site's requirements.  Following contract award, and once the initial site is implemented through a three party agreement (DSCC, military customer and vendor), FASI will rollout to other customers within each of the regions.  Since FASI is intended to have one Prime Vendor/3PL cover an entire region, each of these roll out sites will be added to the contract without re-solicitation.  Sites are intended to encompass any DoD activity, including the Reserves and National Guard.
A "Market Basket" population of 450 items has been identified for the two implementation sites within the East and West regions.  This population will be included in the solicitation.  The list of 450 items will be available on the DSCC website (www.dscc.dla.mil) or (http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp) on or before 11 Jan 02.  Currently, the potential population of items for the East and West regions consists of approximately 11,000 items.

<SUBJECT>B -- Flight Safety Analysis Contract
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: The 30th Space Wing intends to extend the Flight Safety Analysis Contract (FSAC) #F04684-97-C-0001 with ACTA Inc, for a period of six months (1 Apr 02 through 30 Sep 02).
By extending the FSAC, launch critical services, ongoing analyses, and external agency support will be uninterrupted while the new Wing Safety, Performance and Evaluation Contract (WSPEC) is being completed.  The current FSAC provides highly technical flight safety analysis support to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing Safety Office, Flight Analysis (Flight Safety), 30SW/SEY at the Western Range (WR), Vandenberg AFB, CA.  In addition to 30th Space Wing, customers include AF, HQ AFSPC, 14th AF, NASA, FAA, other range support contractors and commercial launch agencies.
The WR encompasses a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean. Flight safety analysis is performed spanning areas of this arena from California and the offshore flight test areas to South America, Antarctica and the Republic of the Marshall Islands in the mid Pacific. Flight safety analysis requires the application of complex scientific methods and a thorough technical understanding of range safety policies. The objective of this extension is to maintain uninterrupted, responsive, and technically excellent flight safety providing public protection and support for ballistic, space, aeronautical, directed energy (lasers) and related programs.  Long term effort with follow-on tasking over many years has been required to devise, demonstrate and refine the sophisticated flight safety assessment tools used to address risks from debris, overpressure and toxic gasses associated with current and evolving vehicle flight and launch operations.  Tasking includes multiyear efforts to coordinate flight safety analysis processes and tools across federal agencies and with commercial launch vehicle operators and to revise governing documents and standards.  The lead times, launch preparation, knowledge base, skill sets and budget cycles for these vehicles and systems span several years.
The government considers one year the minimum time needed to conduct thorough analytic studies and use time, personnel and funding efficiently, considering database revisions, the knowledge base, conferencing, documentation and approval cycles.  A six months extension to the current contract will achieve this optimum one-year time span.

Phase-in would require a minimum of two months due to the launch schedule, criticality of the public protection and timing of product delivery.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, development of procedures and obtaining required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of FSAC services or impact to launch schedules.

Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Evelyn Swain within 15 days of this publication.

<SUBJECT>R -- Rural Power of Poverty Reduction (RPPR) Program in Bangladesh
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Bangladesh intends to award a five-year contract to National Rural Electric Cooperative Authority (NRECA) to implement the final stage of the Rural Power for Poverty Reduction Program (RPPR-II) in Bangladesh. The authority for this non-competitive procurement is AID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) 706.302-70, Impairment of Foreign Aid Programs. A justification and approval for other than full and open competition has been prepared based on AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5); the award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in unacceptable delays to the program. The primary purpose for extending further support to the Bangladesh Rural Electrification program is to ensure the sustainability of the rural electrification effort through a well-planned program phase-out. USAID believes NRECA is uniquely situated for this award given that they are currently mobilized in the field with staff and monitoring systems already in place, the existing program was created based on a model developed by NRECA, and NRECA has established a collaborative working relationship with the Government of Bangladesh's Rural Electrification Board (REB) and the Rural Electric Cooperatives (PBSs) that would take several years to replicate. NRECAs long-term association with the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Program has promoted the development of a strong working relationship between NRECA, the REB and the vast network of PBSs. Since this program is closely patterned after NRECAs U.S. Program, REB/PBSs have strong confidence that NRECA understands their organization and the challenges they face. The trust and congenial relationships that have been established between NRECA and the Bangladesh partners are invaluable in terms of accomplishing our Rural Electrification objectives. Placing a new contractor in the field at this stage, no matter how qualified, would be disruptive and not understood by Bangladeshis, particularly when this is the final stage of the program. It is, therefore, the opinion of USAID that mobilization of a new contract team would undermine the successful phase out of USAID's assistance to the Rural Electrification program. Qualified companies may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, submissions received before January 31, 2002 will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS:  541690, COMPETITION LEVEL:  Sole Source, and Order of Magnitude (Threshold):  Estimated $5 million.
