<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) has the responsibility to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth and young adults in the United States. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) was developed to handle this requirement. The YRBSS monitors six behavioral categories: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injury and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection; 5) dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. The YRBSS also monitors obesity and asthma in addition to theses six behaviors. The YRBSS consists of biennial national, state, territorial, and local school-based surveys of representative samples of 9th through 12th students. All school-based surveys are conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. The school-based surveys are conducted by state, local, and territorial education and health agencies as part of a cooperative agreement (CDC-RFA-DP08-801) with DASH. 

The School Health Profiles (Profiles) was developed to assess the status of school health policies and programs among secondary schools in states, territories, and cities. Profiles monitors school health policies and programs related to school health education; school health policies related to HIV infection/AIDS, tobacco use, unintentional injuries and violence, physical activity, and nutrition; physical education; asthma management activities; and family and community involvement in school health programs. 

CDC intends to award a contract to provide technical assistance to as many as 51 states (includes the District of Columbia), approximately 25 large cities, 17 Steps communities, and 7 U.S. territories to implement that state and local school-based YRBS among 9th through 12th grade high school students. In addition, the contractor shall provide technical assistance to as many as 40 agencies to help conduct surveys among middle school students and special populations of students. Technical assistance for each site includes, but not limited to updating, enhancing, and maintaining a password-protected website for technical assistance; assisting with the revision of the YRBS questionnaire; selecting a sample using accepted statistical methods and properly documenting the methods used; preparing data sets; developing and implementing a weighting plan; disseminating technical assistance materials; and preparing reports. 

Award of a cost plus fixed fee contract in is contemplated. The period of performance will be 60-months, with five (5) incrementally funded phases.

<RESPDATE>011508
<ARCHDATE>06262008
<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Darren Shaffer, Contracting Officer, 617-494-2332
<DESC>The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, a contract with the Harvard Medical School (HMS), Division of Sleep Medicine (DSM).  The contract will require the contractor to develop a multi-media web-based education program to provide Class 1, 2, and 3 railroad employees with a scientifically valid way to assess personal risk for prevalent sleep disorders as potentially related to the shiftwork schedules of railroad industry employees, and educational resources and accessible information regarding sleep science, sleep health, fatigue and fatigue management. This program shall be developed from currently available web-based applications, specifically, a proven screening tool for sleep disorders in shiftworkers. The goal is to produce a web-based educational program that draws in the target user, and provides him/her with easy-to-understand, scientifically credible information. This program requires the incorporation of an existing web-based sleep disorders screening tool for shiftworkers, which can be adapted to provide a rail context. The screening tool must (1) be web-based; (2) screen for multiple sleep disorders: insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and restless leg syndrome (RLS), in addition to narcolepsy with cataplexy and shift work sleep disorder (SWSD), and restless leg syndrome (RLS); (3) be validated as demonstrated by previous, successful development and implementation in another shiftworker population, in order to ensure that it is appropriate for adaptation to shiftworking railroad employees. Proof of validation must exist in the form of published, scientific study findings regarding data obtained through administering the screening tool, and be presented in one or more peer-reviewed, scientific journals; and (4) the data collected using the sleep disorders screening tool must be maintained and utilize appropriate safeguards of personal and sensitive information as provided over the web in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and other such standards. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611710 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested firms must submit, to the above named point of contact, a maximum of three, but not less than two pages addressing their capabilities, and providing clear and convincing evidence of the firm?s capability to meet the screening tool?s required criteria identified above.  Written capability statements must be submitted to be received no later than 4:30 pm E.S.T January 15, 2008.  This proposed action is for research and development for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority in FAR 6.302-1.  All responses to this Notice, including Statements of Capabilities, must be in writing, and may be transmitted by either postal or electronic mail. All responses must be sent to Darren Shaffer, Contract Specialist, United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142-1093.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692,  Fax:  (202) 475-3904

The period of performance for this procurement will be from February 17, 2008 through February, 2009.  NO SOLICITATION OR  REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

5TI5708001RFP

1. It is our understanding that TS/SCI is granted as "need to know" with "reading in and out" of the target program.  Consequently it is anticipated that the SCI would be granted and removed on an as-needed basis with the TS putting our personnel in position for immediate SCI clearance.
    *  Is this intrepretation correct?
    *  In that case is the TS sufficient to be considered for this work?

ANSWER: Must have TOP SECRET/SCI clearance at the time of proposal submission 

2.  The contract size was unclear to us but the annual $100k travel budget
    seemed to indicate a moderate size.  As a small vetern-owned firm we
    would be interested in teaming with larger entities to pursue this work.
    *  Can one obtain information on the vending teams that are pursuing the
       work?
    *  Who was the incumbent for the work and what was their period of
       performance?

ANSWER:  Unable to answer the first part about vending teams.  Your company will have to pursue that avenue.  One the second part, MacAuley-Brown and Computer Services Corp.

3.   Section L.13.6 states that ?The offeror shall complete past performance questionnaire, in Section J, for each client reference.?  Section J does not contain a questionnaire and has been left blank.  Please provide a copy of the past performance questionnaire that is to be completed.

ANSWER:  Please provide contact information as requested in the solicitation.  The Government will send out the questionnaires. 
 
4.  Are the hours specified in Section B.4 "annual hours", that is, hours to estimate for each period - the base period and the four one-year option periods?

ANSWER:  YES
 
5.  Should the ?Total Hours? specified in Section B.4 for the ?Engineer/Analyst L-1 50%? be 990 (119 + 871), rather than 882?
 
ANSWER:  YES,  PLEASE CORRECT HOURS TO 990 VS 882.

6.  In Section B.4, by listing the labor category of ?Engineering L-3? three times, are you indicating that three full-time equivalents (FTE) are required?
 
ANSWER:  YES

7.   Section I, page I-39, Clauses No. I.2.42, I.2.43, and I.2.45 regarding the Service Contract Act.  Since the majority of the Statement of Work is for professional services, we request that the SCA clauses be deleted.

ANSWER:  Clause has language that applies to this task.  It will not be deleted.
 
8.   For proposal consistency purposes, what is the anticipated start date for the base period?

ANSWER:  On or about 1 February 2008

Indal is the only known designer, developer, and manufacturer of the HRS that has the knowledge, experience, and technical data required to fulfill the requirements within the scheduled delivery time period.  The Government intends to procure this item under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

This presolicitation Request For Quotations (RFQ) replaces prior solicitation #PRN6260408BADGE. The United States Navy requires tailoring of utility uniforms to support the Navy personnel processed for expeditionary missions for mobilization and individual augmentee assignments. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Uniform insignias and embroidery will be mounted in accordance with NAVPERS 156651. The uniforms issued to each individual consist of four blousers, four trousers and two covers. All quotes should be based on an estimated 6,250 uniforms and 3,125 covers per year. The anticipated period of performance consists of a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods. The proposed contract will be a firm fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery ? Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with delivery order provisions. The exercise of option years remains the Government?s unilateral right. Necessary tailoring services shall be as described in the Statement of Work (SOW). 

Offerors are required to submit past performance information, to include contract number, description of product or service, customer point of contact information, period of performance and value. Information shall be provided for past performance contracts/experiences within the past three years. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice / Procurement  # M08PS00006 Continuation of Impact Assessment of Subsistence Whaling Activities Associated with Oil Production Near the Beaufort Sea, Alaska The Department of Interior (DOI), Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement for - Continuation of Impact Assessment of Subsistence Whaling Activities Near Cross Island Associated with Oil Production Near the Beaufort Sea.-  This requirement is being issued as full and open in accordance with FAR Part 15 for competitive acquisitions.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this announcement.  In order to compete under this acquisition, interested parties must demonstrate they are capable of performing the work by providing a Capabilities Statement.  Instructions regarding submission of capabilities statements are contained herein.  Following review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements received from this announcement, a list of those deemed best qualified to perform the work will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal and any other logistical considerations.  Based on the review of the capability statements received in response to this announcement, the MMS reserves the right to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the list of those deemed best qualified.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition, based on the review of the responses to this announcement and in accordance with FAR 15.202.  The Government anticipates to competitively award a cost reimbursement-type contract for the effort described below.  The anticipated period of performance shall be not more than 5 years from the effective date of the contract.    PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:  The purpose of this study is to continue the monitoring of impacts to subsistence whaling activities in the vicinity of Cross Island that may be associated with production of oil from the Northstar Unit in the near-shore Beaufort Sea, and maintenance of relevant baseline and trend data collection of whale hunting activities as they relate to new offshore development projects in the Cross Island area, such as Liberty and Oooguruk.  This study will gather long-term monitoring data to help the MMS assess whether OCS oil development activities at Northstar and/or Liberty result in changes to bowhead whale subsistence hunting practices, or to hunting success at Cross Island. The first research question is whether Cross Island subsistence whaling displays significant variation over time. The second question is whether such variation can be attributed to offshore oil and gas industrial activities. This goal will be accomplished through the following activities: (1) project management, (2) community engagement, (3) data collection of subsistence bowhead whaling near Cross Island started by ANIMIDA Task Order 4, (4) data analysis to identify and interpret notable changes in whaling activities over time, (5) submission of recorded field data in an annual report for each year 2008-2012, (6) submission of a Final Summary Narrative comparing and summarizing in analytic narrative the significant results from this study (2008-2012) with the 2001-2007 annual reports from the ANIMIDA and cANIMIDA projects, (7) and presentation of major findings in oral and written format to interested stakeholder groups. SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations must submit a Capability Statement to the Contracting Officer of no more than 20 pages (on 8/5 x 11 inch size paper, single sided print in MS Word, with a font of 10 points or higher), that details the ability to perform the effort described above.  Any pages in excess of 20 will not be evaluated.  Emphasis should be placed on the organization's familiarity and understanding of the Beaufort Sea and subsistence whaling activities.  Offerors should describe their experience in the type of work proposed, demonstrated ability to do the work, and an understanding of the directed missions of the MMS, as well as the company's prior experience in work of similar scope and complexity to this project, qualifications of the organization's key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the tasks), and timely delivery of final products. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Provide three references of similar contracts performed by either your proposed key personnel and/or your organization for the last two years.  Include a description of the project, project title, contract number, period of performance, client identification which includes agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address, and telephone number.  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.   EVALUTION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  Your capability statement will be evaluated based on the following factors, which are of equal importance:  (1) the understanding of effort and objectives, (2) demonstrated experience and expertise of key technical personnel, (3) degree of experience from past projects to the current project.   RESPONSES DUE DATE:  Capability statements are due no later than 12:00 Noon, E.T., on Wednesday, January 16, 2008.  Please submit your response electronically to caroline.laikin@mms.gov or submit three (3) paper copies of your response to the attention of Caroline Laikin, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, MS 2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Minerals Management Service (MMS), has a competitive requirement for ?Conference Management and Reports on MMS Results,? which would support MMS? Environmental Studies Information Transfer Meetings (ITM) and Workshops for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued.  The Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to competitively award one IDIQ contract for this effort, and anticipates firm fixed price and time and materials task orders issued against an IDIQ, with a base year and two twelve month option years (performance period no longer than 36 months from date of award).  The estimated cost range over the three years is estimated to be between $175,000 - $200,000.  INTRODUCTION: A considerable amount of data and information has been and continues to be gathered in the course of research conducted for the MMS Environmental Studies Program. In addition, other agencies, academia, and industry consultants have collected and continue to collect environmental data in the OCS Regions as well. To improve the accessibility, use and exchange of this information, the MMS Alaska Regional Office conducts public meetings with a variety of formats. The meetings are of 3-day duration. Workshops may be of shorter duration, and focus on a single discipline or topic. The general format of the two types of meetings is essentially the same. The differences are in the duration of the meetings and the breadth of topical coverage. The meetings and workshops shall be documented in proceedings.  The meetings shall be open to the public. Also, the contractor shall provide for pre-meeting plans, advertising, letters of invitation, procurement of meeting facilities, meeting logistics and staffing, and post-meeting reports as indicated below.  The Government is not obligated to order beyond a Guaranteed Minimum amount which will be stipulated in the contract. The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described.  The MMS will describe specific services and tasks in separate task orders that the contracting office will issue for each meeting or workshop against the resultant IDIQ.  Pre-Meeting Planning: a) Meeting Location and Facilities. The MMS will determine when the meetings will take place and the city where each meeting will be held. Meetings and workshops will be held in Anchorage, AK, unless otherwise specified.  For estimating purposes, the projected attendance is 80 to 200 for ITMs, and 20 to 100 for each workshop. For a particular location, the contractor shall investigate and evaluate suitable meeting site facilities for MMS's approval following the guidelines described below. The audience and invited speakers shall consider meeting site facilities for their accessibility. The expected audience will consist of Federal, state and local government personnel, industry representatives, individuals and scientists from academia, and the general public. If possible, the meeting facilities should be in close proximity (within walking distance) to shops, tourist facilities, restaurants, etc. The facilities shall have adequate space for meeting sessions, workshops, and coffee breaks. At a minimum, the necessary accommodation shall be a main meeting room to seat the maximum estimated attendance previously provided, and at least two additional breakout rooms to accommodate 40 to 75 people. The contractor shall provide all equipment which may be necessary. The contractor shall also reserve a sufficient number of hotel or motel rooms in or as near as possible to the meeting facilities for invited out-of-the-area speakers at the meeting. b) Advertising: The advertising shall consist of direct mailings (MMS will provide addressed mailing labels ~1,000 labels), notices to scientific and technical and personal contacts. The contractor shall initiate advertising at least six (6) months prior to each meeting. There shall be three direct mailings, personal contacts, and notices in three technical/scientific journals or local newspapers if requested by MMS. c) Agenda, Meeting Format, and Presenter's Guidelines. The contractor shall prepare a draft agenda.  Some presentations will be oriented to a technical audience and some to the layman. d) Letters of Invitation and Submission of Papers: The contractor shall contact and invite speakers from the MMS compiled speaker list.  e) Travel Arrangements for Speakers. For an ITM, the contractor shall provide transportation to and from the meeting for up to three days for approximately 12 invited speakers traveling from locations outside of Anchorage, as applicable. The Contractor shall make travel arrangements for these speakers. The contractor shall pay honoraria for non-government speakers. Responsibilities During the Meeting: The contractor shall be responsible for the logistics of the meeting during the meeting period. The contractor shall be specifically responsible for insuring that all equipment necessary is available and functioning, providing a liaison between the facilities staff and MMS at each meeting room, staffing a registration table and coordinating any handouts at the table. The contractor shall provide a person for each session to take notes on the talks and discussions through the meeting. This person should be familiar with the discipline of the particular talk or topic.   The MMS will provide staff members in appropriate disciplines to act as conveners for the meeting and individual meeting sessions. Post Meeting responsibilities:   a) Proceedings Report. The contractor shall provide a meeting proceedings report in a form and number defined in the respective task order. The report shall include the papers presented, a list of attendees and participants including addresses and telephone numbers, and short summaries of the discussions sessions, as appropriate. b) Payment of Expenses:  The contractor shall make payment of all allowable expenses incurred including meeting rooms, audiovisual equipment, honoraria and travel for speakers.  4. Project Coordination. Project Coordinator: The Project Coordinator will be the primary contact with MMS.  The Project Coordinator shall have demonstrated abilities to organize, prepare for, and run a scientific meeting in Alaska.  b) Support Staff:  The contractor shall assign sufficient staff to prepare for and run a scientific meeting.   These functions include, but are not limited to, managing correspondence, preparing and monitoring organizational agendas, technical note taking, meeting registration, etc. Note takers shall have a technical background in the discipline (i.e. physical oceanography, habitat and ecology, marine mammals, etc.) on which they are taking notes. HOW TO RESPOND:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your name, organization?s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address by close of business Tuesday, January 22, 2008, to the attention of Debra Bridge, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170, or email this same information to debra.bridge@mms.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force requests industry-wide assistance in identifying potential concepts/solutions for the Air Force's full spectrum of military combat support capabilities.  The Agile Combat Support Modernization Analysis Working Group (MAWG) is interested in obtaining information from industry, academia, and National Laboratories for concepts/solutions, as well as enabling and critical R&D innovative technologies and approaches, which potentially enhance Air Force ability to achieve combat support across a full spectrum of military operations.  The MAWG is preparing to conduct a Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) for FY-10 POM input.  Agile Combat Support is comprised of equipment and systems that are applied in support of all Air Force military operations.  There is an immediate need to safely and efficiently operate, survive, and sustain operations in all Combat Support scenarios with lighter weight, smaller footprint, reduced number of combat support resources to achieve a more rapidly deployable capability.  These mandates require the more efficient application of combat support resources, equipment, and concepts, via enabling technologies to support a broad spectrum of combat support capabilities.  Agile Combat Support concept of operations identifies 27 functional areas in support of Expeditionary Combat Support operations.  This RFI is limited to the following functional areas: Aeromedical Evacuation, Air Traffic Control and Airfield Management, Chaplain, Civil Engineer, Communications and Information, Contracting, Financial Management and Comptroller, Historian, Intelligence, Judge Advocate, Logistics Planning, Maintenance and Munitions, Manpower, Medical, Military Equal Opportunity, Personnel, Postal Services, Protocol, Public Affairs, Safety, Security Forces, Base Services, Supply, and Transportation.  To be considered a viable concept, submissions must apply to one or more Agile Combat Support capabilities.  A capability list of requested topics is provided in a subsequent Amendment under the same tracking number as this special notice.  Many combat support conditions across the full spectrum of military operations restrict operational prerogatives.  Initial forces often arrive with minimal support and resources.  Equipment and systems may be constrained by limited airlift or sealift.  Pre-positioned assets in areas of operations may be constrained by international agreements or lack of agreements.  Bed-down plans, transportation, and manpower may be constrained by short-notice response times, budget shortfalls, or force reductions.  Innovative, concepts potentially serve to offset these constraints.  Operating locations may be required to support other military branches and/or allied military forces.  Information on systems, tactics, and techniques that require less inter theater airlift and fewer personnel to support, erect, and maintain operations are requested.  Present combat support resources are aging and are quickly becoming technically obsolete.  Viable concepts/solutions shall include those that are projected to mature within the following timeframes: Near-term- (2010-2015), Mid-term- (2016-2025), Far-term- (2026-2035).  All viable concepts will be entered under the ongoing FSA.  The operational benefits of reducing personnel requirements and logistical footprint are of particular interest and cannot be over stated in this request.  Concept data should provide sufficient detail regarding processes, technologies, approaches and capabilities for the Government to meaningfully assess the concept's viability, risk, scope of development and procurement costs as well as correlation to the Agile Combat Support capability topics listed under amendment one.  Submission of concepts under this special notice will require the use of a Concept Template provided separately in an amendment to this Special Notice using the same tracking number.  Each concept/solution shall specify sufficient detail, not to exceed 3 pages, in describing potential viability.  The template format shall be followed in order for a concept submission to be considered responsive.  Each response must be received at the: 688th Armament Systems Squadron, 314 Choctawhatchee Avenue, Suite 104, Bldg. 40, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5717, no later than close of business 28 January 2008 in order for it to be considered.  Data submissions must be delivered via Email (using the MS Word template file provided), or a PDF Formatted attachment, or via authorized delivery means for documents authorized under DOD procedures.  Mark all proprietary information "For Government Use Only."  MAWG government representatives from across the entire US Air Force will technically score all responsive concept submissions.  This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the US Government.  Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer which could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award any contract on the sole basis of this special notice, nor shall the US Government otherwise pay for any information solicited under this special notice.  For additional information on requested technologies or concepts, please contact Lyle Crews, USAF civilian employee at (850) 883-3504.

<DESC>(3) Description of Supplies/Services. -  The Coast Guard Yard is tasked with the major overhaul of the 110?, 210? and 270? patrol boats for the MEP program currently underway at the U.S. Coast Guard Shipyard. The components are marine painting systems (primer, paint, thinner, hardener and epoxy) which are required by the work specifications of the boats.  The total estimated cost of this purchase is approximately $156K. 
         4)   This justification and approval is based upon the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304?(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, HSAM 3006.302-1 and CGAP 3006.302-190, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  This purchase is being made as a brand name purchase as it is the only marine paint that has been found that has performed in a satisfactory manner without failure.
        (5)   Unique Qualifications of the AMERON Paint System  -  The AMERON paint systems are the only paint systems used by the Yard on the 110', 210' and 270' vessels which have been delivered and been proven to stand up under the harsh conditions and the sea water environment of the 110's, 210's and 270's.   The premature failure of the paint systems will require the ship to be re-dry-docked prematurely to avoid the hull rusting from lack of paint protection.  The premature dry-docking will cause financial harm to the Coast Guard starting in the tens of thousands of dollars per day, not including the disruption to the dry-dock schedule at the Coast Guard Yard.  The painting systems and components are required on an ASAP basis to allow the painters time to install the painting systems, allow the paint to properly cure, and to allow for the re-blasting and touch up of problem areas where non-adherence is occurring due to improper surface preparation and the last minute discovery of problematic hull plate.  This paint is applied in difficult conditions of temperature, humidity and inclement weather.  It is the only paint that has been used without premature failure.
    (6)     This requirement will be synopsized on FEDBIZOPS.  The Coast Guard Yard has searched for other paint sources which can withstand the harsh marine conditions of the Coast Guard's fleets of 110's, 210's and 270's.  At least two other paint sources have been tried.  The paints have prematurely peeled, blistered and spider-webbed.  These conditions are unacceptable on military vessels   performing essential missions.  This requirement will be solicited on the internet as a solicitation synopsis.  Sources of marine paint will be invited to present their qualifications for review.

(7)	The contractor will undergo negotiations which will include price analysis.  The price of similar paint systems will be compared to the price proposed for the AMERON paint systems.  The contracting officer will not make award unless the price can be determined fair and reasonable.     
(8)	The technical representative from 03 will search the internet for marine paints on an intermittent basis.  He already has performed an internet search for marine paint suppliers prior to the submission of this requirement.  
(9)	The acquisition is being conducted on a sole source basis because previous alternatives have proven unsatisfactory for the reasons described above.  The ability to purchase a technical data package or writing a detailed specification is not satisfactory from a technical perspective.  Only a proven marine paint system is an acceptable competitor to the present AMERON paint system.
(10)	No sources that can supply a marine paint system have been found.
(11)	There will be continuing searches for acceptable suppliers of marine paint systems on the internet and using FEDBIZOPS.
(12)	Certifications and Approval  
Technical Requirements Certification As Required By FAR 6.303.1(b).
I certify that the facts and representation under my cognizance which are included in this justification

<SUBJECT>A--SIMPLIFYING NASA ANNOUNCEMENTS OF OPPORTUNITY
<DESC>Dear Colleague: Alan Stern, Associate Administrator for Science Mission Directorate (SMD), has initiated an effort to simplify NASA Announcements of Opportunity (AOs). AOs are issued by NASA to solicit proposals for complete PI-led missions (like Explorer, Discovery, Mars Scout, etc.), for smaller PI-led missions of opportunity, and for instruments for NASA?s strategic missions (like recent AOs for RBSP, MMS, MSL, JWST, etc.). This AO simplification effort is being led by Paul Hertz, Senior Advisor in SMD at NASA Headquarters responsible for the AO process, and Brad Perry, Head of the Science Support Office at NASA Langley research center and responsible for the technical/ management/ cost (TMC) review process. There are at least three necessary outcomes that are required from an AO, and any simplified AO must still enable those outcomes. (1) Maintain the ability for NASA to evaluate the science merit (through science peer review) to guide selection. (2) Maintain the ability for NASA to evaluate the feasibility of proposed missions (through TMC review) to guide selection.  (3) Ensure that mission teams are ready to successfully conduct Phase A mission concept studies if they are selected. The first step of this effort is to gather information. NASA is conducting information gathering sessions at community meetings as well as soliciting input directly from the community. We held a successful community meeting at the Division of Planetary Science (DPS) meeting in Orlando last October. The next community meeting will be a splinter session at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) winter meeting in Austin, Texas. The AO simplification session is Thursday, January 10 during the lunch break. Please check the final AAS schedule for the exact time and room. Whether or not you can join us for the community meeting, please send us any comments or input that you have for this study. We are looking for all kinds of input: suggestions about AOs, suggestions about the 2-step selection process (the AO rules and the downselect are closely coupled), even suggestions about how to carry out this study. We are especially looking for suggestions of AO changes that will reduce the amount of work on the proposer without impacting the quality of the competition (what some proposers call ?non value added AO requirements?). Please send responses to aosimplify@nasa.gov. Paul Hertz, NASA HQ, paul.hertz@nasa.gov Brad Perry, NASA LaRC, raleigh.b.perry@nasa.gov

<SUBJECT>--Market and Literature Investigation and Research of Printed Electronics
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 3, the U.S. Army RDECOM, Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, intends to award a sole source contract to Research Triangle Institute, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27709- 2194 to provide Market and Literature Investigation and Research of Printed Electronics.  <BR><BR><BR>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  It is not a solicitation or a request for offers.  Information received will be conside red solely for the purpose of competitive procurement in the future.  Interested Parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail. No solic itation package is available. The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract.  The North American Industry Classification System for this procurement is 541690. Responses must be received no later than January 23, 2008 at 5:00 PM.  Questio ns concerning this synopsis may be directed to Thomas F. Roan  Jr , Contract Specialist , at   thomas.roan@natick.army.mil  or 508-233-6263 .  <BR>Statement of Work<BR><BR><BR>	The Contractor shall investigate the commercial market to identify and document  the latest technology advances and anticipated developments associated with low cost, ultra low power, single-use printed electronic components and devices, and the process and viability of incorporating such printed electronics into packaging materials.  The purpose of the market investigation is to explore the commercial markets capability to ultimately produce packaging systems incorporating printed electronics to provide an automated real-time or on-demand visual display of ration status, to include a  shelf-life assessment based on environmental history.  <BR><BR>	The concept envisioned is a printed electronic circuit platform with multiple sensors and a display that is printed on a flexible substrate (e.g., in the form of a label or device), which is then integrated or applied to plastic films for pallet loads and/or cases of rations such as the Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) or Unitized Group Ration (UGR).  Based on input and data from printed environmental, temperature and other sensors, this all in one ce ntral circuit could provide a real-time electronic display of remaining ration shelf life (the key feature), package integrity and tampering, and/or food quality and safety.  <BR><BR>	The Contractor shall focus the investigation on domestic products.  Howe ver, foreign technology may also be identified if there is a high potential for a U.S. manufacturer or distributor.  <BR><BR>	 The Contractor shall research the printed electronics field to identify industry leaders and key players, including companies dev eloping and printing electronic components and those integrating such components into printed circuits; their anticipated technology developments; industry forecasts; potential vendors for fabricating the system based on technology maturity level and appli cability to ration packaging; and the availability, capability, and producibility of the printed electronic circuit.  Key issues include component and circuit design, printing, prototype fabrication, and sensor, circuit, and packaging integration.  The Con tractor shall document the producibility of the system, potential technical challenges, and the estimated costs to produce the system.<BR><BR>Specifically, the research shall include the following:<BR><BR>a)  Conduct a review of the literature and industry  related to printed electronics to identify potential US and foreign technical capabilities and manufacturers of candidate commercial components and systems.  Review the state-of-the-art and emerging innovations in printed electronic technologies to determ ine their adaptability and market readiness to provide the printed components for the above application.  Describe the suitability of these electronic component s for military use in the field to include durability under a range of environmental conditions and proper disposal and recycling requirements.  These circuit components will typically include the power (battery), antenna, a thin-film display, sensor eleme nts (time/temperature), circuitry, switches, and/or microprocessor.  Determine which electronic components can currently be printed and which are still in development or cannot be printed.<BR><BR>b) Study the processing and integration technologies availab le off-the-shelf to mass produce the printed electronic circuitry and other components envisioned for the design. Identify the most likely technologies that allow the smart design to be incorporated into flexible plastics packaging.  <BR><BR>c) Identify va rious commercial sources for implementing the smart packaging material based on above findings.  Identify several key commercial sources for design of system and for manufacturing the printed packaging material(s). <BR><BR>d) Describe any potential technic al, logistical, and/or operational barriers for implementation of this technology into ration packaging, provide potential technologies and/or methods to overcome such barriers, and estimate the costs to overcome the obstacles. <BR><BR>e)  Identify and des cribe:  <BR>o	The number of steps and number of different parties it will take to develop the complete system.<BR>o	The complexity or difficulty of the research and development steps.<BR>o	Integration issues.<BR>o	Interfaces for connecting the printed sens ors to the algorithm. <BR>o	Optimal methods and mechanisms for incorporating the printed circuit.<BR>o	Optimal placement of the circuit on the package or unit load for effective monitoring.<BR>o	Compatibility of the circuit device with various packaging ma terials such as stretch-wrap, flexible films, and/or corrugated boxes.<BR><BR>f)  Identify and estimate the anticipated costs of the printed and other circuit components and the circuit device, unit costs, and anticipated economies of scale for the integra ted circuit and the entire packaging system(s) at the pallet and/or shipping case level.  Because the final system must be cost effective, the Contractor shall develop cost estimates for producing and applying components -- to include the circuitry, sensor s, power (e.g., battery, super-capacitor), thin film display, microprocessor, and switches -- and integrated circuits into the packaging systems.  As a reference, the 2005 MRE procurement was 3.4 million cases, or approximately 71,000 pallets (at 48 cases of MREs per pallet).<BR><BR>g)  Obtain product samples of printed electronic components and circuit/display devices from the companies contacted during the course of the research.<BR><BR>h)  If possible, an initial concept diagram for the integrated circui t should be prepared.  <BR><BR>	The results of the investigation shall be summarized in a final market investigation report, which shall be prepared on completion of the survey.  The final report shall include summaries of the above gathered information, t o include all relevant printed electronics technologies identified (components, circuits, and systems), current research and development efforts in the field, descriptions of the most suitable family of technologies, sources employing the technology, parti al solutions which together may meet the desired system characteristics, and the potential for dual-use with industry and for military fielding within three to five years.  The final report shall also include background and/or survey particulars, discussio ns of issues including potential trade-offs (e.g., cost, compatibility, etc.), any known technical barriers, and descriptions, specifications, or test data of the suitable components and systems.  Any technical literature, materials specifications, and pro duct samples that are obtained will also be provided to NSRDEC with the final report.  Additionally, the Contractor Officers Representative may request brief, written progress reports monthly or bimonthly throughout the duration of the contract.<BR><BR>	The Contractor shall, upon award of contract and continuing for the total contract period, furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, materials, components  and supplies required to conduct a thorough investigation.  Upon award of contract, the Contractor shall contact the NSRDEC technical point of contact to discuss the minimal essential characteristics of the candidate packaging system(s), which are summari zed below.  The period of performance for this work effort shall be nine months from date of award, with the final report completed NLT 30 days after completion of the investigation.<BR><BR><BR>Desired Characteristics of Intelligent Ration Packaging System  Utilizing Printed Electronics<BR><BR>a)  A printed central intelligence circuit/platform that uses conductive inks or other specialty inks on substrates and fuses multiple sensor data to provide consolidated real-time or on-demand output on ration status to a printed thin film display.  This circuit may include printed integrated sensors, shelf life estimation algorithm, memory (to store all sensor and shelf life data generated and to save power), battery, thin-film display, and optionally, a transceiver.  In other words, capabilities could all be internally incorporated on a chip to flash a visual signal on a printed display.  The entire central circuit with actual components could be printed in fewer steps as compared to current circuit boards made with s oldered components.<BR><BR>b)  The circuit would be incorporated into ration packaging materials, e.g., applied as a label to plastic stretch wrap, to one optimal location on the unit load by the film producer or ration assembler.  <BR><BR>c)  Data will be  fed into an algorithm or computer program.  It is envisioned that the algorithm will run on a printed microprocessor or implemented directly in analog or digital hardware.  <BR><BR>d)  The key feature of the system will be a real-time or on-demand shelf l ife expiration date output via printed electronic display.  The final system does not have to be a perfect indicator of remaining shelf life; but it should not over-estimate the remaining shelf life.  The accuracy of a sensor-based math model should exceed  that of the current printed ration termination date and manual product rotation methods.  <BR><BR>o	Shelf life forecasting algorithms would read data from environmental sensors (e.g., temperature) on the circuit to compute the estimated remaining shelf li fe of rations based on environmental storage history (e.g., food degradation curves over time as a function of temperature).  The algorithm would receive and process the data from the sensors and automatically stream the estimated remaining shelf life to t he electronic display to give a visual indication of ration status.  <BR><BR>o	The algorithm could be designed to display data at pre-determined intervals or continuously, based on the power profile of the thin film batteries.  This system would therefore eliminate the need for a hand-held reader to query individual sensor tags and download data.  <BR><BR>e)  The circuit could also be designed, via the use of a transceiver or other broadcasting feature or chip, to simultaneously broadcast pallet location, s helf life expiration, or tampering information to a server, cell phone, or computer in real-time to alert military food inspectors or DoD logisticians. <BR><BR>f)  The ultimate system should be a stand-alone, complementary set of technologies to provide en tirely new capabilities.  However, we believe that the existing RFID infrastructure could be leveraged so that the readers and the data storage and transmission protocols are compatible with these devices as well.  <BR><BR>g)  This system would record temp erature and humidity data and turn them into actionable information via an expiration date or simple iconic indicators on a printed display -- effectively and e fficiently in real-time and all the time.  In a warehouse, personnel could look at pallets or boxes and make a decision as to which ones need to be moved first by looking at the electronic display on the pallet (or ration case/box, if affordable, needed, f easible etc.).  <BR><BR>h)  Possibilities for design of the final system could include:  <BR>o	A printed display only (no broadcast chip), e.g., This ration expires in X days.<BR>o	A printed display and option of broadcasting:<BR>"	Broadcast independently of any existing infrastructure to PDA, cell phone, server, pager, etc.<BR>"	Broadcast using existing RFID ITV servers and network only (e.g., to assist<BR>"	warehouse personnel in prioritizing shipments)<BR>"	Broadcast independently to a PDA and to the ITV  server.  For example, broad cast to the POC or Commander at the Unit Level Overseas.

Questions in reference to solicitation:

1.) What is the number of users?
Answer: The number of users can vary with how many groups we turn it on for. We have as many as 5000 when we include all the alumni and adjunct faculty, but if a title is too expensive to buy for everyone we usually just buy it for the people who are here, which is more like 2000.

2.) What is the number of full-time employees (FTEs)
Answer: We have about 900 students, 400 faulty and 400 full-time staff.

3.) Number of IP addresses?
Answer: 8 total IP addresses

4.) Number of simultaneous users?
Answer: This all depends on the title, but for all of these titles we would want 1 simultaneous user.

5.) Do you want a site license for any of the titles?
Answer: Yes. Anything electronic there has to be a site license for the whole university with remote access, whenever possible.

Will you pay extra for online access or do you only want those that are free with print?
Answer: On the list where it says Online only, Print only, or Print & Online we want electronic and are willing to do without print if necessary. The titles that say Print only we want only in print form.

Note: We are a University as well as Government. If the only online version they offer is a one user at one machine version, that will not work for the university. It has to allow at least the people here on campus to access the title and preferably people not on campus. We have an electronic resource portal which offers secure access only to people with a user ID and password.

This amendment also extends the bid submissi on deadline to January 9, 2008 4:00PM CST. This amendment will remove the Statement Can test the non-self-contained transmissions found in earth moving equipment from the original solicitation.<BR><BR>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS<BR><BR><BR>Requisition No.:  W91S DR73250009	SOLICITATION: W9124L-08-T-0012<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: Transmission Dynamometer<BR><BR> <BR>Question 1: Will this be located at Fort Sill?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 2: We are presuming two brakes are required (dual dynamometer l oad unit).  This is <BR>considered normal for testing transmission units with dual outputs and similar (if not identical) <BR>to full axle dynes.<BR> a)  Are these brakes specified as eddy current?  Or something else?<BR> b)  What is the maximum horsepower  required of these brakes?<BR>Answer:  a)       Yes, specified as eddy current.   b)  200<BR><BR>Question 3: While most transmission dynes can indeed test hydraulic motors and pumps, <BR>what is meant by must test valves and cylinders?  <BR>Answer:  Must t est the valves that work the cylinders.<BR><BR>Question 4: (Continued from question 3) We understand these items could be part of a <BR>complete hydraulic circuit which must be tested, however how could a dyne test a large <BR>cylinder?   It appears furthe r definition is warranted.<BR>Answer:  Research shows many dynes on the market capable of testing large cylinders. <BR>How you choose to do it is your decision<BR><BR>Question 5:  Is the hydraulic power supply (5GPM and 500 psi) also required as part of th e <BR>dyne?<BR>Answer:  Yes, but it should be up to 5000 psi<BR><BR>Question 6:  How are manual transmissions to be shifted?<BR>Answer:  All are automatic transmissions<BR><BR>Question 7:  Is there a requirement to automate the operation of clutch and shif t functions?<BR>Answer:  All are automatic transmissions<BR><BR>Question 8:  It is not clear if the dyne must also test complete vehicles as well?<BR>      Or just the transmissions on said vehicles?<BR>      [Per the solicitation: Some examples of milita ry vehicles to be tested include but are not <BR>limited to:     HEMTT- Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (M985)  HEMTT <BR>WRECKER (M984A1) PLS---PALLETIZED LOADING SYSTEM M88A1--RECOVER <BR>VEHICLE M1A1--ABRAMS BATTLE TANK HET-  HEAVY  EQUIPMENT <BR >TRANSPORT TRUCK ( M1070)]<BR>      This is an important distinction since chassis dynes are not the same as transmission or <BR>axle dynes.<BR>Answer:  No chassis, just transmissions and hydraulic cylinders<BR><BR>Question 9:  The first Bullet Point under  Specifications for Dynamometer:   Transmission <BR>Dynamometer that will test all military transmissions:  Can we change this statement to <BR>Transmission Dynamometer that will test all military transmissions currently being repaired <BR>and require t esting at Ft. Sill to there associated DMWR which are listed below.  Additionally <BR>the Dynamometer needs to be reasonably up-gradable to test the list of other Future <BR>transmissions listed below<BR>(Ft.

Allison CD850-6A		NMWR 9-25 20-233<BR>vi.	CAT D7155			DMWR 9-2520-523<BR><BR>Answer:  No. If your machine will test all military transmissions, then the DMWR and <BR>NMWR standards will be  met.<BR>Question 10:  Please supply a complete list of transmissions to be tested?  The list should be <BR>based on Transmission manufacture and model name.<BR>Answer:  Reference question 39 for current list of transmission being tested in <BR>accordance with the DMWR and NMWR standards.<BR><BR>Question 11:  Please supply the assocciated test procedure for each of the listed transmissions <BR>for testing.?  This will be the DMWR or NMWR<BR>Answer:  Testing procedures will be in accordance with the DMWR and  NMWR <BR>standards.<BR><BR>Question 12:  It is important to supply the proper DMWR to test the transmission to.  We can <BR>mount and operte a transmission but what we want to make sure is that we are supply a <BR>dynamometer that is able to test it to th e DMWR requiremetns. Example<BR><BR>*	M1A1 Tank uses a X1100-3B Cross Drive Transmission.  This transmission <BR>can be tested using the DMWR 9-2520-276-3.  This DMWR requires the <BR>transmission dynamometer to have an input AC motor of over 400 H.P. with  a <BR>150% overload drive capacity.   This system also requires an input torque meter <BR>to properly follow the DMWR specifications.  This seems to be one of the <BR>transmissions you requested althogh in the list it is listed as a recovery vehicle.  <BR >Is this one of the transmission you want to test and is this the correct DMWR? <BR><BR>*	One of the Hummer transmission is the 3L80.  An exisitng DMWR-9-2520-581 <BR>request a specific inertia weight (20.8 slug ft2) to be used on the output of the <BR>tra nsmission along with a large loading power aborber.  Will this test procedure <BR>be required to be performed.?<BR><BR>*	It is very important to provide the required test procedure or DMWR for every <BR>transmission to be tested.  If not, the required test ing perameters must meet the <BR>maximum performance specification as requirested in the DMWR.<BR><BR>*	For tesing the XT1410 there are currently two DMWRs that can be used to test <BR>the trasmission New and Old .  To performe the different test proce dures <BR>requires greatly different dynamometers capabilites.  <BR><BR>Dyne Requirement<BR>Old Test Procedure<BR>New Test <BR>Procedure<BR>Input Motor Power<BR>200 Hp<BR>600 Hp<BR>Input Motor Torque<BR>745 lb-ft<BR>1,500 lb-ft<BR>Input Motor Speed<BR>2360  rpm<BR>2,400 rpm<BR>Input Torque Measurement<BR>Yes<BR>Yes<BR>Output Stall Brake<BR>3,300 lb-ft measured<BR>16,500 lb-ft capable<BR>30,000 lb-ft<BR>Output PAU Power<BR>None<BR>300 Hp<BR>Output PAU Torque<BR>None<BR>5,053 lb-ft @ <BR>304rpm<BR>Output PAU S peed<BR>None<BR>1631 rpm<BR>Output Decouple<BR>None<BR>Yes<BR>Output Park Prawl<BR>None<BR>None<BR>Steer Actuator<BR>Yes<BR>Yes<BR>Shift Actuator<BR>Yes<BR>Yes<BR><BR>The same transmission being tested with different test procedures have <BR>dramatic diffe rences in the dynamometer equipment ( 200 HP input motor vs. <BR>600+ hp input motor, output stall loads from 3,300 to 30,000 lb-ft).  We will <BR>need to determine which test procedure you intend to follow prior to sizing the <BR>system. <BR>Answer:  The main drive system should be 200hp capable of at least 580 ftlbs torque at <BR>6000 psi<BR><BR>Question 13:  Must the transmission dynamometer have optional Oil System supplied in the <BR>offer or does Fort Sill have their own system?   <BR><BR>*	Oil Heat E xchanger / Cooling Circuit, Oil Fill System, Oil Reservoir, Oil <BR>Reservoir Heater and the measurement of the oil in the system, Temp, Pressure <BR>and Flow.  Some transmissions have more than just an in and out oil circuit but <BR>they have branch circu its that need to be controlled and measured. So the oil <BR>system is a critical item when specifying the transmission dynamometer.<BR>Answer:  Must have its own oil supply system<BR><BR>Question 14:  Must the transmission dynamometer have Transmission Con trols?<BR><BR>*	The Control of the transmission Gear Selection, Brakes (hydraulic and service), <BR>Steering require monitoring and control.  Some transmissions  require actuators <BR>that measure the amount force applied to the transmission as well as the amount <BR>of rotation.  Other transmission types have hydraulic operated external valve <BR>tower which hydraulically controls the transmission.  Why even othe r <BR>transmission have electronic controllers to control the shifting of the <BR>transmission.  Mustang has encountered all of these different Transmission <BR>Control requirements.  <BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 15:  Must the transmission dynamometer have Data Acquisition?<BR><BR>*	The amount and type of data acquisition depends on the transmissions test <BR>procedure.  Some test procedures require the measurement of the input torque, <BR>brake force, steer angle, oil flow, oil temp,  while other requi re up to 9 <BR>pressures to be monitored and the flow of multiple oil paths to be monitored.  <BR>Mustang typically supplies spare channels for future needs in our data <BR>acquisition systems.  <BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 16:  Does the customer syste m have to come with a printer?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 17:  Does the control system have to prompt the operator through the test?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 18:  Is there a requirment for a print out at the end of the test wit relevant <BR>inf ormation from the test?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 19:  Must the transmission dynamometer have Output Inertia?<BR><BR>*	Does the test procedure require inertia loading?  If so we add the appropriate <BR>amount to meet the customers test procedure req uirements.  This again is test <BR>procedure dependent whereby some test procedures require it and others do not.<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 20:  You ask for dual dynamometer load units but you do  not specify the amount of <BR>load they need to suppl y.  What is the maximum dynamic output torque and Power required <BR>by the output PAUs to meet your testing requirements?<BR><BR>*	The size of the Output PAU if required at all is dependent on the test procedure.  <BR>The speed and torque capacity is typ ically outlined in the test procedure.  In <BR>many cases the amount of output torque is very great at low speeds and less at <BR>higher speeds.  Again when looking at the different test procedures between <BR>some cross drive transmissions some of the tes t procedures let say for the <BR>HMPT-500 series of transmissions require a large amount of low speed <BR>dynamic output torque (5,600 lb-ft @ 70 rpm) and other larger cross drive <BR>transmissions X-1100-3B for the M1 Battle Tank only requires a 1,500 lb- ft of <BR>output torque for short periods of time to validate a forced down shift <BR>requirement although the output speed is as high 3200 rpm.  <BR>Answer:  Torque output and power required will be based upon the standards of the <BR>DMWR and NMWR that i s required to test the transmissions listed in question 39, with <BR>the ability to upgrade in the future<BR><BR>Question 21:  What is the maximum static transmission output torque required to be applied <BR>by the output Stall Lock system to meet your tes ting requirements?<BR>Answer:  Outputs will be based on the DMWR and NMWR standards.<BR><BR>Question 22:  There is a bullet Can test the non-self-contained transmissions found in earth <BR>moving equipment  Please list the transmission you are refereing to based on manufacture <BR>name and model number.?  <BR>Answer:  Earth moving equipment has been removed from the list.<BR>Question 23:  Based on your listed transmissions there seems to be In-line and crossdrive <BR>requested althogh our expierence with the earth moving equipment may require a drop box or <BR>power shift transmission.  <BR>c.	Allision AT, MT, HT are all in-line transmissions although they could <BR>potentially be fitted with drop boxes.  Do any of these have drop boxes?  Do <BR>any of the se have ATEC electronicn transmission controllers?<BR>d.	The earth moving equipment transmission may be in remote mount or direct <BR>engine mount can you detai l this for us?  Some will have a remote torque <BR>converter mounted.  So please supply transmission list and mounting <BR>configuration along with the test Procedure.<BR>e.	The Listed Vehicles in the specification primarly use Allison HT and CLT 700 <BR>t ransmission along with the Allison X1100 and the XT1410 crossdrive <BR>transmissions.  What other transmission will you be testing? <BR>Answer:  Earth moving equipment has been removed from the list.  Please refer to <BR>Question 39 for current list.<BR>Qu estion 24:  The word can is used repeatedly. Does this mean the system must be shipped <BR>from the factory pre-configured for doing these features, or does this mean the machine shall <BR>be able to be updated some time in the future to have these featu res?<BR>Answer:  Must be shipped from the factory pre-configured and ready to use, with the <BR>capability to be upgraded as new transmissions are produced.<BR><BR>Question 25:  Must be able to test is used. Does this mean the system shall be furnished < BR>with all of the required adapters and supports to connect the listed transmissions to the input <BR>drive and to the output load unit(s)?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 26:  What is the minimum required horsepower desired for driving the <BR>transmissi ons?<BR>Answer:  200 hp<BR><BR>Question 27:  What is the required power absorption of each of the two dynamometer load <BR>units?<BR>Answer:  Whatever is required to test our transmissions in accordance with DMWR and <BR>NMWR standards.<BR><BR>Question 28:   Does installation mean placement of the machine into position, or just <BR>connection to suitable customer provided power disconnect box? <BR>Answer:  All equipment must be installed into position and connected to the power box.<BR><BR>Question 29:  Who is to furnish the materials to connect the machine to the building utilities <BR>and how far away from the machine will they be located?<BR>Answer:  The vendor shall supply all materials, labor and equipment required to fulfill <BR>this request. The machin e will be located approximately 30 ft away from the building <BR>utilities.<BR><BR>Question 30:  Is an adaptation kit including, input drive connection, output load connection <BR>and support for the HEMTT transmission (985) required?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><B R>Question 31:  Is an adaptation kit including, input drive connection, output load connection <BR>and support for the HEMTT Wrecker transmission (M984A1) required?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 32:  Is an adaptation kit including, input drive connection , output load connection <BR>and support for the PLS transmission required?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 33:  Is an adaptation kit including, input drive connection, output load connection <BR>and support for the M88A1 recovery Vehicle transmission requ ired?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 34:  Is an adaptation kit including, input drive connection, output load connection <BR>and support for the M1A1 Abrams tank transmission required?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 35:  Is an adaptation kit including, i nput drive connection, output load connection <BR>and support for the HET (M1070) transmission required?<BR>Yes<BR><BR>Question 36:  What are the defining criteria for the small business set aside?<BR>Answer:  <BR>The contracting officer can choose to issu e a total small business set-aside for an <BR>acquisition if there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least <BR>two responsible small business concerns.<BR>Question 37:  If the transmissions are electronically shifted, are we to provide the complete <BR>electronic control system for shifting the transmission?<BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>Question 38:  Is automated control of the dynamometer system and data acquisition required <BR>to be supplied?<BR>Yes<BR><BR>Question 39:  Please id entify either the transmission models or the equipment variants so that <BR>all adapter and shifter kits may be competitively quoted.<BR>Answer:  General Motors  THM-400 and 350 Turbo Hydromatic, FMC HS400-3A1, <BR>Clark HR28320, HR 18325, and 18340,  Caterpillar, Allison AT545, all CD 850-6, all HT <BR>700, all MT 600, TX 100-1 and 1A, X1100-3B, x 200-4, all XT 1410, XTG 411-2A, with <BR>the ability to be upgrade d to other transmissions as needed.
