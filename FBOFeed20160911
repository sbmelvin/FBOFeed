<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  This is not a request for proposals.  A solicitation will not be issued at this time.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) has a requirement for Ventana.  The intent of the procurement is to award a firm-fixed price contract.   The Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the purchase and delivery of the system to the Tucson VA.  
Unique Features: This project encompasses patient care across the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) continuum.  The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service requires reagents and supplies for three stainers which are used in the SAVAHCS Histology Laboratory.  These stainers are used daily for Routine H&E Staining, Special Staining, Immunohistochemical Staining, In-Situ Hybridization, and Direct Immunofluorescent Staining of patient tissue which had been placed onto glass microscope slides. All tissue specimens removed from SAVAHCS patients are processed by the Histology Laboratory and very thin sections of tissue are placed on glass microscope slides.  These sections of patient tissue are subjected to various automated staining methods, after which the cells of the stained tissue are microscopically analyzed by the Anatomic Pathologist for patient diagnosis.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES</strong><br />The Animal Biosciences &amp; Biotechnology Laboratory (ABBL) at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), Agricultural Research Services (ARS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) intends to issue a sole source, fixed price purchase order for pathway metabolic profiling services to the following source: Metabolon PO Box 110407, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27709 in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) under simplified acquisition procedures. The proposed award is being issued under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (b)(i), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />ABBL requires Metabolon, Inc. located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina for profiling services due to the nature of analysis and the uniformity of results required. Metabolon provided profiling services for ABBL in FY15 and the pathway profiling now required is a continuation of research analysis. The uniformity of results over time is highly dependent on the nature of the mass spectroscopy platforms and protocols that provide the analysis. Changing any aspects of the analytical platform at this point in the experimental process would, for all intent and purposes, negate the validity of the results since it would be impossible to distinguish metabolic profile changes that were the result of imposed treatment effects from those due to random variation and artifact in the analytical method especially as regards the sensitivity of the method.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 541990; small business size standard is $15.0 million.
<p>The government will consider all responsible sources received by the due date. Written responses must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona-fide capability to fulfill the requirement. If no written responses are received, a purchase order will be issued without further notice.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0184, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil.

Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.<br />(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or Security Forces for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and other information as required by the registration office to obtain a vehicle pass.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. <br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with the requirements of AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management citing the appropriate paragraphs as applicable.<br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)<br />REJECTION OF UNREALISTIC OFFERS: <br />Any proposal which is unrealistic will be judged either as exhibiting a lack of competence or failure to comprehend the Government's requirements and may be so evaluated and rated, or rejected for such reasons. Furthermore, any significant inconsistency between the Technical Proposal and Price Proposal, if unexplained, may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly IAW its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's proposal. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as a promise by the Government to conduct a price realism analysis where it would otherwise not be required to do so. The decision to conduct or not to conduct such an analysis remains in the sound discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers based on prices proposed for all CLINs and any other price related factors required by the solicitation. The offeror's quote will be evaluated for Reasonableness, Realism, and Total Evaluated Price.</p>
<p>1. Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of reasonableness. Price analysis techniques may be used to further validate price reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis, other techniques will be used.</p>
<p>2. Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The Government will utilize the following methodology to determine the TEP of each proposal. The TEP will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The TEP will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>i. CLINs will be calculated by multiplying the proposed unit price by the corresponding quantity.<br />ii. The sum of all the CLINs evaluated prices will represent the total evaluated price <br />iii. Award will be made to the responsible offeror that represents the best value to the US Government.</p>
<p><br />Prospective vendors should also provide payment terms, delivery time, FOB (destination or origin), name, address, contact info, cage code, federal tax ID, and DUNS numbers. Vendors should also be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).</p>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Communications Technology Laboratory (CTL) is in the process of expanding its research efforts related to spectrum sharing in wireless communications at frequencies up to 6 GHz. This research spans topics associated with distributed spectrum sensing, signal propagation, interference between devices and networks, and evaluating a device's ability to share spectrum.</p>
<p>The Shared Spectrum Metrology (SSM) group seeks to build a fundamental measurement capability in electromagnetic fields, the physical basis of wireless communications. The field includes electric field components along three axes in space - for example, left-to-right, up-to-down, and front-to-back.</p>
<p>The electric field probe is the instrument that measures electric fields. State-of-the-art probes can measure fields on all three axes simultaneously, which is essential for capturing the complete contributions of the fields along each axis onto the total electric field.  Recent probe designs also support power and communication transfer by laser over fiber optic links, removing the need for metal cables. The purchase of this type of commercial 3-axis laser-powered electric field measurement system will give NIST a field measurement capability that matches the technology that industry and test houses use when they implement NIST-developed measurement methods.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK - VALET PARKING
SALT LAKE CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER
GENERAL 
The contractor shall provide valet parking services at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 500 Foothill Blvd, Salt Lake City, Utah 84109, in accordance with the following provisions. Approximately 400 parking spaces are available for full valet parking. The contractor shall be responsible for greeting valet customers, managing claim tickets, parking vehicles, securing keys and retrieving vehicles for the period specified in accordance with all terms, conditions, schedules, provisions, and requirements of this solicitation and any resultant contract. 

QUALIFICATIONS 
Offers will be considered only from contractors who are regularly established in the business called for and whom in the judgment of the Contracting Officer are financially responsible and able to show evidence of their reliability, ability, experience, and personnel directly employed or supervised by them to render satisfactory services. The contractor shall, upon request, promptly furnish the Government with a current certified financial statement. 

WORK HOURS 
Hours of operations are 7:00am to 5:00pm Monday - Friday, excluding Federal Holidays, and any other day specifically declared by the President of the United States to be a Federal Holiday. 
The ten (10) holidays observed by the Federal Government are: New Year's Day, Birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
REQUIREMENTS 
Approximately 2200 vehicles utilize the existing parking garage on the VA campus (see attached traffic counts).  This parking garage will be undergoing an addition that will shut down the garage for approximately 18 months.  This contract will be required before, during and after this construction project and the contractor will need to accommodate fluctuations in valet demand accordingly. The amount of available parking spaces to accommodate patients, staff, volunteers and visitors on any given day is limited. The need is for a contractor to park and/or provide assistance in parking to veteran patients and visitors only, five days per week. There will be Government-provided wheelchairs available to assist patients to the front entrance of Building 1. The contractor shall be completely liable and responsible for providing patients and visitors with a valet claim check (or similar system), securing keys, parking, delivering, and directing certain valet vehicles to and from the valet greeting area. The contract period is for a base year (6 months) plus one option year. 
Vehicles requiring Valet Parking shall be stopped by the contractor's employee, who shall ask the driver/passengers about the purpose of their visit and the estimated time of departure. If the reason for the visit is appropriate, the attendants shall provide a claim ticket and park the car in a space based on the length of stay. If the vehicle does not qualify for valet parking, the attendant will direct the vehicle to a parking lot for self-parking.  All vehicles parked by the contractor's parking attendants will be locked and secured. Driver's keys will be physically secured at the valet booth. When a parking patron returns for their car, they will give the attendant their claim check; and the attendant will deliver the car for easy exiting. The contractor's parking attendant shall move any vehicle still on the premises after valet parking hours to the parking garage and turn the keys over to the Administrator on Duty (AOD). Owners of these vehicles will contact the AOD to pick up their keys. In the event of a lost claim check, vehicle owners will be referred to the VA Police for resolution. No vehicle shall be released without a claim check or direction from the VA Police.
The contractor shall operate from the designated entrance area between Building 1 and the Parking Garage. Only VA patients and visitors are permitted to use the valet service. A tag will be hung from the rear-view mirror of all valet parked vehicles to quickly identify the vehicle as authorized to be in valet parking space or a similar process. The valet contractor shall be responsible for parking control and monitoring of valet parking areas for unauthorized vehicles. The contractor shall report any violations to VA Police. 
With the exception of an interior space located at the valet parking entrance, a telephone, wheelchairs and the valet parking spaces, it is the intent of this statement of work for the contractor to provide all other items necessary for a successful and efficient valet parking operation. The telephone shall be for local telephone calls only so that parking patrons/VA staff can communicate with the attendants and for use in emergencies. All questions about the valet parking operation will be directed to this telephone. The contractor shall be responsible for providing any additional telephone service if the contractor wishes to make long distance/toll calls. 
The following list is known items to be supplied by the contractor, but may not be all-inclusive. The contractor shall provide a locking key cabinet(s) and ticket dispenser(s) to be located in the Government provided valet area. The contractor shall furnish and install all signs needed for the Government provided valet area. Signs directing patients to the free valet parking drop-off point will designate days and hours of operation and indicate, "No tipping". A sign shall be furnished and installed on the Valet Parking Podium and at the vehicle drop-off point that outlines the procedure for vehicle owners and identifies valet parking as free for VA Patients as well as the "no tipping" policy. The "no tipping" policy will be strictly enforced. Contractor's employees shall be restricted from accepting tips of any kind. Signs shall be posted at necessary locations in each valet lot to restrict access from non-valet parked vehicles. Signs shall be in accordance with VA signage regulations. Hand-written signs are not allowed. Prior to installation, the sign must be approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).
The contractor shall provide uniforms (including outerwear, jackets, hats, etc.) to all personnel working under this contract. Uniforms shall facilitate easy identification of contractor employees by employee name and company name. Uniforms shall be consistent in style and color and be worn at all times during performance of contract duties. All uniform styles shall be approved by the COR prior to implementation.
The contractor shall be responsible to ensure its employees providing work on this contract are fully trained and completely competent to perform the required work. All parking attendants shall be trained in providing excellent customer service demonstrating courtesy, kindness, and caring. Orientation and training of contractor employees shall be documented in writing to the COR. All contractor employees serving as parking attendants shall possess a valid driver's license, be US Citizens and be fluent in the English language. Parking patrons shall be treated courteously and with respect at all times. Contractor's employees shall be neat and clean in appearance. 
The contractor shall designate in writing an employee to act in a supervisory capacity and as representative of the contractor in handling any valet parking concerns. If this person is not present on site, the contractor shall designate another employee, in writing, as "acting" during the period of absence.
Parking attendants shall assist parking patrons by removing wheelchairs and carts from their automobiles and holding umbrellas for patrons exiting their vehicles during inclement weather. Parking attendants shall drive slowly and cautiously, paying attention to pedestrian traffic. 
The VA will provide lot maintenance, cleaning, repair and snow removal services in the parking areas involved in this contract. The contractor shall notify the VA of any areas that may pose a safety hazard to patients, employees, and visitors. Any suspicious activity occurring in valet parking areas shall be reported to VA police. 

CLAIMS/DAMAGES 
Any claims of damage or problems with customers' vehicles will be directed to and handled by the contractor in coordination with the Contracting Officer, if required. 
Any claims of damage or missing/stolen property involving customer's vehicles shall be the responsibility of the contractor. The VA assumes no responsibility for such claims.  All incidents of reported damage or missing/stolen property shall be reported to VA Police.
PERFORMANCE STANDARD 
The contractor shall staff the valet parking operation with an appropriate number of employees as required demonstrating an efficient operation. An efficient operation is defined as: No vehicle waits more than 5 minutes to be valet parked and 10 minutes to be retrieved 95% of the time. The COR will audit the turnaround time to assure contractor compliance. The contractor's ability to manage the traffic flow will be periodically audited to assure that the contractor is putting the Veteran first and providing a safe and efficient operation.  Traffic shall not back up onto Foothill Drive and it shall be the contractor's responsibility to manage traffic flow.

The contractor shall provide a mechanism for feedback from valet users and provide summary report monthly.
The COR will make periodic unannounced inspections to ensure that waiting times do not exceed 5 minutes and that all contract requirements are being met. Any incidences of contract noncompliance will be reported to the Contracting Officer.
The COR may request immediate removal and replacement of any contract employee found not representative of the image of a professional health care organization regarding appearance, behavior, professional attitude, and other causes deemed tarnishing of the image of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
REPORTS 
The contractor shall submit monthly reports directly to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) within 15 days of month's end. The reports shall include invoices summarizing the number of vehicles valet parked by date and hour and the total charges for the month. The report shall also indicate by date, any unusual events of the day.

Custom-made fabrication/design industrial hospital dishwasher with components for clean dish tables and soiled dish tables integrated with a new Hobart dishwasher, conveyor type Model # CL44E+Buildup. The dish machine is used for cleaning system for institutional pots and pans. 
The warewashing space is currently redesigned that includes for  improved workflow of soiled to clean pots/pans, and to repurpose the work space.. The clean/soiled dish tables are custom manufactured to fit into the available work space.  The washer is required for Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS), Little Rock, AR  72204.

3.	Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

0  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

1  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)) or

0  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)

4.	Rational/explanation to support cited authority: 
Gill Marketing is the only source that is capable of providing the custom manufacturing within the projected time table for procurement in conjunction with the Hobart warewashing equipment.  Gill Marketing has redesign of the warewashing space including improved workflow of soiled to clean pots/pans. The clean/soiled dish tables are custom manufactured to fit into the available work space. Their work is  uniqueand highly specialized in their ability to custom design warewashing equipment to fit into existing space improving workflow settings.
Gill Marketing provides a custom-made pot/pan washer with tables for clean and dirty that meets solely the compatibility for CAVHS.  The SOILED DISH TABLE "L" SHAPE? 14 gauge stainless steel top with 10" back splash at walls. Pre?rinse sink with lever drain, overflow & perforated scrap basket/rack guide. Table to include (1) faucet & (1) pre?rinse sprayer. Table has no undershelving. Top to be sound
deadened. Table to be supported on 1?5/8" diameter stainless steel
legs with adjustable feet.
CLEAN DISH TABLE "L" SHAPE? 14 gauge stainless steel top with 10"
back splash at walls. Table to have partial length stainless steel tubular
undershelving. Top to be sound deadened. Unit to be supported on 1?
5/8" diameter stainless steel legs with crossbracing & adjustable feet.
All of the washer tables height, length, and width are custom-made to meet space capacity within existing sq foot of the facility.  
Clean/soiled dish tables customized to the existing space; Hobart CL44e dishwashing machine is specifically designed to fit into existing space with existing duct work and provide for side loading with front access.  Volume capacity of 200+ racks/hour and 208/60/3 electrical connections, 30kW electric booster-208v, right to left operation.  Installation including labor and materials as needed to disconnect existing equipment from utilities, disassemble and move to loading dock. 
The manufacturer will ship equipment at loading dock, uncrate, move into place, assemble and make final connections to existing utilities and new electric provided by facility. Modify, install new ductwork to accommodate new machine. Start up and test and make ready for use.
CL44e is the only dishwasher that can provide for side loading and front access with these restrictive dimensions.  This is known per industrial catalog review by the technical subject-matter expert.  Without a side loading and front access dishwasher with custom tables the negative impact would occur through increased labor cost, as employees would have to more labor.   In addition, the front access would benefit through increased effeciencies such as cleaning, preventative maintentaince, and future repairs for longer life span of equipment.
Installation must be completed by a authorized Gill Marketing techncians and cannot be outsourced.  No other vendors are authorized to sell the equipment or the complete the installation.  Vendor have to meet all utility codes per the local ordinances.  


5.	BRAND NAME ONLY:  This buy is estimated to exceed $25,000 and this documentation will be posted along with the RFQ on e-Buy, as required by FAR 8.405-6(b)(3).

6.	Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.
