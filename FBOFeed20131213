<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III. Firm-Fixed-Price Level-of-Effort, IDIQ:  To support training, overhaul, depot-level maintenance and recapitalization of CROWS; and for general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification will consist of performance requirements and will specify technical drawings.  The detail specification will specify the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and/or how the items are to be fabricated or constructed.  Some sub-assemblies will not include technical drawings and assembly procedures.  Instead, data for those sub-assemblies will include directed source(s) or build-to-spec requirements or both.

Approved source is: Armatec Survivability Corp (L0782).<br />(X)While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.<br />(X)The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.<br />(X) Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<br />(X) This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Class: 25 and 95.<br />(X) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

This procurement will entail Customer Direct Deliveries to locations throughout the South Central Region/respective zones. There are existing regular customers in the South Central Region at this time. For Zone 1, the acquisition is estimated at $30,000,000.00 per year with a total contract maximum value of $225,000,000.00.

All items are commercial and identified by a manufacturer's part number and/or commercial item description.
<p>For each zone, proposals will be evaluated using Best Value Tradeoff Source Selection procedures with the non-price factors being significantly more important than price.

<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 811219 with a Size Standard of $19.0 million.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY</span></strong></p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-71.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATUTORY AUTHORITY</span></strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>The Imaging Probe Development Center (IPDC) is currently in the process of opening a new Positron Emission Tomography (PET) lab. In the NHLBI/DIR laboratory, molecular probes of different imaging modalities will be synthesized for noninvasive imaging studies. The primary goal of the researchers of this new PET lab will be to develop new probes for PET imaging or reproduce already existing imaging agent for further studies. Determining the progress of the reactions by characterizing the intermediates in each steps are very important. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is universally recognized as a powerful tool to analyze the reaction mixtures and identify the final products. This is one of the essential equipments in any small molecule based biomedical research laboratory.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span></strong></p>
<p>In the new imaging probe development laboratory this equipment will be used as a powerful and reliable analytical tool. Analytical data (retention time, peak shape, absorbance) produced by HPLC are regarded as an authentic characterization data of a molecule.</p>
<p>The new PET laboratory will be making different kinds of imaging probes to support the biomedical research of NIH investigators. So this equipment will be used to support the research effort of several investigators of NIH. Overall, it will be a valuable asset to the Government researchers.</p>
<p>Based on the nature of work, the laboratory needs an efficient and reliable HPLC system. The instrument must have a global warranty, i.e. all parts including software should be under warranty or annual service contract.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance</span></strong></p>
<p>A fixed price purchase order for a one (1) year period of performance from the time of award.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Responsibilities:<br /></span><br />Vendors shall perform following tasks:<br /><br />1. Install the equipment and familiarize lab staff with the equipment. <br />2. A performance check out sample will be run at the time of installation to ensure proper performance. The vendor will supply the check standard.<br />3. Vendor is responsible to send/deliver the equipment with proper packaging. <br />4. Vendor is 100% liable of any damage during shipping and handling of the equipment <br />5. Equipment will come with warranty. Any kind of damage or malfunctioning (software and hardware) during the warranty will be fixed by the vendor without any cost.<br />6. Standard warranty is one year. The customer may purchase extended warranty and/or support contracts upon expiration of the standard warranty.<br />7. Software upgrades are included under the standard warranty period and may be included as an option to extended support coverage. <br />8. Government should expect from vendor very smooth, hassle free maintenance of the equipment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Responsibilities:</span></p>
<p>The government, i.e. laboratory will provide adequate space (2.5' X 5' bench top) and a power connection to install the equipment. Installation and other maintenance should be done by the authorized person of the vendor. Government cannot use another person who is not authorized by the vendor. <br />Inspection and Acceptance:<br /><br />1. Equipment will be received by NIH receiving department or by the laboratory staff.<br />2. Equipment will only be accepted after proper installation and successful demonstration in the laboratory by the vendors.<br />3. Installation and demonstration done by the vendor should be approved by the laboratory staff. Agilent has set procedures in place for installation and familiarization. This checklist may be provided prior to the purchase for review. The customer should sign off on these documents once the procedures are performed as confirmation or approval. <br />4. Vendors will be responsible for any damage during installation and demonstration.<br />5. Improper installation or demonstration will not be approved by government and deliverables will not be accepted. Laboratory staff will inform to purchasing about the rejection and the purchasing department will handle the rejection process. The customer should review the checklists ahead of purchase to ensure that the procedures that will be provided/performed are acceptable. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</span></strong></p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the Sole/Single Source Justification that is attached to this Notice of Intent.</p>
<p>The Agilent 1260 Infinity Quaternary HPLC system is designed to minimize analysis time and maximize resolution for high quality analytical results. This system features a 600 bar standard pressure pump, 80 Hz standard detector speed, and up to 10 times higher UV detection sensitivity. The 1260 series is priced similar to the earlier 1200 series, allowing for enhanced ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) at a HPLC price. Additional advantages include:</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flexibility.</span> Higher flow rates of up to 5 mL/min at 600 bar operating pressure allow for the use of virtually any analytical column. The Agilent 1260 Infinity Quaternary HPLC pump allows the use of up to four different solvents to create binary, ternary, or quaternary gradients to ensure the purification of a wide range of compounds. The 190-950 nm multiple wavelength detector allows for the selection of any wavelength within this range to monitor compound response. Additional detectors, such as a radiodetector, fluorescence detector, or an ELSD detector can also be incorporated into the system.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upgradable.</span> Due to the stacking configuration of the Agilent 1260 HPLC components, each individual unit is capable of being replaced with a new unit and used with the existing components. This is true for injectors, autosamplers, detectors, pumps, and fraction collectors. The software platform, Chemstation, is also upgradable as subsequent versions become available to allow optimal communication between the instrument controller and the actual instrument.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ease of Operability.</span> All components feature front access and operation which is convenient for the user. Chemstation offers a wizard application that walks the user through each component (i.e., flow rate, timetable, injection volume, detector signals, etc.) when creating a new method. Agilent's website has a wealth of technical notes, eSeminars, and videos that aid the user with using, troubleshooting, and maintaining the instrumentation.</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safe.</span> The Agilent 1260 series HPLC has several leak detector sensors and pressure sensors to ensure operating conditions are in compliance within the instrument's acceptable range. If any of these sensors is triggered due to a solvent leak or excess pressure, the entire HPLC system will automatically shut down. This precautionary measure protects the user and instrument from potential hazards. Also, all solvent tubes and fittings are located in the front of the instrument panels to simplify adjustments in the event of a leak.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brand-name Determination: </span></p>
<p>In order to comply with years of results and protocols generated by the use of already existing Agilent HPLC systems, IPDC must purchase compatible units that will be able to work in conjunction with this new system. In order to minimize down time and lost research efforts, IPDC must purchase this additional Agilent system to adequately supply all IPDC staff with proper instrumentation to fully characterize synthesized compounds. Parts and accessories must be compatible with our current system. These systems are sold directly from Agilent and this company has extended discounted pricing in their quotation.</p>
<p>Agilent is the sole manufacturer of these machines. The parts are unique to these instruments and cannot be substituted by other vendor's parts. The engineers from Agilent have the in-depth knowledge and training to repair these complex machines.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLOSING STATEMENT</span></strong></p>

Transitioning to a new contractor during ongoing assessments, tracking study participants, and integration of multiple sources of data would substantially increase the burden on the study, the investigators, and participants. Thus, the current contractor has a well-defined knowledge of the functions and responsibilities required for this study, and possess a very important requisite which is; the qualified staff to continue performance without any impact or delay.

<DESC>NSN 7R-1660-011044400-AH, IAW REF NR 927575-1-3, QTY 4 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a
source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares:

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p><br />1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Human Systems Division (AFLCMC/WNU) is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to respond to the requirements listed in this document. AFLCMC is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to explore cost effective options to provide this capability. This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct<br />1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p><br />2. AFLCMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p><br />3. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. The acquisition strategy is still being determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply.</p>
<p><br />4. If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Large and small businesses should provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>5. Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace.</p>
<p><br />6. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />7. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.</p>

As the PLB will be operated in a nearly identical<br />manner as the existing beacon, the impact on the current curriculum and procedures is expected to be negligible. No increase in technician training is anticipated as the system is similar to currently fielded systems.<br />The system and its components must be compatible with current and planned Aircrew Flight<br />Equipment<br />System must be able to survive/operate in all anticipated threat environments, to include<br />chemical, biological, or radiological warfare environments. The system must be capable of being decontaminated to a safe level for reuse. The system must be operable by aircrew wearing CBRN gloves.<br />The support infrastructure for the PLB will be similar to the existing URT-33/URT-44 beacons.<br />The system will be highly portable using standard mobility storage containers and require a minimal forward logistics footprint. The system will use existing transportation processes, both military and commercial, to expedite shipment between operating locations and repair depots.<br />Fault diagnosis will be initiated through a Built-In-Test (BIT). BIT exercises all circuits and<br />transmits a test encoded message over the COSPAS-SARSAT system at 406MHz. The go/no- go results of the BIT will be indicated by an external light on the actual beacon. Removal, repair and replacement (antenna, battery, headphones, etc...) will be accomplished using common shop tools.<br />Technical orders (TOs), user manuals, and vendor documentation for integration/operation and<br />repair will include illustrated parts breakdowns, parts listings, and diagrams, theory of operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting guides. The Technical Manual supplied by the vendor will be used as a baseline for the development of a USAF Technical Order (TO).<br />Technical orders will be delivered in digital format and will be fully compatible with the Joint<br />Computer Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support System (JCALS)</p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">A one-day survey of over 108,000 school bus drivers reported 85,279 vehicles illegally passing stopped school buses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When this number is extrapolated to the school year, it is estimated at over 15 million violations each school year. Fortunately not all passing violations lead to crashes, and annually, the number of students killed is fewer than 10; however, the violations do create numerous close calls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although cameras are increasingly used to identify school bus stop arm bar violators, the effectiveness of such programs has not been addressed systematically. This project would identify a jurisdiction planning to install cameras to enforce illegal school bus passing laws and document the process to establish yielding rates before and after camera deployment to evaluate the effectiveness of the camera program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">The goal of this project is to determine if using stop arm camera enforcement reduces violations. The first steps of the project would be to identify localities planning to implement a stop arm bar camera program, gauge the community's interest in evaluating their program, and conduct observations in the community to quantify violations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is important to use a locality that already has legislation in place allowing the cameras and has made arrangements to begin camera installation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This demonstration project would also require that the selected jurisdiction plan to implement an education component to reiterate to drivers when they must stop for school buses and that cameras are being used to cite stop arm bar violators. In addition, if not already planned by the jurisdiction, the Contractor shall implement a training/education component for law enforcement officers and judges to increase awareness of how the cameras work and of the technology being deployed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government from an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is seeking companies with technical expertise and experience in the production and testing of Methyl Violet (MV) and Potassium Iodide (KI)/Starch test papers. The KI/starch and MV test papers are used to qualify various nitrate esters, gun propellants, etc. for military munitions/ordnance as per test methods described below. These are to be made using a formula and protocols similar to Analytical Methods for Powders and Explosives AB Bofor 1974 pp 45-7 or Franklin Research Institute Encyclopedia Vol. 8 P 118M. Applicable sections of MIL-STD-105 and 109 may apply. Testing of the finished papers for suitability of response will be conducted as per MIL-STD-286C method 404.1.2 for MV papers and MIL-N-246B paragraph 4.3.4 or MIL-N-244B paragraph 4.5.8 for KI papers. Additional testing of physical dimensions for in-process quality assurance is also required as the end item performance is not guaranteed by adherence to the manufacturing process. The Government anticipates the needed quantity (total) of 5,000 to 15,000 per year for these test papers.</p>
<p>Manufacturing of these test papers requires an extensive background in the production of test papers as their end performance is very much influenced by the manufacturing environment and specific lots of dyestuffs used in the case of the MV paper. Further, the proper performance testing of the papers requires access to liquid nitrate esters, (potentially dry nitrocellulose), several military propellants and the ability/facility to conduct the prescribed tests in a safe manner. These materials are extremely hazardous due to their explosive properties and must be handled in accordance to proper practices. Technical expertise to sustain quality throughout all phases of the manufacturing process and an established internal quality control system are also required.</p>
<p>All responding sources shall provide a summary of their company's capabilities including organization name, address, a description of facilities and/or equipment, manufacturing process, inspection capability, personnel, past experience, and current production capacity per month. Since ability to test these papers requires access to explosives and other energetic materials conform to local, state and federal laws, regulations and appropriate safety and security measures must be demonstrated. In order to be eligible for any award associated with explosive materials a contractor must have an approved Safety Survey per DCMA.</p>
<p>It is also required to provide a point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE Code. <br />All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 17 January 2014 to:</p>
<p>Frederick Heim<br />Naval Surface Warfare Center<br />Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division<br />Applied Analytical Laboratory<br />5326 Whitman Ct. Bldg 1864<br />Indian Head, MD 20640<br />(301) 744-1609</p>
<p>Responses can also be submitted by email to Frederick.heim@navy.mil. Large files need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com).</p>
<p>This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.</p>

PART III - Work Requirements

A.	TECHNICAL:  All hazardous wastes must be kept in an accumulation point, also known as a Satellite Accumulation Area (SAA), until a contractor is contacted for pick-up.  The contractor must properly identify each waste, which may include the need to sample and analyze any or all generated waste for waste characterization and determination.  Additionally, the contractor is required to properly segregate, identify, and store hazardous wastes in accumulation areas, as well as compliance with Federal, State and local requirements for accumulation areas.  
B.	This contract shall cover all RCRA hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste as determined by JAHVAH.  Normally, this includes waste generated by typical healthcare facility operations.  Although a specific waste disposal pricing list will be generated by the Contractor, additional wastes may be required to be included at a later time, as needed by JAHVAH.  An example of such waste streams may be the result of a new procedure, management practices, new equipment installed, expired chemicals, among others, at the JAHVAH facilities.  Therefore, this contract shall encompass the management and disposal of a comprehensive spectrum of waste streams, as required by JAHVAH.   It is anticipated that the waste streams may vary and change overtime.  This contract shall accommodate for these changes.

D.  INFORMATION SECURITY:
VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE
VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE:
a. Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
b. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
c. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
d. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.  
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.  
g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.  
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.  
i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements.  VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 
j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.  
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 
SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 
c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 
 (1)   Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);  
(2)   Description of the event, including:  
(a)  date of occurrence;             
(b)  data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;       (3)  Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;        
(4)  Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;  
(5)  Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;        
(6)  Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
 (7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);        
(8)  Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;        
(9)  Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;      
(10)  Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and      
(11)  Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 
 d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $__37.50__ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 
   (1)  Notification;     
   (2)  One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;     
   (3)  Data breach analysis;     
   (4)  Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;      
   (5)  One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and  
   (6)  Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 
SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING:
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-days' notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 
TRAINING:
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior Training.
(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Rules of Behavior. 
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

8.	The Contractor shall identify each treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) which may perform treatment, storage or disposal services under this contract. 
9.	Each facility must have, as a minimum, EPA RCRA interim status or state approval as a treatment or disposal facility and be in good standing with the regulatory community. 
10.	The contractor agrees that no facility other than those initially approved for use under this contract will be used, without first obtaining the written approval of the JAHVAH. 
11.	The appropriate permit/license number, name and address of the permitting/licensing agency shall be provided. 
12.	The TSDFs approved for use under this contract are only approved subject to all services being performed in accordance with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations and the TSDF's permit. 
13.	The contractor must have the capability to meet the removal and disposal timeframes required by Federal/State regulations and JAHVAH schedule requirements for all waste streams. 
14.	At least one interim storage facility for each waste stream shall be included in the proposal. 
15.	Treatment of hazardous waste (including solidification) on JAHVAH property is not permitted.  Treatment is defined as any process which meets the definition of treatment as set forth in applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations. 
U.  DISPOSAL SITES: The contractor shall use only licensed disposal sites, which shall be identified in the proposal, and agrees that sites other than these will not be used without obtaining prior written approval from the COR.  The universal pharmaceutical waste will be disposed by a licensed TSDF within the State of Florida (will not be shipped out of state).

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE
VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE:
a. Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
b. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
c. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
d. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.  
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.  
g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.  
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.  
i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements.  VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 
j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.  
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 
SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 
c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 
 (1)   Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);  
(2)   Description of the event, including:  
(a)  date of occurrence;             
(b)  data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;       (3)  Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;        
(4)  Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;  
(5)  Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;        
(6)  Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
 (7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);        
(8)  Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;        
(9)  Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;      
(10)  Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and      
(11)  Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 
 d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $__37.50__ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 
   (1)  Notification;     
   (2)  One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;     
   (3)  Data breach analysis;     
   (4)  Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;      
   (5)  One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and  
   (6)  Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SEEKING SMALL BUSINESSES (Please see attached document for details).
SOURCES SOUGHT:  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 Employees for an upcoming requirement for the USGS, Mineral and Environmental Resources Science Center, Denver, CO to provide a high-resolution multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICPMS).
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR.  Submission is voluntary.
This requirement is for a high-resolution multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) for high-precision measurements of the isotope ratios of elements in geological, hydrological, and biological materials (lithium to uranium).
1.	The MC-ICPMS shall use double focusing ion optics (i.e., both electrostatic and magnetic sectors) designed for high mass resolution and highly precise and accurate isotopic measurements of elements from lithium to uranium.
2.	The instrument shall have a multiple-collector array with discrete dynode multipliers for the ion-counting system, and either (a) movable Faraday detectors or (b) fixed Faraday detector positions and variable dispersion (Zoom) optics.  The collector array of the instrument shall be able to accommodate at least two full-sized discrete dynode multipliers, up to three additional ion counters (either full-sized or compact discrete dynode multipliers), and a minimum of one retardation filter to increase the abundance sensitivity.
3.	The instrument shall have high abundance sensitivity.  The abundance sensitivity, defined as the baseline at mass 237 with a large 238U signal (>410-11 A), shall be less than 3 ppm.  Abundance sensitivity for any ion-counting detectors fitted with a retardation filter shall be less than 500 ppb.

<DESC>This sources sought notice seeks information on the capability and availability of potential contractors to supply and install the below described product at the John Day Lock and Dam Project, Sherman County, Oregon. <br> This is a sources sought synopsis and is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute any commitment on the part of the government, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this notice. <br>  The purpose of this notice is to ascertain whether a product with the salient characteristics described below is available from only one source or supplier with unique capabilities.  The Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project.  <br> Response to this notice would not need to provide a product, but a solution, that would be an approved equal to the contemplated product described below.  The entirety of the scope described below is important.  Offerors providing only an aspect of the scope would need to team with a partner to provide a solution.   <br> Responses should come in the form of a cut sheet or white paper with sufficient detail to provide an equally effective and cost conscious alternative to the product/solution described below.  30 days are provided to supply a response. <br> Point of Contact for this notice is Jeffrey S. Renner, Contract Specialist, (503) 808-4630. <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District is seeking sources for a project to repair failed monolith joint waterstops at John Day Dam, on the Columbia River.  The project would involve drilling a near vertical 6 quote mark  diameter hole that straddles the monolith joint starting at the top deck of the dam and extending through the entire structure into the bedrock below and filling the drilled hole with  expanding grout to restore the waterstop.  The tolerance for deviation from vertical is 0.1 degree for the drilled hole.  At several times throughout the drilling process, the progress of the drilled hole will be checked to ensure the monolith joint is contained within the drilled area.  Where the drilled hole is near the top of dam, the hole will be monitored visually.  When a visual inspection of the drilled hole is no longer possible, the Contractor will be required to utilize a down-hole camera for inspection/monitoring purposes.  A permanent video record of the drilled hole will need to be provided to the Government as part of the project.  As part of the drilling activities, the driller will be expected to capture, remove, and dispose of all tailings, air, water, and dust created during drilling operations. <br> After completion of the drilled hole and verification that the monolith joint is contained within the hole for the entire length of the joint, the Contractor will insert an expanding grout into the hole to restore the waterstop.  Upon contact with water, the grout would begin to expand, eventually filling the entire void space of the hole.  Additionally, the product would need to be able to expand and contract yearly as the monoliths shrink and swell with temperature changes.  In order to insure that the entire drilled hole is filled, the product will need to be a solid product at the time it is placed into the hole.  This will provide a guarantee that the entire length of the drilled hole is completely filled with the waterstop product.  The product should be solid cylinders cut to a manageable length for installation.  The waterstop cylinders need to have the following physical and material properties: <br>  	Specific gravity above 1.04. <br>  	Expansion pressure between 250 and 450 psi at full depth. <br>  	Unrestrained expansion diameter of 1.5 times the original cylinder. <br>  	Service temperature range between 30 and 70 degrees F. <br>  	Durometer hardness shore A scale A30. <br>  	Less than 0.05 percent air entrainment. <br>  	Confined compression strength over 900 psi. <br>  	Cylinder diameter 5 inches with a 5% tolerance. <br> Additionally, the waterstop product manufacturer needs to have 5 years of experience performing waterstop remediation with 3 successful applications of the proposed approach at a depth that exceeds 100 feet below water.

Invitation for Offer - Federal Natural Gas Liquids IFO NO. BLM-2013-CHEU-001 January 2014 - December 2014
Introduction: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU). BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually. The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction unit. The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU. The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas. The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up via truck transport by the successful bidder of this agreement. Buyer shall be responsible for all transportation costs. The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 6- to 7-year life of this project. Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL. The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of New HIV Testing Technologies in Healthcare Settings Serving Populations at High Risk for HIV Infection

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes and to enhance study design.</p>
<p>The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), is considering the development of a new research project to evaluate new technologies for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening and diagnosis in the United States, and is seeking information relevant to the implementation of this project from healthcare settings serving a patient population with documented high prevalence of acute HIV infection.</p>
<p>Background<br />An estimated 50,000 new HIV infections are diagnosed each year in the United States. Men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young minority MSM, are estimated to have the highest incidence of new HIV infections. The first few weeks after HIV infection, referred to as the acute stage in this document, can be defined clinically as the stage when HIV infection can be detected by testing for HIV virus directly, but without a detectable HIV-specific antibody response. Identification of HIV infection in this acute stage serves a public health need since those with acute infection have large amounts of circulating HIV virus and thus have an increased risk of transmitting infection. Additionally, recent studies suggest that initiation of antiretroviral treatment before the infection affects the immune system confers both clinical and public health benefits. Although clinical sensitivity of tests for HIV antibodies appears to be improving, detection of HIV infection during the acute stage, by definition, requires the ability to detect virus directly rather than relying on detection of antibody. However, molecular tests for HIV have traditionally been complicated and expensive to perform, and although a variety of strategies to utilize these tests in clinical settings have been proposed, they are still not widely used. Several new HIV tests have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or their approval is imminent. Understanding the relative sensitivity of available HIV tests during the earliest stages of infection, including the acute stage and immediately after development of an antibody response, while also maximizing the number of persons with previously undiagnosed infection who are identified and linked to HIV medical care, will require an examination of new HIV testing technologies in high incidence populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>
<p>So that DHAP can monitor and update HIV testing guidance that reflects newly available testing technology and characterizes the relative performance of available tests, an evaluation must be conducted to understand the differences in analytic and clinical sensitivity of the newest HIV serologic (antibody) tests. In addition, there is a need to evaluate the diagnostic performance of nucleic acid (molecular) tests, to allow DHAP to determine the applicability of this technology for use in a variety of clinical and point-of-care settings.</p>
<p>Information Requested<br />CDC is considering several integrated study designs to facilitate the evaluation of new HIV serologic and molecular assays to screen for acute and prevalent HIV infection, and for use as supplemental tests in the HIV diagnostic testing algorithm that includes a 4th generation immunoassay, an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test and a nucleic acid test (the proposed CDC laboratory algorithm for HIV diagnosis). In order to evaluate the analytic sensitivity as a measure of the tests' ability to identify HIV infection during the acute stage, the tests must be evaluated in settings where the testing population has a high incidence of new HIV infection. We propose to evaluate the new testing technologies in 3-4 clinical sites serving MSM with documented high prevalence of HIV infections detected during the acute stage. However, in order to successfully evaluate these new technologies, including those still under investigation for FDA approval, the evaluation will also require that the clinical sites be able to perform real time evaluations of a variety of tests. To do so will require sites to have access to an onsite laboratory classified as moderate complexity under the Clinical laboratory Improvement Amendment managed by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Additionally, sites must have access to a laboratory that conducts an algorithm that includes a 4th generation immunoassay, an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test and a nucleic acid test, and be willing to run this algorithm on the entire study population. Finally, the site must have access to a quantitative viral load test for clinical staging of all study participants identified as HIV-infected, and be able to properly store and ship biologic materials to CDC frozen on dry ice. As part of the clinical follow-up, sites will be asked to draw additional blood specimens from participants, and should also have electronic data systems and data management capacity to collect and manage all HIV test results, demographics, behavioral risk data, information on previous HIV testing, and antiretroviral use both prior to diagnosis (e.g. for Pre or Post exposure prophylaxis) and after diagnosis (e.g. as part of a program for early initiation of HIV therapy). <br /><br />As proposed, testing could be conducted over two years on approximately 25,000 study participants, in order to identify a minimum of 500 persons with prevalent HIV infection (prevalence of at least 2%) and 50 persons with acute infections (prevalence of acute infection of at least 0.2%), for enrollment in clinical follow-up. A subset of HIV antibody negative patients will be recruited for serial follow-up visits so that seroconversion sensitivity can be assessed for all tests. They will receive a quantitative viral load test and be followed until one of the following occurs: they become positive on all HIV tests under evaluation, or they complete 9 visits up to 70 days after the initial visit. Participants enrolled in the follow-up study will receive a quantitative viral load after seroconversion with all HIV tests or at 70 days.</p>
<p>NCHHSTP and DHAP requests your input on some or all of the following items regarding the design of an evaluation of new HIV testing technologies:</p>
<p>1. Please comment on the approach described above, including the design and feasibility. What are the most important scientific questions that this study should answer? What, if any, critical elements are missing from the proposed study design? Please describe what elements should be considered if any are missing.</p>
<p>2. The ideal clinical site would be able to: conduct a sufficient volume of HIV screening tests (~4,000 tests/year of previously undiagnosed, high-risk MSM populations), have a high incidence of acute infections (at least 2/1000), have the ability to screen with a large number of screening tests, have a CLIA moderate complexity laboratory, be able to conduct the CDC laboratory algorithm on all study participants, receive laboratory results in a timely manner to facilitate enrollment in longitudinal follow-up for those identified in the acute stage, and have the ability to collect required data. How many individual sites do you think might be needed to meet all these criteria? What aspects of this plan would be difficult or impossible for your site to implement? What changes to current procedures/facilities/clinic flow would need to be in place in order for your site to do this work? How might you meet the study objectives in a way that is compatible with your site's capabilities to conduct a clinical research study? What resources would be required to implement this study?</p>
<p>3. In addition to the clinical information being collected (e.g., all HIV test results, prior testing history, HIV viral load at diagnosis and 70 days of follow-up, documentation of linkage to HIV care after diagnosis), what behavioral risk information should be collected from all participants? What types of information should be collected both from acutely infected individuals enrolled in follow-up as well as a (perhaps matched) subset of those individuals identified with prevalent HIV infection? What types of behavioral risk information do you already collect? Can/How would you modify your current information collection procedures to accommodate the collection of additional behavioral information? What additional resources would be required provide these data to CDC?<br /><br />4. How feasible, or not feasible, would it be for clinical sites conducting the volume of HIV testing outlined in #2 to screen all consenting participants (who presumably came to the test site seeking one HIV test) with a large number (5-7) of new HIV tests? What alternatives to this approach might facilitate the evaluation of a variety of HIV tests in a high-risk population? For example, would newly diagnosed, HIV-infected individuals be willing to enroll in a study in which all tests under evaluation were performed at multiple sequential time points? Or, would a clinical site be able to conduct a brief behavioral screening questionnaire on all individuals seeking testing in order to test only the highest risk subset with the new, more sensitive, but more complicated molecular tests? How would you recommend that DHAP operationalize the process of running many HIV screening tests on a large number of patients who sought HIV testing in your clinic?</p>
<p>5. Biospecimens, including blood, oral fluid, and dried-blood spots, collected from study participants during both screening and follow-up would be processed locally, and stored either at the clinical site or their partner laboratory, prior to shipment to the CDC repository. Please comment on this approach, including:<br />a) the feasibility of having clinical sites collect, process and store specimens locally<br />i. What additional resources (e.g. a biospecimen freezer for storage, an additional centrifuge for specimen processing) might be required in order for your site to accomplish this goal?<br />b) the likelihood of newly diagnosed, HIV-infected individuals consenting to serial follow-up, specimen collection and storage for future testing<br />c) any recommendations for recruitment and retention of such individuals in this phase of the study</p>
<p>6. Please provide any additional information pertinent to the proposed project that we should consider.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, proposes to enter into a sole source contract with the National Council On Aging,1901 L Street N.W. 4th Floor Washington, DC 20036 in accordance with FAR 13.501(a)<br />(1)(ii) under the Commercial Items Test Program for commercial items under section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 or the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 USC 428a {41 USC 1903 and 1904) for financial analysis and benefits assistance access tools that are tailored to the unique needs of seniors considering a reverse mortgage, and housing counselors that are providing those seniors statutorily mandated housing counseling in conjunction with an FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). These tools must reflect not only an expert knowledge of the complexities of a reverse mortgage, the HECM program and the required counseling services, but also a comprehensive and current database of public and other assistance programs that could benefit seniors.<br />The National Council of Aging is the only source that can provide the Financial Analysis Tool (FIT) and Benefits Checkup (BCU to that are proprietary system. The National Council on Aging developed the two system that help counsel complete a customized budge to illustrate a household's current financial situation and to determine how a reverse mortgage might or might not help in meeting their needs-goal and educate potential borrower regarding public and other benefits program that may assist them. The tool must provide a summary of these factors, which can help housing counselors identify the features of a reverse mortgage that may be appropriate to meet client goals, assess the impact of their financial needs on remaining equity over time and consider alternative options to a reverse. Through a few key questions, the tool must facilitate conversations with counseling clients about life factors such as declining health, limitations in the home environment, or recent life transitions such as widowhood that can make it hard for them to stay at home mortgage<br />Moreover, a tool is required so that housing counselors can quickly screen more than 1,800 public and private benefits programs from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. These benefit programs include tax relief, energy assistance, health care and in-home services, prescription drugs, nutrition programs, housing, and programs for which a senior may be eligible, and provide contact information to help them apply for these benefits. The tool must prepare a report identifying public and private benefits programs for the senior to consider. This report must also include program details such as program descriptions, application forms, local contact information that answers questions and helps with enrollment, and a listing of necessary documentation to aid in the application process. Many homeowners consider a reverse mortgage to help pay for homeowner expenses, health care and other basic needs. For those with limited incomes, benefits from existing federal, state and local programs could be an important alternative or supplement to a reverse mortgage. Moreover, this type of tool is required to assist HECM borrowers who struggle to meet the terms and conditions of the HECM loan, for example the many borrowers who are delinquent on their taxes and insurance. This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Response must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide service outline above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 5 calendar days, December 18, 2013, 4:00 p.m. EST, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable supplies and service are available and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award shall be sent Geneva.D.Maphis@hud.gov.<br />

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medical (USARIEM) intends to negotiate solely (as prescribed in FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i)) with SCANCO USA, Inc., P.O. Box 646, Southeastern, PA 19399, for the procurement of a Xtreme Computed Tomography (CT) System.  Specifically, the government will purchase the following items for the Bone Health Lab and Body Composition Laboratory: <br> 		 <br> XtremeCT II System (RDK062513JH), qty: 1 <br>  <br> This system is required due to the fact it is a high resolution scanner used to measure bone mineral density of the forearm and lower leg and assess the geometry, strength and microstructure of bone in three dimensions.  Capabilities of this system include:  1) Low radiation x-ray scanning (Less than 1/20th the radiation of a single chest x-ray); 2) Distinct separation of compact and spongy bone; 3) Evaluation of trabecular elements-the smallest elements that make bones strong; 4) 3-dimensional analysis of the structure of bone which determines its resistance to fracture; and 5) Built-in finite element analysis which allows for determination of bone's resistance to bending with loading.  These capabilities stem from the resolution of the images that are captured with the XtremeCT II ( less than 80 m).  No other bone scanners are produced that have these capabilities because other scanners have a resolution that is over 500 times lower than the XtremCT II.  Scanco is the only company in this market sector with this unique bone scanning capability and reflects the best value to the Government. <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees. <br>  <br> This announcement constitutes the notice required by FAR 5.201.  Interested persons may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, proposal or quotation to the point of contact listed below prior to December 27, 2013.  This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.  A written solicitation, W81XWH-14-R-0010 will be issued no earlier than December 28, 2013 which will serve as the request for competitive quotes.  All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to CPT Georgeana Green at georgeana.l.green.mil@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the above e-mail address or by mail to the address listed below no later than 3:00 pm EST, Friday, December 27, 2013.  <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, ATTN: MCMR-AAA, 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014  <br>  <br> Point of Contact:  <br> CPT Georgeana Green

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command-Redstone and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) located in Huntsville, Alabama, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) (Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B)), intends to execute without competition a bilateral contract modification under contract W9113M-09-D-0001 (sole source, Modification P00015) to Johns Hopkins University Applied Research Laboratory (JHU/APL) to to provide an eight (8) month extension to the ordering period (see details below).  The address for this organization is 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723-6099; Cage Code 88898.  <br>  <br> A provision of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, as codified by 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(3)(B), authorizes non competitive contracts with educational institutions where necessary to establish or maintain essential engineering, research, and/or development capabilities. JHU is an approved University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) as authorized by the above statute and referenced in Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) UARC management plan dated July 2010 and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEASYSCOM) ltr 5450 Ser 106/08-002 dated 30 October 2007.  The JHU, as a UARC, may not compete against industry in response to competitive Requests for Proposal (RFPs) for development or production that involve engineering expertise developed or sustained through this contract action in accordance with statute 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B).  This acquisition may receive a combination of both competitive and non-competitive funding from various Department of Defense (DoD) agencies under the authority previously cited.  <br>  <br> JHU possesses an extensive breadth of capabilities and has been involved in broad programs of long term research and development of major DoD systems.  The scope of the tasks performed under this contract extend across several areas of science and technology to include many different warfare elements, and involve various types of activities from basic research, development, test and evaluation, systems innovations, integration and engineering in support of the DoD's warfighting capabilities.  No other known source can provide these services to maintain active research and development capabilities essential to various USASMDC/ARSTRAT and other Government missions without disrupting the support to existing technology development efforts or negatively impacting the readiness of systems under development. <br>  <br> The primary purpose of this notice is to publicize this contract action prior to contract modification, as mandated in FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and FAR Subpart 6.3 (Other Than Full and Open Competition).  The contract type will remain Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and the period of performance will be extended from 21 February 2014 to 31 October 2014.  <br>  <br> This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal.

(End of provision) 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks &ldquo;have&rdquo;, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and (D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."<br />"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.<br />"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see Subpart 32.11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) for the same parent concern.<br />"Registered in the CCR database" means that--<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database;<br />(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the CCR database; and<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service, and has marked the records ``Active.'' The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as part of the CCR registration process.<br />(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. <br />(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. <br />(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. <br />(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- <br />(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or <br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. <br />(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: <br />(i) Company legal business. <br />(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. <br />(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. <br />(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). <br />(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.204-7006 BILLING INSTRUCTIONS (OCT 2005)<br />When submitting a request for payment, the Contractor shall--<br />(a) Identify the contract line item(s) on the payment request that reasonably reflect contract work performance; and<br />(b) Separately identify a payment amount for each contract line item included in the payment request.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.<br />(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.<br />(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds to, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to--<br />(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);<br />(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);<br />(3) The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.);<br />(4) The Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730-774);<br />(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120-130); and<br />(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.<br />(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories will be established approximately May 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $5,126,544.75. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. One hundred and ten product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of those one hundred and ten product groups, forty represent clinically significant product groups, are required for the QSL, and account for 76.46% ($3,919,556.13) of the total volume in sales ($5,126,544.75). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />IV Gravity Tubing and Accessories requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide Cage Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a Cage Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account, will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.<br />5. Vendor MUST provide the following items. Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, and Number of eaches in Unit of Sale.

The proposal must clearly identify the individual who will perform the work outlined in the statement of work. This individual's resume must show extensive knowledge of art, managing art programs in a research hospital, and the contractor's performance of similar tasks in previous contract efforts.

In doing so, OCR helps carry out HHS' overall mission of improving the health and well-being of all people affected by its many programs and promotes integrity in the use of federal funds by removing discriminatory barriers to HHS funded services and programs. OCR annually resolves more than 10,000 citizen complaints alleging discrimination or a health information privacy or security violation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal. Please reference solicitation number HSTS07-14 -R-00007 on all correspondence.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued as Total Small Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 611699.</p>
<p>This combined solicitation/synopsis is for the purchase of range services on an established/existing range in accordance with the following requirements. <br /><br />Services anticipated January 21, 2014,</p>
<p>Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires an established/existing shooting range within a fifteen (15) mile radius of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport (DFW). This is NOT a request to build a range. The range shall be required to provide a minimum of twelve (12) simultaneous firing points, a minimum of eight (8) days per month. The range may be either outdoor or indoor but shall meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>The outdoor range must be covered or available for all weather use and have proper drainage controls as well as a safe usable all weather surface during rainy conditions, (i.e. pea gravel, blacktop, concrete).</p>
<p>The indoor range must possess a ventilation system that conforms to exiting OSHA standards</p>
<p>Whether outdoor or indoor the range must meet the following criteria:<br />&bull; Must allow for target placement a minimum distance of 1.5 feet from the firing line, and a maximum distance of 75 feet from the firing line.<br />&bull; Must have distinct firing line indicators (i.e. concrete or blacktop sidewalks for outdoor, firing line for indoor).<br />&bull; All covering supports, barricades or barricade holders on the range shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect/ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it (Example: wood).<br />&bull; Must possess or provide target base stands that are compatible with 1"x2" fir strips to hold fixed targets.<br />&bull; Range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster or students turning and then drawing and firing from the holster.<br />&bull; Range rules cannot disallow students from multiple and rapid-fire drills.<br />&bull; Range rules cannot disallow a student from firing and moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e. tactical movement and shooting drills).</p>
<p>In addition to the range requirements above, the facility must have the following within close proximity (walking distance) to the firing range.</p>
<p>&bull; Firearms cleaning area<br />&bull; 240 square feet of secure storage that can be provided on-site for safeguarding of targets, ammunition, and other training devices and equipment<br />&bull; Parking available on site for a minimum of 24 vehicles at one time<br />&bull; Equipped with separate male and female washroom/restroom facilities<br />&bull; It is desirable, but not required, to have a classroom or break room to accommodate a minimum of 24 students<br />&bull; Firing range area in use by the Government must be closed or limited from view form the public during the corresponding hours of use</p>
<p>A bullet trap shall exist on the range. The range owner will be responsible for lead recovery at the range. It is estimated that each student will fire approximately 500 rounds per session. The estimated number of rounds fired per month is 192,000 (based on 48 shooters X 500 rounds X 8 days).</p>
<p>TSA personnel or its contractors will use the range an average of 24 days per quarter (8 days X 12 months = 96 days per year/4 quarters) with a maximum of 48 shooters per day; however, the Government shall have the right to increase/decrease this number without being subject to price changes. Under this contract, TSA requires exclusive use of the range in 4 or 8 hour blocks from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. This does not include Federal holidays.</p>
<p>TSA will provide all ammunition, targets and firearms instructors. The range time must be available exclusively to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel during the hours indicated. The need for range services is anticipated to begin on or about January 21, 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor is reminded that in accordance with subparagraph (q) of FAR clause 52.212-4, "Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items," the contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract for range services.</p>
<p>Proposed Site Inspection</p>
<p>As part of the proposal evaluation process, TSA reserves the right to inspect all proposed sites to ensure compliance with all requirements set forth above.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be for (1) base year and (4) four one-year options. The solicitation incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if given in full text. Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov/far.

The proposals will be evaluated using the factors as follows:<br />(a) Technical Factors<br />(1) Qualification Statement.

The Government reserves the right not to award a contract in response to this solicitation if it determines that none of the offers received provide the best value to the Government. In such a case, the Government will not be liable for any bid or proposal costs. Award may be made only to a contractor who has registered with the System for Award Management at https://www.sam.gov (formally ccr) prior to contract award. Additionally, offerors are advised that the following clause will pertain to any contract award: Release of Information: The Contractor shall not disclose, advertise, or release information about this contract to any individual or organization without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer.<br />Price Factors<br />Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options.

<p>The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order and may award without discussions.

Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

(End of Clause)
C.8  IT CONTRACT SECURITY
    VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY
  1.  GENERAL
  Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
  2.  ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
  a.  A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
  b.  All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
  c.  Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
  d.  Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
  e.  The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
  3.  VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
  a.  Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
  b.  VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met.  If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
  c.  Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/ subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/ created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA.  Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
  d.  The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
  e.  The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
  f.  If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
  g.  If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
  h.  The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
  i.  The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements.  VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
  j.  Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
  k.  Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
  l.  For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR.
  4.  INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
  a.  Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems.  This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA Handbook 6500, VA Information Security Program).  During the development cycle a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must be completed, provided to the COR, and approved by the VA Privacy Service in accordance with Directive 6507, VA Privacy Impact Assessment.

  d.  Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.
  e.  The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program and VA Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle.
  f.  The contractor/subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and applicable agency regulations.  Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties.
  g.  The contractor/subcontractor agrees to:
    (1)   Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies:
      (a)  The Systems of Records (SOR); and
      (b)  The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/ subcontractor is to perform;
        (1)   Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and
        (2)   Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR.
  h.  In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function.  For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.
    (1)   "Operation of a System of Records" means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records.
    (2)   "Record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person's name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.
    (3)   "System of Records" means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.
  i.  The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as "Systems"), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods.  This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware.  The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.
  j.  The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system).  Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than 1 days.
  k.  When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days.  When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within 10 days.
  l.  All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure.  Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.
  5.  INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
  a.  For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks.  This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system.  The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems.  A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval.  All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
  b.  Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA.  These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
  c.  Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office.  Government- owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
  d.  The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA.  Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process.  The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities.  Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government.  Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General.  The physical security aspects associated with contractor/ subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments.  If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re- authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3.  This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan).  The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
  e.  The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required.  Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COR.  The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor.  The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
  f.  VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/ subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA's network.  If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract.  All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment.  All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration.  Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches.  Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
  g.  All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon:  (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/ subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements.  This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
  h.  Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes.  The options are:
    (1)   Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
    (2)   VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
    (3)   VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
    (4)   Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
      (a)   The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
      (b)   Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation.  Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
      (c)   A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.  The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
  6.  SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
  a.  The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/ subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/ subcontractor has access.
  b.  To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/ subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
  c.  With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information.  Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
  d.  In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement.  The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.  The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
  7.  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
  a.  Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.  If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
  b.  The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach.  The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
  c.  Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
    (1)   Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
    (2)   Description of the event, including:
      (a)  date of occurrence;
      (b)  data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
    (3)  Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
    (4)  Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
    (5)  Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
    (6)  Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
    (7)  The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
    (8)  Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
    (9)  Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
    (10)  Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
    (11)  Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
  d.  Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $3,745.00 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
   (1)  Notification;
   (2)  One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
   (3)  Data breach analysis;
   (4)  Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
   (5)  One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
   (6)  Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
  8.  SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
  On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General.  The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.
  9.  TRAINING
  a.  All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
    (1)   Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
    (2)   Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
    (3)   Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
    (4)   Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
  b.  The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
  c.  Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. The 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW) is requesting information and conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources which have the capability to provide security services at the 505 CCW and its subordinate units. This announcement closes 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, 6 Jan 2014. The Government is seeking industry input from all sources (small and large businesses) at this time. Small Business concerns are highly encouraged to respond to this request in order for the Government to determine if this acquisition should be a total small business set aside under the auspices of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 561621 (Alarm System Monitoring Services) with a corresponding size standard of $19M. Interested parties must be registered under NAICS 561621 in SAM (System for Award Management) at www.sam.gov, formerly known as CCR (Central Contractor Registration). The Government plans to consider all information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice.<br />&nbsp;
<p>FAR 52.215-3: (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is for planning and market research purposes only and should not be considered as a request for proposals or as a solicitation to do business with the Government.</p>
<p>Air Combat Command, Acquisition Management Integration Center (ACC AMIC) PKBC-OL (505 CCW/PK), Hurlburt Field, FL, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain non-personal services to support Wing and subordinate units to ensure the protection and safeguarding of Collateral, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Special Technical Operations (STO) and Special Access Programs (SAP) activities in the following core security mission areas: Security Management, Personnel Security, Information Security, Physical Security, Information Systems Security/Information Assurance (IA), Communications Security (COMSEC), Security Awareness, Training and Education (SATE), Operation Security (OPSEC), Industrial Security, Foreign Disclosure, SAP Systems Administration, and security courseware development and academic instruction.</p>
<p>Performance will consist of a Phase-In/Transition period (length of Phase-In period is TBD), one (1) base period, and four (4) one-year option periods. The Government anticipates making award on or about 30 Jun 2014, with the Phase-In/Transition period covering 26 Aug - 25 Sep 2014, and the actual contract performance to start 26 Sep 2014. The Request For Proposal (RFP) release date is to be determined. Please note: This is an estimated posting timeframe and it is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fbo.gov for all subsequent postings. A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is posted in conjunction with this notice to provide the size, scope, and complexity of this requirement. <br /><br />The predecessor Security Support contract was not a small business set aside. The Government is seeking industry input to determine if there are adequate small business concerns that are capable of performing the follow-on requirement. A determination regarding the set aside status for this effort has not been made.<br /><br />This is not a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and no contract will result from this notice, nor does it commit the Government to any acquisition for these services. All interested parties should submit a capabilities package (please limit to no more than 25 pages total) outlining your company's key business abilities relevant to the performance of this requirement and addressing the questions found in Attachment 1. Please submit the requested information to Capt Brooke Cultra at brooke.cultra@hurlburt.af.mil and Mr. Eric Lingad at eric.lingad@hurlburt.af.mil NLT 4:00 p.m. CST, Monday, 6 Jan 2014.</p>

<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/><br/>****NOTICE:  THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REVISED AS FOLLOWS****<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing M153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) systems and spare parts, recapitalization/reset/overhaul of previously delivered M153 CROWS systems, and CROWS engineering and logistics support.  The total contract value is estimated at $970M. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The U.S. Government intends to satisfy the above CROWS requirements through a Firm Fixed Price, Full and Open Competition, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), single award contract.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW will include:<br/><br/>I. Production of CROWS (total quantity estimated at 3,000 systems) and spare parts.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 50 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 150 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Product improvements, integrations, and testing.   <br/><br/>III.    Training, overhaul, depot-level, field maintenance support, recapitalization/reset of CROWS, and general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification includes the performance requirements and technical drawings.  The detail specification states the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and how the components are to be fabricated or constructed.  The detail specification does not include technical drawings and assembly procedures for some sub-assemblies, which are to be made by qualified directed sources at least until the First Article Testing phase.  This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between the new CROWS producer and commonality/interchangeability with existing CROWS systems.  The U.S. Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation: <br/> <br/> - Detail Specification<br/> - Performance requirements<br/> - Technical Drawings<br/> - Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/> - Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/> - Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/> - Assembly procedures<br/> - List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/> - Quality requirements <br/> - Test requirements<br/> - Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be released nor will prospective contractors have access to it at any time. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the U.S. Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be addressed through a software change process between the U.S. Government and the prospective Contractor. <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be provided upon request after the Request for Proposals release provided that all prerequisite paper work (described below) is properly completed, submitted, and approved.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement<br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  All other foreign companies shall be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements.  The countries of Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway are exempt from ITAR restrictions in accordance with 22 CFR 125.4(c) for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and solicitation; however these countries shall be ITAR compliant before a contract award.  This exemption will terminate on 25 August 2012.  All other countries shall obtain the appropriate licenses from the Department of State directly.  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and obtain the proper authorizations, which we encourage to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  Foreign vendors and contractors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for Contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR.  Contractors may consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and may consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions they may have relating to compliance with the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).  Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up M153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. The U.S. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the M153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The current schedule projects a Pre-Solicitation Conference at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on 6 October 2011 and a solicitation release in November/December 2011.  Only contractors who have pre-registered for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will be admitted.  Please reference the Pre Solicitation Conference Requirements notice posted on 1 July 2011.<br/><br/>All responses to this notice shall be in writing in the English language and at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>In the best interest of the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government intends to
change the previously stated contract type in DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015 from
Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) to base with options.  The base 
with options contract type has been determined to be more favorable to the 
U.S. Government. The expected contract duration remains unchanged at five (5)
years and is intended to be a single award.

The Royalty Fee, if applicable, as referenced in DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015 shall 
be added to an Offerors proposal in the total price evaluation as per FAR 
27.202-2 and stated in both Sections L & M of DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015. The 
royalty fee payments shall be paid by the U.S. Government in accordance with 
the Special License Agreement. The contract awardee is not required to pay the
royalty fee.

<NTYPE>SNOTE

<DESC>Expiration Date:  June 30, 2014
Invitation for Offer - Federal Crude Conservation Helium IFO NO. BLM-2014-OMCHS-001 January 2014 - June 2014
Introduction: The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 (HSA), 50 U.S.C.  167-167q, was enacted on October 2, 2013. The purpose of this Invitation for Offer (IFO) is to implement 167d(a) of the HSA, Phase A: Allocation Transition, which applies beginning October 2, 2013, and ending on September 30, 2014; and during any period which the sale of helium under 50 U.S.C.  167d(b), Phase B: Auction implementation, is delayed or suspended.  During Phase A, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) shall offer crude helium for sale in such quantities, at such times, at not less than the minimum prices established under  167d(b)(7), and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out Phase A with minimum market disruption.  In order to minimize market disruption, the BLM has determined to offer for sale a portion of the Federal Helium Reserve stored in the Cliffside Field, north of Amarillo Texas. 
Phase A sales will be conducted in a manner intended to minimize market disruptions including, pure helium market disruptions for end users; shortages of crude helium to pure helium refiners; or an oversupply of crude helium on the market for crude helium extractors.  
The volume of helium available for this sale is 400 million cubic feet (MMcf) at a price of $95 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) at 14.65 psi and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 
For more details and all documentation required to be sent with offer please see Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Amarillo Field Office's website at  http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/fo/Amarillo_Field_Office.html

1)  The due date for industry capability statements has been extended from December 20, 2013 to January 3, 2014.  All capability statements shall be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address:  jodi.gordon@emcbc.doe.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Friday, January 3, 2014.
2)  All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen pages (specific to company or team capabilities) plus an additional five pages to discuss potential acquisition strategy alternatives as requested in questions 1-3 of the RFI (division and/or aggregation of scope element(s) or potential contracting alternatives; challenges and risks; fixed price contract structure; etc.).  The total capability statement submitted should therefore be no more than a total of 20 pages, including no smaller than 12 point font.  
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  No solicitation is available. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is currently in the acquisition planning phase for potential upcoming EM procurement(s) at the Idaho Site post Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.  Since its inception in 1949, the Idaho Site has fulfilled numerous DOE missions including designing and testing nuclear reactors; reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recover fissile materials; managing spent nuclear fuel; and storing, treating and disposing of various waste streams.  Currently, the Office of EM acts in the role of tenant on the site, while the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE) serves as the landlord.  The mission of the Office of EM is to complete the safe cleanup of the environmental legacy brought about from five decades of nuclear weapons development and government-sponsored nuclear energy research. 
In May 2002, the DOE, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency signed a letter of intent formalizing an agreement to pursue accelerated risk reduction and cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to achieve the following vision: "By 2012, the INL will have achieved significant risk reduction and will have placed materials in safe storage ready for disposal." While this goal has been achieved, there are still risk reduction and mission critical environmental management activities that need to be completed.  
As previously announced, the DOE plans to conduct an Industry Day on Wednesday, December 4, 2013, in support of the upcoming EM procurement(s) at the Idaho Site post FY 2015.  Details of this previous announcement were posted on November 15, 2013 as a Special Notice to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at:
https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=feb19fc17e2864d408e8f4a9a34f38f3&tab=core&_cview=0
The DOE EM Consolidated Business Center (CBC) also created a procurement website where additional information will be provided which may be viewed here (as referenced on FBO):  
http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/IDAHO%20SITE%20POST%20FY%202015/index.php	
The purpose of this RFI is to solicit interested parties' input with the specialized capabilities necessary to meet all or part of the requirements of the Elements of Scope for efforts at the Idaho Site post FY 2015.  Information provided at the Industry Day and on the EMCBC website is provided for industry's assistance in preparation of Contractors? capability statements.  The information on the EMCBC website will be updated as it becomes available; therefore, Contractors should monitor the EMCBC website for additional information.  Within these capability statements, DOE is seeking feedback from contractors and other interested parties regarding options for innovative approaches for the performance of scope elements as well as insight into potential contracting alternatives to achieve the EM goals at the Idaho site post FY 2015.  
Due to the preliminary stage of this planning activity, there is no Performance Work Statement available at this time.  The anticipated number of procurement(s), types of contract(s), periods of performance, amount of funding, or set aside possibilities are to be determined. The contemplated procurement(s) will incorporate remaining EM work scope following completion of the current Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) and the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) contracts.  The major Elements of Scope include, but are not limited to:
- Spent Nuclear Fuel - Solid Waste Management - Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) - Environmental Activities - Site Infrastructure (EM Areas only) - Calcine Disposition Project
DOE is also seeking interested parties with specialized capabilities necessary to successfully perform all or a portion of the Elements of Scope defined above to further determine whether or not all or a portion of the work can be set-aside for small businesses, 8(a), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB), women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.

Capability Statements should include the following information as appropriate and applicable:  
1.) Describe your ability and approach to meeting all or a portion of the requirements for the specific Elements of Scope, including innovative approaches for the division or aggregation of scope elements as well as insight into contracting alternatives (number of procurement(s), types of contract(s), periods of performance, set aside possibilities, etc.) to achieve the EM goals at the Idaho site post FY 2015.
2.) Identify any performance challenges and risks in meeting the requirements discussed in the Elements of Scope.  Identify how your organization would minimize any risks such that there is reasonable assurance of successful performance.  Also identify how a specific division and/or aggregation of scope element(s) or potential contracting alternatives could be utilized to minimize such risks.
3.) Identify potential areas within any Element of Scope that may be appropriate for a fixed price contract structure along with any associated pricing challenges and risks.  Provide specific feedback for type of information required from DOE to support development of a fixed price proposal for any Elements of Scope.    4.) Describe your experience in a complex regulatory environment in respect to problem-solving, working with various stakeholders, tribal governments, Citizens Advisory Boards, and regulatory agencies at the state and federal level. 
5.) Discuss your experience as a DOE Prime contractor.  Include a description of the work scope, contract value, contract type, period of performance and lessons learned.
6.) This work will be conducted throughout multiple complexes and facilities within the Idaho site and will require interface with the Management and Operating (M&O) contractor.  Discuss your experience regarding such interfaces.  Providing examples of previous experience, describe your company or teaming arrangement?s experience in managing and integrating all of the work similar to specific Elements of Scope included in your Capability Statement, including the continuing infrastructure activities (e.g. janitorial and grounds keeping services; operations, utilities, and maintenance of facilities) under a single contract.  Also describe your experience in managing and integrating the work of subcontractors who would perform specialty functions or subcontractor employees working within the site'sorganizational matrix.
7.) Discuss your experience in implementation of environmental, safety and health plans related to your (and any teaming partners) work on DOE sites with large industrial and nuclear facilities.  This discussion should address your approach to addressing requirements under 10 CFR 830 and 10 CFR 835 related to Nuclear Safety, Quality, and Occupational Radiological Protection; 10 CFR 851 Worker Safety and Health; Work Control Program, NQA-1 and ISMS.
8.) Discuss your project management/project control system you would utilize for any resultant procurement supporting the Idaho Site post FY 2015, including information on the project control system you currently utilize for your company and how it will be tailored for any resultant procurement. 
9.) The contractor may be required to participate in the multi- employer pension and welfare benefits plans for the existing workforce covered by such plans while performing the requirements of any resultant procurement supporting the Idaho Site post FY 2015.  Discuss your experience (or that of any teaming partners) in sponsoring employer pension and benefit plans at DOE sites. 
10.) Brief Experience and Performance Record (past five years).  Identify all DOE, other Government, or other commercial experience relevant to this RFI (include contract number, date, scope, duration, client, and contracting agency contact).
Small business teams or joint ventures shall identify the socio-economic status of each member and shall provide a description of the work that each member would perform under a contract.  
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen pages (specific to company or team capabilities) plus an additional five pages to discuss potential acquisition strategy alternatives as requested in questions 1-3 of the RFI (division and/or aggregation of scope element(s) or potential contracting alternatives; challenges and risks; fixed price contract structure; etc.).  The total capability statement submitted should therefore be no more than a total of 20 pages, including no smaller than 12 point font.  The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party?s demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience and past performance in each of the scope areas specified to their area of expertise. 
All Interested parties are requested to provide their name of firm, point of contact, phone number, address of firm, CAGE Code, and/or a DUNS Number.
DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation.  An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response.  However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked, and sufficient justification provided as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.  DOE will review said information and safeguard it appropriately.
DOE will not respond to or post on the EMCBC website, any verbal or written questions or comments pertaining to this RFI package.  
The Government will not reimburse preparation costs nor otherwise provide compensation for any information that is provided in response to this announcement.  All capability statements shall be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address:  jodi.gordon@emcbc.doe.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Friday, January 3, 2014.  All questions pertaining to the announcement should be directed to Ms. LeAnn Brock at leann.brock@emcbc.doe.gov and/or telephone (513) 246-0563.  DOE personnel may contact firms responding to this announcement to clarify a responder?s capabilities and other matters as part of this market research process.

<DESC>This sources sought notice seeks information on the capability and availability of potential contractors to supply and install the below described product at the John Day Lock and Dam Project, Sherman County, Oregon.  <br>  This is a sources sought synopsis and is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute any commitment on the part of the government, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this notice.  <br>   The purpose of this notice is to ascertain whether a product with the salient characteristics described below is available from only one source or supplier with unique capabilities.  The Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project.   <br>  Response to this notice would not need to provide a product, but a solution, that would be an approved equal to the contemplated product described below.  The entirety of the scope described below is important.  Offerors providing only an aspect of the scope would need to team with a partner to provide a solution.    <br>  Responses should come in the form of a cut sheet or white paper with sufficient detail to provide an equally effective and cost conscious alternative to the product/solution described below.  30 days are provided to supply a response.  <br>  Point of Contact for this notice is Jeffrey S. Renner, Contract Specialist, (503) 808-4630.  <br>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District is seeking sources for a project to repair failed monolith joint waterstops at John Day Dam, on the Columbia River.  The project would involve drilling a near vertical 6 quote mark  diameter hole that straddles the monolith joint starting at the top deck of the dam and extending through the entire structure into the bedrock below and filling the drilled hole with  expanding grout to restore the waterstop.  The tolerance for deviation from vertical is 0.1 degree for the drilled hole.  At several times throughout the drilling process, the progress of the drilled hole will be checked to ensure the monolith joint is contained within the drilled area.  Where the drilled hole is near the top of dam, the hole will be monitored visually.  When a visual inspection of the drilled hole is no longer possible, the Contractor will be required to utilize a down-hole camera for inspection/monitoring purposes.  A permanent video record of the drilled hole will need to be provided to the Government as part of the project.  As part of the drilling activities, the driller will be expected to capture, remove, and dispose of all tailings, air, water, and dust created during drilling operations.  <br>  After completion of the drilled hole and verification that the monolith joint is contained within the hole for the entire length of the joint, the Contractor will insert an expanding grout into the hole to restore the waterstop.  Upon contact with water, the grout would begin to expand, eventually filling the entire void space of the hole.  Additionally, the product would need to be able to expand and contract yearly as the monoliths shrink and swell with temperature changes.  In order to insure that the entire drilled hole is filled, the product will need to be a solid product at the time it is placed into the hole.  This will provide a guarantee that the entire length of the drilled hole is completely filled with the waterstop product.  The product should be solid cylinders cut to a manageable length for installation.  The waterstop cylinders need to have the following physical and material properties:  <br>   	Specific gravity above 1.04.  <br>   	Expansion pressure between 250 and 450 psi at full depth.  <br>   	Unrestrained expansion diameter of 1.5 times the original cylinder.  <br>   	Service temperature range between 30 and 70 degrees F.  <br>   	Durometer hardness shore A scale A30.  <br>   	Less than 0.05 percent air entrainment.  <br>   	Confined compression strength over 900 psi.  <br>   	Cylinder diameter 5 inches with a 5% tolerance.  <br>  Additionally, the waterstop product manufacturer needs to have 5 years of experience performing waterstop remediation with 3 successful applications of the proposed approach at a depth that exceeds 100 feet below water.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 12,  Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 115 South 84th Street, Milwaukee, WI  53214

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Approval is requested to award a firm fixed price contract for continued and uninterrupted fire suppression services for the Hines VA Medical Center, Hines IL. The current contract expired November 30, 2013.  The proposed interim contract will be for three (3) months to allow the VA sufficient time to award the new Open Market competitive contract. The full base plus four option year solicitation is being processed under transaction 578-14-1-6072-0001.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Edward J. Hines VAMC in Hines, IL has a regulatory need for fire suppression services.  The cost of these services are $100,428.00 for the period of performance from 12/1/13 - 2/28/14). 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
( X )  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements per FAR 6.302-1.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Fire Suppression services are both a vital and essential service provided to the Veteran Patients and employees within the Hines VA Medical Center and it outlying clinics and buildings on the reservation.  The service provides fire support for its 3,000,000 enclosed square foot medical center and forty-five building complex which resides on a 170 acre federal reservation. Included are a psychiatric treatment facility, long term care facility, spinal cord injury residential care facility, blind rehabilitation center, out-patient clinics, medical research facilities, a warehouse, engineering shops, supply depot, veterans benefits delivery center, boiler plant, housekeeping quarters, non-housekeeping quarters and administrative offices.  Any temporary disruption of services could directly affect patient's health, welfare and safety without first responders to provide response to HazMat incidents, confined space rescue, fire alarms, fire suppression and fire emergency calls. Performance coverage is provided twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, 365 days a year. The time, cost, tasks and critical response times required will be greatly impacted by temporarily switching contractors to quickly compete a short-term requirement.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  The contracting officer has currently completed the market research process to conclude that no services are available on Federal Supply Schedule, with small businesses or SDVOSB or VOSB's and will have to be competed in the unrestricted open market. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The cost of the continued service is the same as the final option year pricing from the previous contract.  The cost will be the current contract price which was determined fair and reasonable by the CO at time of award.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The time, cost, and tasks required to switch contractors on a short-term basis severely restricts any ability to quickly compete a short-term requirement.  Vendors on the unrestricted open market will be allowed to compete for the long-term requirement.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Regulatory requirement guidance MP-3 Part III Fire Prevention and Suppression for continuity of service.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Village of Forest Park Fire Department, 517 Des Plaines Avenue, Forest Park, IL 60130.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or overcome any Barriers to Competition before making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: The primary step to overcome barriers to competition is focusing on properly competing the longer-term requirement which is the reason a three month short-term contract is being requested.  Contractors on the open market will be afforded sufficient time and opportunity to compete for the long-term contract.
