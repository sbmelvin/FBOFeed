The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards.   
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>This announcement is for information purposes only, NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.  The purpose of this public announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to increase the ceiling price of contract DTFAWA-09-C-00040 with MCR Federal, LLC by $742,862 from $36,809,171 to $37,552,033.  The FAA will shortly exhaust the available ceiling on the Contract.  The FAA anticipates migration of the current requirements on the contract to other existing contracting vehicles by July 15, 2013.  The use of a single source contract is in accordance with Acquisition Management System  3.2.2.4 and is in the best interests of the FAA considering the following: that the FAA is in the process of assessing long-term contract vehicle(s) to provide continuing service for the requirements currently performed under the Contract; this ceiling increase will allow the FAA to provide for continuation of services under the Contract while the FAA completes the process of assessing long-term contract vehicle(s); the short period of time remaining until the ceiling of the Contract is exhausted, the effect a gap in services would have; the temporary nature of the continued use of the Contract until the work can be transitioned to replacement contracts; and the redundancies and inefficiencies inherent in trying to obtain a different short-term bridge contract in order to have time to finish assessing long-term replacement contracts.

MCR Federal, LLC provides support for program management, program risk management, investment/alternative analysis, budget formulation and budget execution to the Air Traffic Organization-Terminal (ATO-T). 


This action is in accordance with FAA AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.

If you have any questions or comments please respond by 3:00pm, on May 21, 2013 by email to:  Chontice.Boykin@faa.gov.   Electronic responses are preferred. The point of contact for this requirement is: Chontice Boykin (202-385-6156).  The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this announcement.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.

New incoming Facility O&M contractor(s), requires time to become familiar with ATSPCs aging and sometimes obsolete building systems, their operation, and maintenance; obtain required IRS background clearances; obtain training; etc., which is typically accomplished during the 90-day contract start-up period prior to the contract effective date. Awarding the interim contract to other than the incumbent contractor heightens the Governments risk of encountering performance problems, or major system problems at this IRS center responsible for serving thousands of IRS employees throughout the southeast. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations or a solicitation of offers. No solicitation document is available. Interested parties may submit their interest and ability to meet IRS needs. However, responses received not later than noon May 23, 2013 as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by IRS not to open this requirement to competition based upon any written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of IRS. For information regarding this notice, contact Linda Bender, Contract Specialist, via email to: Linda.Bender@irs.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be honored or acknowledged.

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Cooperative Research Program of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Charter Vessel Support for research projects relative to the Northeast fisheries.<br />The NEFSC Cooperative Research Program, along with other research branches within the NEFSC, requires Contractor support in one or more areas of scientific investigation. Supported Research Projects for this contract will require participation by trawl vessels operating in Georges Bank. The purpose of the sampling will be (1) to augment sampling effort for commercially important flatfish populations on Georges Bank (NEFSC offshore strata 13-23) to improve stock assessments of these species; and (2) to provide increased biological sampling of these flatfish species in this area. Two vessels will be selected to sample approximately 75 bottom trawl stations each on Georges Bank during a 12 day survey. The survey will be performed using a standard NEFSC bottom trawl survey 4-seam net with cookie sweeps. The survey will focus on yellowtail flounder and winter flounder, but the project will attempt to assess as many commercially important flatfish species as possible. A new stratification scheme will be developed for this area to allow the most precise estimates possible and to account for areas that are known to be untrawlable with the cookie sweeps. <br />This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.

<DESC>G&Ouml;BEL MIRROR, 60mm, FOR Cu RADIATION,<br />INCIDENT / DIFFRACTED BEAM
<p>Graded multilayer optics for Cu radiation, including optical element, housing and slits. The parabolic bent G&ouml;bel Mirror creates a highly parallel incident beam while suppressing K&szlig; radiation. By capturing a large solid angle, the mirror turns otherwise<br />unusable radiation into a useful parallel beam. The G&ouml;bel Mirror enables the investigation of irregularly shaped sample surfaces and reduces the requirements for<br />exact sample positioning. Ideal for samples with low X-ray absorption. Considerable intensity gain for parallel-beam applications such as grazing incidence diffraction and reflectometry. A Cu long fine focus X-ray source is recommended for use with this optic. The optic mounts directly to the D8 X-ray source housing.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, AK, has a requirement for a three year maintenance service agreement for a USGS owned GS Junior Sequencing System manufactured by Roche Diagnostic, Indianapolis, IN.
This notice of intent is to announce the USGS will enter into a sole source agreement with Roche Diagnostic for the required maintenance.  
The maintenance agreement is necessary to allow the uninterrupted processing of data and analysis.  Roche Diagnostic is the only known source to perform this maintenance due to proprietary technology and the specialized tools and software required to diagnose, repair, and calibrate the instruments.  Only Roche Diagnostic trained service engineers and technicians are authorized to perform on the system without making null and void any warranty or other service agreements.      
No other sources are known to process the unique and essential qualifications outlined in  this justification.  The recommendation of the USGS Alaska Science Center in support of this noncompetitive justification is made in recognition of the fact that the competition must be obtained to the maximum extent practicable. 
Any potential vendors with the capabilities to perform the required services are encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer at sevans@usgs.gov or (916) 278-9334 with ample evidence that the requirements can be met.  Responses must be no longer than 15 pages.  The closing date of the RFQ, G13PS00404 is 24 May 2013.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.  Contracting Activity:  	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
Technology Acquisition Center
260 Industrial Way West
Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2. Title of Acquisition: Veterans Transportation Services (VTS) Veterans Identification Card (VIC) and VistA Integration Pilot
      		
This requirement will be accomplished via:

[ X  ] New Purchase Order

Purchase Order will be:

[  X  ] Firm Fixed Price			 

Type of Funds: 

[  X  ]  IT FUNDS (FCP: 1321 )

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:

[  X  ]  Services 

The proposed sole source action is for a three month firm-fixed price contract with RouteMatch Software, Inc. 1201 West Peachtree Street NW, Suite 3300, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 for support services to roll out the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Identification Card (VIC) and Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) integration pilot at three designated Veterans Transportation Services (VTS) Pilot Sites in Temple, Texas, Montana and Boston, Massachusetts.  Specifically, RouteMatch Software, Inc. will complete the training, testing and system acceptance portion of the VIC and VistA integration pilot project.  RouteMatch Software, Inc. is classified as a small business under North American Industry Classification System code 541511.   
 
Period of Performance:  three months

Estimated total cost: $39,826.50  

4.  Authority Cited:

[  X  ]  Other Federal Acquisition Regulation Authority (FAR) 6.302-1

The stauatory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(2) entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

5.  Reason for Authority Cited:

Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that only one source is available for the aforementioned services.  

The original contract for this effort was awarded on September 27, 2010 with a period of performance of one 12-month base year and four 12-month options.   On September 27, 2012, Option Year One was extended through March 20, 2013 to complete the integration work, however the contract was terminated on January 9, 2013, due to obligation of the wrong type of funding.  Therefore, this effort is being awarded to allow for completion of the services by RouteMatch to roll out VA's VIC and VistA integration pilot at the three designated VTS Pilot Sites.

During performance of the previous contact, the RouteMatch Data Interface Module (DIM) perpetual software licenses from RouteMatch Software, Inc.were previously purchased for each of the three aforementioned pilot sites.  During the development phase of this project, the DIM perpetual software licenses were implemented at the three pilot sites.  The DIM perpetual software licenses and associated support services will be used in the roll out VA's VIC and VistA integration pilot.  The DIM perpetual software licenses and associated support services are proprietary to RouteMatch Software, Inc.  RouteMatch Software, Inc. does not have affiliation or agreements in place with any authorized resellers to resolve technical problems and/or obtain RouteMatch Software, Inc. software updates; therefore, RouteMatch Software, Inc. is the only responsible source that exists to complete this effort.       
 
6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:

There is only one responsible source for these services.  Efforts made to locate additional sources are described under the Market Research paragraph of this document.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition.  Procurement data does not include any unnecessary requirements that may inhibit competition.  Furthermore, in accordance with (IAW) FAR 5.301(b)(6),this action will not be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunity Page (FBO) due to the dollar threshold.  IAW FAR 6.305(a) this Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made publicly available on FBO within 14 days after contract award.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:

In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be fully competed.   

8.	Market Research:

Market research was conducted by technical experts in February 2013.  
      
[ X ] The market research consisted of the following: 

Similar support services were reviewed by the technical team and it determined that they could not meet the requirements since the DIM perpetual software licenses were already purchased and installed during the development phase and are required for use during the  roll out VA's VIC and VistA integration pilot.  The DIM perpetual software license and associated support services are proprietary to RouteMatch, Inc. which mean that they are the only source capable of providing the necessary services required to complete the testing, training and software acceptance of for the integration phase of this project.  Additionally, this is a support service contract for existing software the Government already purchased.  Procuring a new software license at this point in the project would lead to a total restart of the project and result in considerable downtime, cost, constraints and training to implement new software tools.  The Government technical experts determined that no other services could meet the requirements. 

9.	Interested Sources:

[ X ] No other source has expressed written interest in supplying these services.

The modulator assembly amplifies and modulates signals from the transmitter radar signal simulator. The diode modulator operates in frequencies ranging from 650 to 920 MHz and generates a peak power of 50 kW. <br /><br />This notification is to also identify potential contractors who have skills, experiences, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for a proposal or invitation for bid. However, what the government will like to receive as a response to this RFI is a write-up from potential contractors highlighting their skills, experiences with, and knowledge of high power, high frequency transmitter components. Potential contractors should have skills in evaluation engineering, reverse engineering and design build. They should also have a high power, high frequency transmitter to test the diode modulator. It is in the best interest of potential contractors to also provide price estimates so that the program can prepare funding as necessary. <br /><br />Respondents to this request will be retained in a file and subsequently provided a copy of a Request for Proposal (RFP) if and when it is issued. Responding to this request in no manner guarantees a contract will be awarded to the respondent for the validation of the diode modulator data.<br /><br />All information received in response to this announcement that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.

<p><br /><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to manufacture, field, and sustain a laser eye protection system for aircrew members. Block 2 ALEP will provide protection against laser devices/systems in combat and training situations while minimizing visual acuity degradation and will be compatible with current Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE).&nbsp; Block 2 is highly specialized equipment in that it incorporates state-of-the-art filter and dye technologies. The Block 2 system must provide laser protection as well as visual performance for day and night operations and also be compatible with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) systems. The Block 2 system may not consist of more than three separate variants. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Force is looking to identify firms with the capabilities to build and deliver approximately 7,000 Block 2 ALEP production units. This effort shall include all management and technical support, quality assurance, planning, material and production support, and facilities for this production. Block 2 performance specifications are classified and requests must be submitted to the contracting officer along with evidence of the required facility and personnel security clearances at or above the secret level. The effort will be production only; no developmental efforts will be considered. Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM)/published price list, delivery timeframes, and capability statements.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Vendor/Manufacturer Qualification Requirements: </strong></p>
<p>Due to the complexity and criticality of this requirement, only manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar, can be considered approved sources for this item. The vendor's LEP device shall satisfy and meet all thresholds contained in the ALEP Block 2 performance specifications which include laser protection, optical qualities, visual performance, durability, and environmental requirements. The vendor shall provide test data that demonstrates physical compatibility with the aircrew population for frame compatibility (form/fit/function) with flight equipment (helmet/oxygen mask/headsets/visors/etc), JHMCS, and JSAM. The vendor shall provide test data that demonstrates visual compatibility for in-cockpit and out-of-cockpit environments for the United States Air Force (USAF) transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft. The vendor shall provide results of ground evaluations to verify the maintenance concept, fitting procedures, and in-cockpit pre-flight checks. The vendor shall provide results of operations test with a variety of USAF transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft. The vendor shall provide results of flight evaluations to verify operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness with USAF transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft.<br /><br /><br /><strong>RFI Responses:</strong></p>

<DESC>Project Manager Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment (PM-SPIE), Fort Belvoir, VA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to collect information for the development and possible future production of non-powered ballistic fragmentation protective transitional lenses. The ultimate goal of this effort is to meet the full technical requirements as described in the draft purchase description (PD). An incremental approach where baseline technologies are developed and then integrated may be taken to achieve the desired results. This RFI is for the purpose of collecting industry/academia feedback on potential technology available to include technology readiness level (TRL) 1 technologies and viability of a non-powered ballistic fragmentation protective transitional lens. <br>  <br> In the event that the Government decides to proceed beyond the RFI Phase the Government tentatively plans to utilize Broad Agency Announcements (BAA), Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) processes and research and development contracts to mature the technology to TRL 5. <br>    <br> Request interested parties provide, not later than sixty (60) calendar days of the posting of this RFI, a detailed description of technology available, capabilities of the technology, the TRL and the viability of meeting the PDs requirements.  In addition, recommendations/suggestions and/or comments on draft PD are welcome.  This information should be provided to via email Patricia M. Cuff, Contract Specialist patricia.m.cuff.civ@mail.mil. <br>     <br> This RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Quotation, or Request for Proposal. This RFI should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S. Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any company or entity that responds to this announcement. Interested vendors will be afforded the opportunity to discuss their technology with PM-SPIE after all responses have been received and based upon the availability of Government personnel.

<SUBJECT>Development of in vitro technologies for evaluation of Medical CounterMeasures (MCMs) 
<SOLNBR>HDTRA1-13-RFI-CBM01
<RESPDATE>061713
<CONTACT>Victor E. Cramer, Email victor.cramer@dtra.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued for planning purposes, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Department of Defense (DoD) is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. This notice is open to all sources.
<p>The rapid development of Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) directed against a chemical and/or biological agent is crucial to the ability of the United States to respond to a chemical/ biological attack. However, prior to administration in patients or individuals enrolled in clinical trials, the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the MCMs must be characterized first in pre-clinical studies. Current methods for obtaining this critical information for MCMs effective against biological/chemical agents rely, almost exclusively, on experimental models (in vitro and in vivo, including animal models) that frequently have limited correlation to the human condition and often do not accurately predict clinical safety, efficacy and tolerability in human.</p>
<p>While recent technological advances have prompted substantial gains in our knowledge of the mammalian immune system, much of this progress has been made through experimentation with animal models that fail to mimic human disease or poorly predict human immunity. Our understanding of human immunity is also hindered by the obvious experimental limitations of human subjects and the lack of appropriate assay systems to evaluate human immune cells. Regarding the latter point, many researchers still utilize a well-established PBMC assay, which was developed more than 30 years ago and relies simply on the culture of unfractionated PBMC in the presence or absence of an Ag or immune-modulator, as a means of evaluating human immune responses in vitro. The primary weakness of this approach - its inability to support the sensitization of na&iuml;ve antigen-specific lymphocytes- likely results from its failure to recapitulate the types of immune cell interactions that lead to these responses in vivo.</p>

Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources. Only small business sources shall respond to this source sought synopsis. <br />Project Title: ICS/NIMS Training Courses
<p>Project Description: To provide ICS and NIMS training courses that meet the objectives and requirements of FEMA sanctioned courses, including instructor qualifications for each course so FDA field, Headquarters and Centers can continue, implement and emergency preparedness program under the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), Management of Domestic Incidents, HSPD-5 that requires all Federal Departments and agencies to adopt the National Incident Management Systems.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), Management of Domestic Incidents requires all Federal Departments and agencies to adopt the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and use it in their individual domestic incident management, emergency prevention, preparedness, and response, recovery, and mitigation activities. FDA, other federal agencies as well as States receiving federal funding for homeland security initiatives are also required to implement NIMS principles such as Incident Command Structure (ICS) in their emergency response protocols, as well as in support of all actions taken to assist State or local entities during an emergency.</p>
<p>NIMS enhances the management of domestic incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive system for incident management, based on ICS and strengthens FDA's capability and resolve to fulfill its responsibilities to the American people in time of emergency.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking sources for the upgrade of the existing MPFM/confocal Microscope (Leica SP5 Multiphoton/confocal). This SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this SS. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this SS. This FedBizOps SS is strictly for market research purposes only. As a result of this SS, the Government may issue a RFQ, however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the SS.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the NHLBI may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a single contract.</p>
<p>All eligible companies responding to this SS Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of contract.</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The goal of this upgrade involves high resolution imaging of unlabeled and fluorescently labeled metabolites and structures in vivo. This will be accomplished using a combination of imaging techniques to include multi-photon fluorescence microscopy (MPFM) and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) on the same microscope stand. CARS allows for imaging of various metabolites including water, D2O, NAD+, and lipids in tissues. MPFM allows for the imaging autofluorescent metabolites like NADH, fluorescent markers for blood vessels, phosphorescent oxygen probes etc. For many years the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics (LCE) and Office of the Scientific of the Director, has pioneered aspects of non-invasive imaging using methods including MRI and multi-photon microscopy. Non-invasive imaging allows physiological processes to be followed without disruption of the natural environment of the specimen</p>
<p>This purchase is for the upgrade of an existing MPFM/confocal microscope (Leica SP5 multiphoton/confocal, serial #51 00000 835) to enable longer wavelength CARS imaging as well as MPFM on the same microscope. This requires a microscope capable of efficiently transmitting excitation wavelengths from 470 to 1300nm. It is also required that a very sensitive detection system be used to detect the CARS back reflected signal. This purchase will be used with a CARS spectrally focused laser system (currently on order) as well as a standard MPFM Ti:Saph laser.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement</p>
<p>1. The microscope upgrade must, at the same time, enable multiphoton fluorescence microscopy (MPFM). MPFM is a method which has been well established in all three labs for examining many physiological processes in living tissue.

<p>2. The system must be completely compatible and ready to use with current Labview in-house custom-written programs from LCE that interface with Leica acquisition software that the lab currently owns.</p>
<p>3. This microscope should exhibit a transmittance higher than 40% for excitation wavelengths in the range 680-1300nm to perform MPFM and CARS microscopy experiments.</p>
<p>4. The microscope must be fully compatible with an existing 4-channel non-descanned Leica external PMT detection system.</p>
<p>5. The microscope must have both resonant and non-resonant scanning modes which enable imaging speeds of 28frames/s at a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels.</p>
<p>6. Must have an additional two channel high quantum efficiency hybrid detection system that exceeds the quantum efficiency of standard PMT's over a range of emission detection range from 400-750nm.</p>
<p>7. Must be compatible with an existing Leica APD detection system in the descanned emission pathway.</p>
<p>8. Must provide a 20x water immersion IR apochromat objective that is corrected for chromatic aberrations in the 700-1300nm range, with an NA of at least 0.75, a long working distance of at least 0.6mm and a transmittance above 75% in the range of 400-1300nm.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall install the system in the LCE laboratory on the NIH campus (Bethesda, MD) within 2 months from receipt of award.</p>
<p>Companies that can perform the requirements above are requested to submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, data, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the task (s) as described above.

<DESC>Statement of Objectives
<p>Support for the Implementation of Enterprise Project and Portfolio Management</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2010, the Department of Housing and Urban Development was given new authority by Congress to conduct a transformation initiative in four areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Research, evaluation, and program metrics <br />&bull; Program demonstrations <br />&bull; Technical assistance and capacity building <br />&bull; Information technology</p>
<p>To better carry out HUD's mission and meet these challenges, the agency has developed an organizational "Transformation Initiative" (TI) to deal with the broad range of persistent management, programmatic, operational and human capital challenges. One of the five strategic goals for the Department is to transform the way HUD does business. As part of the Transformation Initiative, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) implemented the Information Technology Management (ITM) governance controls in FY 2011 to account for the usage of IT funding. To continue to support the department's transformation initiative the OCIO is expanding its governance to uniformly control the project and portfolio management for IT through the implementation of an Enterprise Project and Portfolio Management Solution and Service.</p>
<p>II. OVERALL OBJECTIVE OR SCOPE OF EFFORT<br />The purpose of this SOO is to obtain support to develop and implement an Enterprise Project Portfolio Management (EPPM) solution leveraging HUD's existing investment in the Microsoft EPM technologies such as Microsoft Project 2010 Professional and Project Server 2010 and by engaging with a vendor who will provide add-on products and services to meet the objectives outlined within this Statement of Objectives. Vendors with products that provide the desired capabilities "out-of-the-box" with configuration services will be preferred, however, custom developed add-on solutions will be considered. Some capabilities provided by the Project Server "out-of-the-box" will be covered, in this statement of objectives, but the focus will be on those additional capabilities provided by the vendor through its add-on software, and the services required to configure the solution in a "best practices" manner to meet the needs of HUD. <br />The EPPM solution will capture a defined set of metadata for IT related projects and in the future may be used to capture information about other types of projects. In addition HUD's EPPM solution will unify project and portfolio management into a single solution, data store and process thereby helping the organization to align resources and investments with strategic priorities more effectively, gain control across all types of work, and visualize performance by using effective and efficient dashboards.<br />The primary objectives are:</p>
<p>&bull; A Portfolio and Project Management portal to streamline and standardize the initiation of all types of work centralizing project and operational activities which provides visibility across all request and in-flight initiatives to effectively identify and eliminate duplicative request and quickly assess the impact on available resources.<br />&bull; An integrated solution providing a single point of access to project and portfolio data ensuring consistent access to common, authoritative data which allows top-down portfolio management techniques with bottom-up project management capabilities.<br />&bull; The standardization of the collection of data to facilitate enterprise reporting and increase transparency allowing leadership to make informed decisions.<br />The primary goal of the Enterprise Project Portfolio Management solution is to enable an integrated and cohesive information management system to collect, organize, process and manage the financial, operational, program &amp; project data needed to operate HUD's business and improve investment selection and service delivery for customers using Microsoft Project Server 2010 and any add-on software necessary to most efficiently and effectively meet the objectives.<br />Key Benefits:<br />&#61607; Enhanced Decision Making at the Portfolio Level<br />&#61607; Improve Project Delivery and Resource Management<br />&#61607; Visibility in to IT Demand and Capacity<br />&#61607; Ability to Manage One IT Portfolio<br />&#61607; Gain Financial Transparency<br />&#61607; Simplified Annual Planning Process &amp; Tools<br />It is expected that the EPPM solution's Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for IT Project and Portfolio Management will be developed and implemented within 4months, and that capability enhancements will continue through-out the year of services.<br />III. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS/SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>&bull; Provide common and standardized processes for project management, forecasting resource demand and reporting in a consistent and uniform manner.<br />&bull; Provide Enterprise information, data, and status suitable for the decision making and planning processes of the IT Portfolio executives and staff ensuring data whose origin is common throughout the enterprise. <br />&bull; Implement a solution that reduces overall development and sustainment costs to the Department improving the return on investment. <br />&bull; Manage risk associated with the project. <br />&#61607; Cost, schedule, performance risk<br />&#61607; Change management<br />&#61607; Technical risk <br />&bull; Deliver capabilities according to evolving requirements. <br />&bull; Provide administrator-managed access controls at the following levels (Portfolio, LOB, Program Area, Investment, Project)<br />&bull; Provide an audit trail of all transactions performed by user<br />&bull; Leverage current data as a means to control initial development cost, alleviate redundancy and duplicity in data and processes and, maintain data integrity, consistency and, reliability. <br />IV.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity: 

Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, VISN 1 Contracting, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts research program- Center for Information Dissemination and Education Resources (CIDER). Transaction Number 523-14-1-8172-0006.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 

Planning and implementation of 3 special VA HSR&D research symposiums  (break-out sessions) to be conducted at the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) national annual meeting to educate SGIM membership about major VA initiatives such as Patient Aligned Care Teams, implementation research and research operations partnerships to improve care for Veterans.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 

1).  Work with VHA HSR&D leadership in Washington DC to select priority topics. 
2).  Development of a work plan to address timely development of the symposiums for CIDER and VHA 
       leadership approval and acceptance.
3).  Researching and writing symposiums, recruiting and securing commitment from content experts to 
       participate as faculty, scheduling and implementation of sessions.

Approximate cost $25,000.00.
Period of service October 1, 2013 to no later than 150 days past award

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41USC 3304 as implemented by:

( ? )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency 
             Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert 
             Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):

The SGIM is a national medical society of 3,000 physicians who are the primary care internal medical faculty of every medical school and major teaching hospital in the United States including VA University affiliates. As such, SGIM possesses attributes that enable VA to reach a wide audience in a cost effective way.  Each spring, SGIM holds an annual meeting and the latest VA research findings are presented in series of 3 break-out sessions.  

General internists are the single largest group of professionals within the VA HSR&D investigator community. Accordingly, SGIM provides a critical link for disseminating important VA HSR&D findings and information to the broader healthcare community to improve the quality of patient care and medical education benefitting veterans and the nation.

In addition to their full understanding of VA requirements and challenges, they have experience with other federal agencies with similar objectives including the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services. Response to the services provided by SGIM has been overwhelmingly positive; VA sessions are requested by the membership.

Accordingly, VA-sponsored break-out sessions at SGIM's annual meeting provides a viable approach to disseminating VA research findings to a wide audience without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing the substantial cost of sponsoring their own meeting of general internists.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

While there may be other professional societies of internists, SGIM possesses attributes (3,000 member strong) that make working with them an advantage to VA.  This requirement does not meet the threshold for synopsizing in FBO.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

This is a fair and reasonable cost for this service.  Price analysis in accordance with FAR 13.106-3 will be conducted using comparisons to previously awarded Purchase Orders.  The most recent award was 523D25164 for these same services in FY12; it was awarded for $25,000.  The total estimated cost for FY14 is $25K.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

While there may be other professional societies of internists, SGIM possesses attributes (3,000 member strong) that make working with them an advantage to VA.  This requirement does not meet the threshold for synopsizing in FBO.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  CIDER monitors opportunities for dissemination of research findings and will propose additional sources when they become available.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

This event is widely publicized; SGIM has been holding their annual meeting for many years and presenting VA research findings for at least the last 5 years.  No other sources have expressed interest.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

CIDER monitors opportunities for dissemination of research findings and will propose additional sources when they become available.

The Portland OR VA Medical Center (PVAMC) is seeking the following professional services:

Project Scope: 
This contract is required because Portland Path&Lab (PLMS) needs reference lab services for Nasal Swap and Bronchial Alveolar Lavage specimen types using Respiratory Viral Panel on the Luminex.  PLMS usually does this testing in house.  Although, because of the sensitivity and complexity of our testing platform, the testing platform is at times unavailable.  To insure test results from reference labs correlate with our in-house results, both labs shall use the exact same platform.  In other words, the contractor methodology/platform shall mirror PVAMC PLMS methodology/platform. Our test methodology/ platform is Luminex 100 xTagTM technology with quantitative results as opposed to qualitative results. The targets for the Luminex 100 xTagTM are different than the targets other methodologies.  For the past several years, when our instrument has been down PVAMC has partnered with Viracor-IBT Laboratories to have these test performed using Nucleic acid based methods.  Historically, traditional methods such as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay and culture methods have been used to assist physicians in diagnosing viral respiratory tract infections.  Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification has shown greater sensitivity than DFA and culture with the additional ability to detect the presence of multiple and emerging viruses rapidly.   The ability of Viracor to identify a particular virus quickly and specifically as the etiologic agent for syndromic diseases like bronchiolitis and pneumonia has been demonstrated to result in reduced hospital stays, decreased use of unnecessary antibiotics, and elimination of superfluous diagnostic procedures and laboratory tests.

Firms offering a response to this notice should ensure that their registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ is current and should ensure that the applicable NAICS code (621511) is included in the SAM profile prior to submission of quotations.

The anticipated Base period of this contract shall be from date of award, through 09/30/2013.  There shall be 4 possible option years to exercise, depending on the needs of the VA.  The solicitation will result in the award of a single contract.  

Interested parties are encouraged to contact Jos Ronstadt, Contract Specialist, at jose.ronstadt@va.gov.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Hood intends to award on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Fort Hood Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund (Club Hood), 24th Street and Wainwright Drive, Bldg 5764, Fort Hood, TX  76544, to provide room rental for III Corps Command Group Events (Newcomer's Briefs, Commanding General Officer Professional Development (OPD) training events, Community Service Council (CSC) meetings, and Command Sergeants Major (CSM) Empowerment Sessions. All III Corps Command Group Events will require a room with a maximum capacity of 500 personnel. Set up and tear down shall be provided as a common business practice in accordance with Contractors price lists. Club Hood is the only reasonable source who can provide the required services in order to ensure the safety and security of participants at these scheduled events. On the installation, facilities incorporate all required antiterrorism protection measures and requirements IAW AR 525-13.  High profile functions should be conducted at on-post facilities due to enhanced security, sufficient access control measures and 100% vetting of visitors entering the installation.  These types of venues present a tempting target by terrorists or criminal elements against senior leadership and community leaders.  Off post venues would result in an unacceptable level of risk of potential attack or disruption by terrorist or criminal elements. Time is a considerable factor in fulfilling this contract because the Command Group Personnel are operating under a set schedule and travel time to and from an off post event would reduce command time. Soldiers and families that participate in these events would require longer time away from performing work or other duties. Many of these events are scheduled around peak traffic times which also added to time away from work and duties. Transportation for Command Group Personnel, Senior Leaders and up to 500 soldiers is a major factor that has implication on time and security. The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price award for a period of one 12-month base period with two 12-month option periods. Firms are requested to submit any questions/concerns regarding this noncompetitive contract directly to the contract specialist, Mark Ramey, at mark.a.ramey10.civ@mail.mil, and the contracting officer, Juan Perez, juan.c.perez8.civ@mail.mil, no later than 2:00 PM CST 3 June 2013. Questions submitted by other means will not be evaluated or considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Contract Number - R13PX60203
Project Number - Not Applicable
Treasury Account Symbol - 14 0680
Limited Availability of the Justification - As stipulated in FAR 6.001, contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of Part 13 are exempt from the policies and procedures to promote full and open competition in the acquisition process.  As such the Contracting Office is only making the J&A publically available at the Government Point of Entry for 30 days.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation No.: R13PS60203 Project Name: Operation and Maintenance Services; Dickinson Dam and Reservoir
In accordance with FAR 6.302, the proposed contractual action is pursuant to the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)( 1).
1. Agency and Contracting Activity - Requiring Agency:  Bureau of Reclamation, Dakotas Area Office, 304 East Broadway, Bismarck, ND 58501 Contracting Activity:  Bureau of Reclamation, Dakotas Area Office, 304 East Broadway, Bismarck, ND 58501
2. Nature/Description of Action - The proposed sole source action is for a one-year firm-fixed price (FFP) effort for operation and maintenance services using FY 2013 funds at Dickinson Dam and for certain land management activities along Dickinson Reservoir with Dickinson Water Utilities Department, Dickinson, ND.
3. Description of Supplies/Services - Reclamation is responsible for the operation and maintenance of Dickinson Dam and for certain land management activities along Dickinson Reservoir.  Dickinson Dam and Reservoir is located in western North Dakota immediately west of the city of Dickinson in Stark County.  The dam and reservoir were constructed in 1949-1950 as a multi-purpose project for irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and recreation.  Recreation management along the reservoir is administered by the City of Dickinson Parks and Recreation District under a management agreement with Reclamation.  Fish & wildlife management along the reservoir is administered by the North Dakota Game & Fish Department.
Currently, Reclamation has neither the personnel nor the equipment to successfully conduct all required operation and maintenance projects at the dam and along the reservoir.  The required operation and maintenance services to be completed on an as needed basis at Dickinson Dam and Reservoir include:
(1)  Conduct General Dam Site Surveillance Inspections of Dickinson Dam to check for unusual conditions and site security;
(2)  Make Gate Changes for adjusting water releases from Dickinson Reservoir;
(3)  Conduct vegetation control activities on the Dickinson Dam embankment and downstream area by mowing vegetation within specified areas for aesthetics, seepage monitoring, weed control, etc.; and
(4) Assist Reclamation with miscellaneous maintenance activities such as maintaining existing fences and gates for site security and public safety, removing debris from the dam, outlet works and spillway areas and performing other miscellaneous maintenance activities.
The work shall be performed on an as-needed basis as requested by the Bureau of Reclamation.  Payment will be made for quantities actually conducted by the contractor and accepted by Reclamation.  Without the timely performance of these services, Reclamation cannot adequately maintain a high-head dam or control vegetation on the Dickinson Dam embankment and downstream area.  Although many agencies and contractors can provide operation and maintenance services, a contractor that has firsthand knowledge of the area, that has attended Reclamation's "Damtender Training" would be ideal.
4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition - 41 U.S.C. 251(c)(l) - FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications - The proposed source for this action is the city of Dickinson Water Utilities Department, Dickinson, ND.  The city of Dickinson Water Utilities Depat1ment is currently the only entity in the geographic area with Reclamation trained dam tenders on staff.  Under the proposed requirement, general site surveillance inspections of the dam are required to check the status of the dam and associated facilities for items such as the temperature inside the control vault, status of downstream access gate closures, activation of the control vault alarm system and reservoir water levels.  The contractor is also required to make gate changes to adjust water releases from the dam.  Using a contractor without the required dam tender training could compromise dam integrity and increase the possibility of a dam failure and potentially endanger lives.
The city of Dickinson Water Utilities Department, North Dakota has conducted similar services as requested by Reclamation in past years under Cooperative Agreement 1-FC-60-02080.  They have continually demonstrated their ability to conduct the activities in a timely and cost effective manner.
6.  Description of efforts made to maximize competition - Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  None of these efforts yielded additional sources capable of completing the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for the proposed action.  Additionally, the estimated cost of the proposed action is more than the $15,000 threshold for disseminating information.  Therefore, Reclamation will post a "Notice of Intent" to FedBizOpps allowing other sources the opportunity to notify Reclamation of their ability to fully perform the required services.
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost - Pursuant to FAR 12.209 and 13.106-3(a)(2) and assuming one response is received, price reasonableness will be based on market research, historic pricing, current published price lists (such as the "Book Rental Values" for equipment use rates and wage determination rates for personnel rates) and/or comparison to the Government's Independent Cost Estimate.
8.  Description of Market Research Conducted - Market research was conducted on January 24, 2013 and February 19, 2013.  The required services are not available through UNICOR or AbilityOne.  GSA schedule 03FAC (Facilities Maintenance and Management Consulting), Category 81 l 006 (Facilities Maintenance and Management Consulting) was consulted.  No contractors have the required specialized dam tender training and experience to successfully complete this project.  An internet search was conducted for the geographic area of North Dakota and South Dakota.  No contractors providing dam tending services were identified.  Reclamation engineers with knowledge of the market were consulted and no additional dam tender providers were identified.
9.  Any Other Supporting Facts - As previously stated, without the timely performance of these services, Reclamation cannot adequately maintain a high-head dam on reservoir lands.  The City of Dickinson Water Utilities Department, North Dakota is a governmental nonprofit entity that has conducted similar services as requested by Reclamation in past years under Cooperative Agreement No. 1-FC-60-02080.  They have continually demonstrated their ability to conduct the activities in a timely and cost effective manner (when compared to equipment use rates, personnel rates and material costs).
10.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition - The city of Dickinson Water Utilities Department, North Dakota has unique qualifications, experience, and resources for assisting with O&M activities at Dickinson Dam and on Dickinson Reservoir lands that are not available competitively from private contractors.  No future competition for the above-specified types of work is anticipated as long as the city of Dickinson Water Utilities Department, North Dakota is Reclamation's cooperating entity in the O&M of Dickinson Dam.  Activities beyond the scope of the city of Dickinson Water Utilities Department, North Dakota operations as a cooperating entity will be open for competition

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA OIG) intends to negotiate and award on a non-competitive basis a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR subpart 13.5 to Microsoft for professional services identified herein.
<p>Background: FHFA OIG was established by law to provide independent and objective reporting to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). FHFA OIG's mission is to promote the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of FHFA's programs; to assist FHFA in the performance of its mission; to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in FHFA's programs; and to seek sanctions and prosecutions against those who are responsible for such fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>
<p>As part of this mission, it is vitally important that they run independent of the main FHFA infrastructure. FHFA OIG has completed Phase I, finalized Phase II of Microsoft Office 365 Cloud solution based upon the latest versions of Microsoft Technologies (Exchange 2010, SharePoint 2010 and Lync). Phase III is coming to completion and requires additional architecture and engineering services in support of the final construction and deployment of its new cloud information technology network infrastructure and systems. Phase IV will represent the completion of the Network Operating System Infrastructure.

<DESC>The following information is preliminary and subject to change. The National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA), John F. Kennedy Space Center provides notice that the Government will issue an Announcement for Proposals (AFP) seeking a qualified lessee who is capable of taking responsibility for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of Launch Complex 39, Pad A (LC-39A) as a commercial launch facility. LC-39A is a potentially useful, historically significant, launch platform for a commercial company or consortium, or other U.S. domestic entity, including state agencies, to use to support commercial launch activities while assuming financial and technical responsibility for O&M.  Such commercial use will protect LC-39A from deterioration resulting from non-use. Additionally, commercial use will support NASA in fulfilling its mandate to, seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space. 51 U.S.C. 20112(a)(4).  Such use is also authorized under the Commercial Space Launch Act, 51 U.S.C. 50913(a)(1), which encourages the acquisition by the private sector and State governments of launch or reentry property of the U.S. Government that is excess or otherwise not needed for public use.  NASA therefore envisions a lease with a commercial company or consortium or U.S. domestic entity that has a plan for use of LC-39A to support active launch operations, and which demonstrates the financial and business resources, as well as the technical capability and past experience, to make the fullest commercial use of LC-39A. NASA contemplates entering into one or more lease agreements under the authority of the Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLA).  If a Proposer feels a different contractual relationship is more appropriate, it may so stipulate in its proposal.	NASA intends to seek proposals to operate and maintain LC-39A as a commercial launch facility through an agreement or agreement(s) for a minimum of five years.	Proposers who are interested in a longer term agreement should be prepared to provide the proposed length of the agreement, and rationale for the required time period beyond five years.  Proposers should note that NASA will not act as the site operator for LC-39A under any lease arrangement and, therefore, Proposers will be expected to address site operation, as well as any anticipated launch operations, in their proposals. With the completion of Shuttle retirement activities, NASA will no longer fund the maintenance of the dedicated infrastructure and systems located at LC-39A.  In order to maximize the utility of the facility and avoid the deterioration that results from lack of regular maintenance, NASA intends to expedite the release of an Announcement for Proposals, with submittal of proposals due 30 days after release of the Announcement. Proposers may indicate their interest in this announcement through submission of a non-binding letter of intent by May 24, 2013.  This letter should include the following: 1)	Company name, designated point of contact, and relevant contact information for same; 2)	The nature of interest (i.e. exclusive user, part of multi-user consortium, site operator);  3)	Type of agreement contemplated (i.e. lease under CSLA, Space Act Agreement, Enhanced Use Lease).  This letter should be submitted to the Contracting Officer Officer listed below.  An electronic PDF file sumbitted by email is preferred.  Potential respondents are responsible for monitoring the Internet site below for the release of the Announcement and for downloading their own copy of the Announcement and any amendments. The Internet site, or URL, for the Kennedy Space Center Business Opportunities page is: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  This is not a solicitation for proposals and NASA does not intend to respond to questions about this synopsis at this time.  As necessary, further information will be provided as amendments to this synopsis.

<p>1752.209-74 Organizational Conflicts of Interest (July 2005)</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict.</p>
<p>(c) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must: <br />(1) Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and;<br />(2) Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or<br />(3) Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:<br />(i) Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and<br />(ii) Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.<br />(4) The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.<br />(5) If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.</p>
<p>1752.209-75 Reducing Text Messaging While Driving (Oct 2009)</p>

These initiatives should encourage voluntary compliance with the company's text messaging policy while off duty.</p>
<p>(b) For purposes of complying with the Executive Order:</p>
<p>(1) "Texting" or "Text Messaging" means reading from or entering data into any handheld or other electronic device, including for the purpose of SMS texting, e-mailing, instant messaging, obtaining navigational information, or engaging in any other form of electronic data retrieval or electronic data communication.</p>

<p>(b) Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.</p>

<p>1752.239-72 Contractor Access to OPM IT Systems (Nov 2012)</p>
<p>OPM's Center for Information Services has implemented policies to ensure the security and safety of OPM's information systems. One policy is the ability to audit who has access to OPM IT systems. For that reason the contractor must:</p>
<p>(a) Immediately following contract award, the contractor must provide to the distribution list "System Access Control" (systemaccesscontrol@opm.gov) an initial and complete list of employee's names that require access to OPM information systems.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor must send a staffing change report (Attachment 1) by the fifth day of each month after contract award to the Contracting Officer's Representative, contract administrator and systemaccesscontrol@opm.gov on a monthly basis. A template for the submission is attached. The report must contain the listing of all staff members who left or were hired under this contract in the past 60 days. This form must be submitted even if no separation has occurred during this period. Failure to submit a &lsquo;Contractor Staffing Change Report' each month will result in the suspensions of all user ids associated with this contract. The Contractor Staffing Change Report is supplied in Attachment 2 of this document.</p>
<p>(c) Each contractor employee is required to utilize individual identification and authorization to access OPM IT systems. Using shared accounts to access OPM IT systems is strictly prohibited. OPM will disable accounts and access to OPM IT systems will be revoked and denied if carriers share accounts.

<p><br />The Contractor must quote on all of the items listed above. Failure to quote on all of the items will result in elimination of that quotation.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a firm fixed priced purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>&bull; Technical Capability <br />&bull; Past Performance<br />&bull; Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>1. Basis for Award<br /><br />The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose quotation represents the best value to the Government, and who lowest priced offer is deemed to be technically acceptable. Best value as defined in FAR Part 2, is the expected outcome of an acquisition that in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. The Government will be conducting this procurement by using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) method.</p>
<p><br />When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use information provided by the offeror in their quotations as well as information obtained from the offeror's past performance information. Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with the offerors, with the exception of clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a). Evaluations may be based on the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's most advantageous proposal from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>2. Price</p>
<p>Price will be assessed for completeness, reasonableness, price realism and affordability. Price will not be given a specific rating, but will be evaluated and provided to the Contracting Officer as part of the integrated assessment.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance<br /><br />Past performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305Offerors with no past performance will result in an assignment of a neutral/unknown confidence rating, which will indicate neither a FAVORABLE nor UNFAVORABLE evaluation rating. In addition, if a Joint Ventures (JV) does not have any past performance as a JV or if the individual companies that comprise the JV do not have any past performance, then the JV will receive a neutral/unknown confidence rating. If the individual members do have past performance experience, then that performance will be evaluated on behalf of the Joint Venture. If the Joint Venture acts as the Prime, but has subcontractors, the subcontractor's past performance (if there is any) will also be used in the evaluation.</p>
<p>4. Exchanges</p>
<p>Exchanges with offerors after receipt of quotations do not constitute a rejection or counter offer by the government.</p>
<p>5. Best Value Determination</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order contract to the responsible offeror whose quotation has been determined to be technically acceptable and their lowest proposed price is deemed to be realistic, fair and reasonable.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal Criminal Tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have" the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate the vendors ability to perform per the statement of work as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.  Ability to meet the requirements and ability to perform per the statement of work, when combined, are equal to price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
 Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

(b) ABILITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating the vendors responses to the requirements.  The requirements are:
Minimum of 4 Years service experience with EATON Powerware Series UPS or with equivalent capacity UPS.  Equivalent is defined as any "225kVA" 480 volt, industrial UPS.

                      JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE.  THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER.  WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION, WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENTS REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE.  THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER
2. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
3. ESTIMATED AMOUNT (OVER $3,000 but not exceeding $100,000 )
4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE.
Purchase 2 each Engine Shipping/Storage Containers. NSN: 8145-01-574-2684, part  number 00068500400.
5. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED. These Containers are specifically designed for the Rolls Royce AE2100D3 Engine and prescribed by Rolls Royce Maintenance Manuals for storing/preserving and or shipping the AE2100D3 Engine. No other container will conform to the required configuration for Form, Fit, and Function (FFF). per the Rolls Royce Engine Maintenance Manual 72-05-00-10A-010.
 
6. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
Per Rolls Royce AE2100D3 Customer Service Manager; these containers are only supplied by The Champion Company, who is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  They hold rights to the technical data, and engineering drawings.
 7. EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  The Champion Company is the only company capable of designing this container.
8. PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED.  IF THIS IS FOLLOW-ON ACTION TO A PREVIOUSLY COMPETED ACTION, SO STATE. The Coast Guard will maintain open communications with all discovered sources from market research and continue to seek additional sources that may possibly receive OEM authorization to supply these containers. However, granting access to technical packages associated with these containers is solely a Champion business decision. Currently there is no alternative for the Coast Guards C-130J Fleet.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Quotes shall be emailed to London.c.venzon@uscg.mil . Technical questions TO David.H.Barber@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on (27) (May) 2013.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

This procurement will result in multiple awards for projects within these parameters at all locations, owned and leased, within the jurisdiction of the GSA West Virginia Office. Using this IDIQ vehicle, ordering officials will place individual task orders utilizing competitive procedures among all vendors awarded contracts through this procurement.</span></p>

The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing (except for assorted hourly rates), as projects within this dollar range could have significant variances in unit price values based on the size of the individual project. Rather, each project will be competed among the awardees of the IDIQ contract using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone, or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. All awardees under the IDIQ contract will be presented with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. It is anticipated that no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts will be awarded under this solicitation, although the government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside this range.</span></p>

Task orders may also be placed outside this dollar range if it is in the best interest of the government to do so; however, awardees have the option to decline any RFP's in this case. Utilizing a multiple award IDIQ will maximize competition, as all awardees will compete for each task order, resulting in favorable competitive pricing for GSA.</span></p>

This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the U.S. Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.       <br>              <br>       Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM-WIN-T) Increment 1 (Inc 1) seeks industry feedback regarding the Signal Modernization Program initiatives.  The Signal Modernization Program will transform and augment the Army's communication capabilities and extend the network to lower echelons via modular, scalable and interoperable nodes.  Operational requirements have pushed the need for nodes lower in the formation. These nodes will operate in commercial and military satellite bands and will support up to four enclaves with voice, data and video teleconferencing. These requirements will be executed via the Transmission Capability Production Document (CPD) and the Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) (CPD). Both CPD documents are still in the approval process with expected approval in 4QFY13 for T2C2 and late 1QFY14 for Transmission.  Formal guidance required to proceed with the acquisition program is being addressed with a Directed Requirement currently being staffed.         <br>              <br>       To demonstrate Signal Modernization initiatives, the Expeditionary Signal Battalion (ESB)  quote mark Proof of Concept quote mark  will demonstrate materiel and organizational changes in the ESB structure in order to provide increased network capacity / capabilities to support Command Posts (Company through Brigade) and to Install, Operate and Maintain (IOM) these capabilities without increasing organizational manning.   The intent is to reconfigure the 86th ESB at FT Bliss, TX and select Regional Hub Nodes (RHNs) to conduct a series of operational and system evaluations in FY 14-15.  These evaluations will include support to Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Functional Brigades and will be conducted in conjunction with the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) sponsored Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs).  The US Army Signal Center of Excellence (SigCoE) will use the  quote mark Proof of Concept quote mark  to confirm that the ESB can provide increased capacity / capabilities within full spectrum operations; support additional Command Posts; meet IOM requirements within the ESB force structure and reduce signal footprint / strategic lift requirements.       <br>              <br>       Extension of the Army's network footprint will be addressed via the T2C2 program.  T2C2 provides small teams and company-sized early entry units robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of joint operations. T2C2 supports Mission Command Applications and services. Variant 1 provides Global Information Grid (GIG) access to the small, highly dispersed team-size elements while At-the-Halt (ATH) on military satellites or commercial satellites. Variant 2 provides high capacity GIG connectivity to company size units command posts while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites.       <br>              <br>       Executive Summary       <br>              <br>       PM-WIN-T Inc 1is seeking industry feedback on five technology areas:  Terrestrial Line-of-Sight radios, Tropospheric Scatter technology, Deployable Cellular systems, Radio cross-banding, and Man-portable SATCOM systems.       <br>              <br>       Satellite communications is the primary connectivity between WIN-T Increment 1 and Increment 2 equipment. Incompatibilities between the terrestrial radios in the WIN-T increments cause inefficiencies in the network which are detrimental to military operations. PM WIN-T Inc 1 is looking for a solution that directly links WIN-T Increments 1 and 2 using high bandwidth terrestrial communications.         <br>              <br>       Additionally, PM WIN-T INC 1 is looking to replace the existing Tropospheric scatter (TROPO) communications equipment in the   ESBs   to provide greater throughput, require less manning and have significant deployment and employment advantages in size, weight, and power.       <br>              <br>       An interface to the WIN-T system is required to support soldier cellular data devices. These devices utilize a transport base station that will reside in WIN-T equipment. This capability is required at all command posts, echelons division through company, that are supported with WIN-T equipment. Cellular capability is also required at ESBs to support command posts that do not have organic WIN-T assets.       <br>              <br>       Provide small teams and company-sized early entry units robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of joint operations. T2C2 supports Mission Command Applications and services. Variant 1 provides GIG access to the small, highly dispersed team-size elements while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites. Variant 2 provides high capacity GIG connectivity to company size units command posts while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites.       <br>              <br>       Finally, provide a solution allowing connections between telephones, combat net radios, first responder radios and voice applications into a single, on-call voice network. The capability to bridge disparate voice devices into a net will be available from Corps through company echelons. Network management for this capability resides at Corps through battalion echelons.       <br>              <br>       Requirements       <br>              <br>       Terrestrial Transmission System       <br>              <br>       PM WIN-T Inc 1seeks industry feedback regarding availability of a production representative  high capacity line of sight radio that will meet the terrestrial transmission requirement of the Tactical Network Modernization for the ESBs which will allow Soldiers to seamlessly communicate between WIN-T Increments. Currently, each WIN-T increment leverages different waveforms which are not compatible.  Inc 1 employs the HCLOS UHF radio in the AN/TRC-190 and Inc 2 is fielding the On-the-Move capable Highband Networking Waveform.  These incompatibilities between the terrestrial radios in the WIN-T increments cause inefficiencies in the network which are detrimental to military operations.   Therefore, PM WIN-T INC 1 is seeking terrestrial transmission hardware platform that shall be capable of porting waveforms used by WIN-T to allow interoperability between Increments.       <br>              <br>       The terrestrial transport shall provide 32 Mbps measured point to point) (threshold), and 48 Mbps (objective) data throughput at 30 km per link.

Is that correct?  YES
Also, most containers have the pockets for the forklift will that be a problem if they are already there?  NO
I understand that you want delivery and placement.  How will you expect these units to be placed?  We could ship them on a roll of bed, but if you have items that will not make that possible then a crane will be needed to offload the truck.
Either way if fine, we just need notification of the proposed method of shipment. So we have proper offload equipment (Crane). <BR> <BR>COMMENT FROM AN INTERESTED SELLER : Well, as I have explained a 1000 times over, 99% OF ALL ISO CONTAINERS ARE MADE IN CHINA which is not a qualifying country.  I  could respond in 60 seconds to the requirement but it would not meet the stated requirements.
Anyone responding is either going to have to charge 300% more than normal retail for boxes from the two locations in the US that buy Chinese kits and then assemble in the US???
OR
The containers are not regular standard ISO certified shipping containers
OR
They are swapping out the plates and defrauding the Govt. which is something I simply will not do.
I have explained this to the Govt. for the last 30 years and yet it doesn?t sink in??I wish it would.
Please note our new contact information below.

Response:  Thanks for the Information. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Protective Service (FPS) Region 3 has a requirement to obtain armed protective security officer (PSO) services for federally-owned or leased facilities throughout the State of Delaware.&nbsp; A competitive 5-year indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract consisting of a 1-year base and four 1-year option periods for PSO services is contemplated to maintain continuity of operations and ensure that FPS meets its mission requirements of safeguarding federal employees and federal property, as well as citizens at these locations throughout the State of Delaware.&nbsp; The required class of security guard services is Guard II, and FPS requires a mix of fixed and roving armed PSOs providing interior and exterior coverage, with some posts requiring 24-hour coverage across 11 locations.&nbsp; These essential security services include access control to facility entrances and exits, employee and visitor identification checks, monitoring security equipment, and roving patrols of the interior and exterior of federal facilities. This requirement will be satisfied through task order acquisition.&nbsp; The&nbsp;forthcoming competitive, open market&nbsp;request for proposal (RFP) will be a 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)&nbsp; concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561612, which falls under the scope of Protective Guard Services. The planned period of performance for the subsequent IDIQ shall encompass a base period of twelve months - 01 March 2014 to 28 February 2015 and includes four (4) 12-month option periods.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the above mentioned forthcoming RFP will&nbsp;be issued&nbsp;in&nbsp;June 2013 with an approximate 30-day closing date.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

The Portland OR VA Medical Center (PVAMC) is seeking the following professional services:

Project Scope: 
This contract is required because Portland Path&Lab (PLMS) needs reference lab services for Nasal Swap and Bronchial Alveolar Lavage specimen types using Respiratory Viral Panel on the Luminex.  PLMS usually does this testing in house.  Although, because of the sensitivity and complexity of our testing platform, the testing platform is at times unavailable.  To insure test results from reference labs correlate with our in-house results, both labs shall use the exact same platform.  In other words, the contractor methodology/platform shall mirror PVAMC PLMS methodology/platform. Our test methodology/ platform is Luminex 100 xTagTM technology with quantitative results as opposed to qualitative results. The targets for the Luminex 100 xTagTM are different than the targets other methodologies.  For the past several years, when our instrument has been down PVAMC has partnered with Viracor-IBT Laboratories to have these test performed using Nucleic acid based methods.  Historically, traditional methods such as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay and culture methods have been used to assist physicians in diagnosing viral respiratory tract infections.  Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification has shown greater sensitivity than DFA and culture with the additional ability to detect the presence of multiple and emerging viruses rapidly.   The ability of Viracor to identify a particular virus quickly and specifically as the etiologic agent for syndromic diseases like bronchiolitis and pneumonia has been demonstrated to result in reduced hospital stays, decreased use of unnecessary antibiotics, and elimination of superfluous diagnostic procedures and laboratory tests.

Firms offering a response to this notice should ensure that their registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ is current and should ensure that the applicable NAICS code (621511) is included in the SAM profile prior to submission of quotations.

The anticipated Base period of this contract shall be from date of award, through 09/30/2013.  There shall be 4 possible option years to exercise, depending on the needs of the VA.  The solicitation will result in the award of a single contract.  

Interested parties are encouraged to contact Jos Ronstadt, Contract Specialist, at jose.ronstadt@va.gov.

<DESC><p>SIDEARM demonstrates that Bayesian Probabilistic Inference, implemented on emerging analog devices, affords the computational expressivity approaching purpose machinery and is capable of handling the high demands of complex image processing pipelines, such as ARGUS-IS, with 10,000x less energy and 1,000x more processing capacity.</p>
<p>SIDEARM (Sensor Inference and Decision Engine via Adaptive Regulation of Memory arrays) provides a comprehensive solution through co-design of the inference module (IM). It uses the strengths and weaknesses of achievable Mixed Signal (MS) CMOS and memristor device technology combined with the requirements of state-of-the-art processing pipelines, such as the Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) pipeline of BAE Systems&#8223; Autonomous Realtime Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Imaging System (ARGUS-IS)&nbsp;In particular, SIDEARM includes eight innovations to produce a generally applicable compute model that meets or exceeds 1,000x speed increase and 10,000x power reduction targets.</p>

See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> PRIORITY 3 ACQUISITION <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD <br> FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> BELOW THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD <br>  <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, <br> TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Epicel-CEA skin grafts needed for <br> a non-routine surgery. <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services: Epicel-CEA are sheets of skin cells ranging <br> from 2 to 8 cell layers thick. The grafts are grown or cultured from a sample of <br> patient's own healthy skin. <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting competition. For purchases not <br> exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit <br> from one source if the contracint officer determines that the circumstances of the <br> contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency). <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a)(2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling <br> requirement will not be advertised. <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition. Price and availability <br> will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5. Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is <br> a true, urgent request that has been verified by Darlena Rivera on 19 Apr 2013. <br> The Epicel Skin grafts are lab grown epidermal tissue that requires at least nine <br> days notice to prepare and schedule for arrival. These skin grafts must be <br> received for this one-time, non-routine surgery by 29 Apr 2013. If the physician <br> does not have these skin grafts for the surgery, it could be detrimental to the <br> patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission. <br>  <br> 6. Contracting Officer Certification: I certify this justification is accurate and <br> complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> Signature://Original Signature//Date 04/22/2013 <br> Name:Emerita Torres <br> Title:Contracting Officer <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> Southern Regional Contracting Ofc, ATTN:MCAA S L31 9V, 3851 Roger Brooke Drive, Fort Sam Houston, TX  78234-6200 <br>  <br> Point of Contact(s): <br> Darlena Rivera 210 221-4541

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<ARCHDATE>06092013
<DESC>The Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD AMIS) has a requirement to renew Tricerat brand Screwdrivers Software Annual Maintenance to support the Transportation Coordinators' Automated Information for Movements System II (TC-AIMS II).The existing infrastructure for TC-AIMS II system is compatible with Tricerat software brand. If another brand were to be incorporated into that TC-AIMS II infrastructure it would significantly increase the potential for IT equipment and network failures. Additionally the infrastructure and the entire network would have to be re-engineered to be compatible with non Tricerat Software. Tricerat Screwdriver software has been fully tested. If compatible software was acquired, PD AMIS would have to obtain Authority to Operate before implementation and perform comprehensive testing prior to integration. This would require additional time and cost to re-accredit TC-AIMS II system for software other than Tricerat. TC-AIMS II software images and configurations are currently accredited for Tricerat software. If the software maintenance is not received, PD AMIS will not be able to provide expedient fixes to fielded software. However, more than one source within the marketplace is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required. We intend to compete the requirement as a 100% small business set aside on FedBid.  A brand name justification has been approved and is being posted with this announcement.  The period of performance is January 14, 2013 through January 13, 2014.   Responses to this announcement must be emailed directly to Steve Perry, the Contract Specialist, at steven.r.perry32.civ@mail.mil. less than br greater than
