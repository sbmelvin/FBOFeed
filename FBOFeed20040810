The following work is required:  1)  Habitat Use and Population Ecology of Riparian Woodrats and Black Rats at Caswell Memorial State Park - continue investigations of habitat use and population ecology of woodrats and black rats using trapping, house-marking, and tagging techniques, tracking the female woodrats that were radio-collared, monitor their reproductive success and determine the relationship between reproductive success and presence of black rats, determine whether black rats are partly or largely responsible for population declines of riparian woodrats; 2)  Effects of Landscape Alteration on Competitive Interactions Between Coyotes and San Joaquin Kit Foxes - determine whether use of space and abundance of coyotes are affected by landscape alterations, assess interference and exploitative competition between kit foxes and coyotes in altered and unaltered habitats; 3)  Feasibility Study of and Strategies for Reintroducing San Joaquin Kit Foxes on Vacant or Restored Habitats - develop scientifically-based criteria for selecting sites for kit fox reintroduction, identify tentative list of lands suitable for possible kit fox reintroduction, develop recommendations for strategies and techniques to be tested in reintroduction efforts, develop success criteria for kit fox reintroduction efforts, identify regulatory requirements to be addressed prior to reintroduction; and 4)  Monitor Trans-Located Riparian Brush Rabbits - hand track radio-collared rabbits using 2-Element "H" style directional antennas and directional five-element antennas and portable receivers either mounted on vehicles or placed at telemetry stations, monitor rabbits daily, conduct intensive tracking sessions to assess 24-hour movements, follow signals to determine which patch of vegetation they are using, measure and floristically describe habitat patches and map using global positioning system.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.

Any firm that believes it can furnish services described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (916) 978-5175, Attention: Mary Sims, or by email at msims@mp.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).

<DESC>This synopsis, originally posted as a total small business set-aside on June 24, 2004, is being issued unrestricted because no responses were received from small business sources by the July 9, 2004, response date.  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC,) Health Services Research and Evaluation Branch (HSREB) of the National Immunization Program has a requirement for implementing and evaluating the impact of a community-wide program to vaccinate adults age 65 and order for influenza and pneumococcal vaccine while they are obtaining emergency room care at hospitals in the community.  The HSREB seeks to have this implemented in one of the following states (Georgia, Florida or Louisiana) where influenza vaccine coverage is below the national average and in a community with a large proportion of African Americans.  The entire scope of work and evaluation considerations are listed below.

Statement of Work

Title: Increasing vaccination coverage among  Medicare recipients by vaccinating during emergency department visits

I. Purpose of Contract
The Health Services Research and Evaluation Branch (HSREB) of the National Immunization Program seeks assistance in implementing and evaluating the impact of a community-wide program to vaccinate adults age 65 and older for influenza and pneumococcal vaccine while they are obtaining care at hospitals in that community.  The HSREB seeks to have this implemented in a state where influenza vaccine coverage is below the national average (as defined below) and in a community with a large proportion of African Americans.

II. Background and Need
Despite national and state efforts, influenza vaccination coverage among adults age 65 and older has not increased and remains between 60% and 70% .  According to the National Health Interview Survey, three states (Georgia, Louisiana, and Florida) – had coverage below 60%.  All these states have large African American populations, and low coverage in these populations contributes to racial disparities.  One possible explanation for low vaccination coverage is that previous efforts have not sufficiently targeted older adults whose access to influenza vaccine is limited.  Vaccination in of hospital inpatient and patients seen in emergency departments has been shown to be a cost effective approach to immunizing and preventing hospitalization among people who have not been vaccinated in traditional primary care settings.  However, emergency department vaccination efforts usually target younger patients and have been primarily conducted in a single medical center in Chicago.  The potential impact of more widespread emergency department vaccination on vaccine coverage in a population of Medicare beneficiaries is not known.  In a pilot study, we found that 142 (51%) of 281 Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and over seen in an Emergency Department in late December and January had not received influenza vaccine.  A similar proportion had not received pneumococcal vaccine, and over the influenza vaccination season, we estimate 50% of these unvaccinated beneficiaries will accept influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, or both when it is offered free of charge (as it must be to Medicare beneficiaries) by paramedical staff in the ED or hospital.  

III. Scope of work
The scope of this work is to implement a low-cost hospital-based vaccination program for unvaccinated adults age 65 and older.  An ideal setting for this study is a contractor that has access to:
•	a large population of adults age 65 and over who do not regularly receive influenza vaccine and have never received previously pneumococcal vaccine
•	a significant proportion of African-American patients  (at least 50%)
a low cost approach to screen and offer indicated influenza vaccination to all patients age 65 and over cared for in the emergency departments and inpatient units of the hospitals in the community 

IV. Tasks to be performed
The vendor shall:
•	Approach at least 80% (minimum 8)of hospitals in the Standard Metropolitan Area to participate in the influenza and pneumococcal immunization effort. 
•	Project the number of Medicare beneficiaries who can be vaccinated during emergency department visits during the four months from October through January
•	Supplement these efforts with vaccination of Medicare eligible inpatients, to total 10% of the Medicare eligible seniors who were not vaccinated in the 2003-2004 season, who have not previously received pneumococcal vaccine, or both. 
•	Assure hospitals that agree to participate will order sufficient vaccine to vaccinate 50% of the Medicare patients that they expect to see in their emergency department between October 1, 2004 and January 31, 2005.
•	Screen and hire college undergraduates or equivalent to work with the triage nurse to identify emergency department and hospital patients who are Medicare eligible.  
•	Approach each Medicare beneficiary will be approached to determine if and when they last received influenza and pneumococcal (PPV) vaccines and if they have any contraindications.
•	Develop a standing or preprinted order to vaccinate the patients (available at www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3074.pdf)
•	Counsel those reluctant to be vaccinated
•	Measure all costs of implementation

V. Contractor provided materials
The vendor shall provide all labor and materials necessary to complete order requirements, except that participating hospitals shall purchase and administer vaccine.  

VI. Government provided materials
Draft protocol

VII. Period of performance
The period of performance shall commence of the date of receipt of the purchase order and shall continue for a period of 1 year.

VIII Deliverables
The following deliverables must be delivered to the project offices at the times established below:
Deliverables						Date					
Dataset with documentation				Sept 30, 2005
Cost model						Sept 30, 2005

Evaluation Considerations
Experience and Qualifications of the Vendor:

•	Access to hospitals in a community with a significant percentage of previously unvaccinated Medicare beneficiaries
•	Ability to screen and vaccinate at least 150 Medicare-eligible patients per day for four months between October 1 and January 31.
•	Pre-professional or medical students, nursing students, medical assistants, or other similar personnel to assist patients in self-assessment and counsel patients regarding vaccines

Basis for award of a contract will be on the demonstrated ability to perform the work specified herein by showing past experience, qualifications of personnel working on the project, a conceptual design proposal and a detail cost proposal. Once a contract has been awarded, an additional detailed technical proposal shall be required for review and approval before a notice to proceed will be issued. See "Deliverables" and "Evaluation" sections for additional and specific requirements for each proposal. 03. Background: The existing Hatchery fishery water consists of the following: a. One 25,000 gallon water storage tank approximately 500 feet from the hatchery building. Water is gravity fed to the hatchery building. The tank has several floats for detecting the tanks water level which are used to control water flow to the storage tank. The tank has 120 Volt electrical power available at the tank, however, the power is not connected to the emergency generator. b. Four wells approximately 1mile from the hatchery water storage tank. Each well has it's own well house, 15HP submersible pump, electrical power, motor controller and appropriate electric relay type controls for starting/stopping and protecting its own pump  and other well house features (door monitor, freeze protection, lights, and etc). Each well house now has lightning protection and a Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor bonded to the building's electrical panel. c. The well field (consisting of all 4 wells) has one electrical service and one emergency electrical generator to protect the wells from brown outs and sags. Each well house has it's own electrical distribution panel sub-fed from the well field electrical service. W ell house #1 has electric controls to select the lead well and establish priority of operation of the remaining 3 wells. In addition, well house #1 contains the generator's automatic transfer switch and appropriate controls to automatically feed the lead well. d. Originally, the storage tank floats sent start/stop signals to the well field (well house #1) by a telephone transmitter and receiver connected together by twisted pairs of #22Awg underground phone. The phone transmitter and receiver were hit by lightning before the lightning and surge suppressors were installed. As a result both transmitter and receivers have been removed and the controls are temporarily direct wired between the storage tank and well house #1 which operates only the selected lead well.  B.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for Consulting services and a summary report on high temperature composite research efforts for rocket and hypersonic propulsion applications.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Warburton Enterprises. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. CMC materials have been pursued for hypersonic propulsion systems and vehicles since the NASP program. One of the materials most suited for the very high temperature Hypersonic environments are Carbon/Carbon Composites (C/C). The technologies on which many of the current C/C materials and coatings are based were developed in the late 1970s and 1980s for jet engine applications. Unfortunately this early experience is about to be lost unless it is documented for future reference. One of the key people to have intimate knowledge of the early C/C Technology Development Programs was the P&W Program Manager of many of the P&W C/C programs, Mr. Robert Warburton. Mr. Warburton retired from P&W in 2002, and is currently offering consulting services through Warburton Enterprises. Mr. Warburton represents the last opportunity to document the technology and experience that was so critical in achieving the NASP C/C technology level. Much of this technology has been lost in industry since NASP, and therefore the documentation of the early work is vital to our future Hypersonic programs. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 20, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NA This proposed procurement is Unrestricted.  SIC is 1542 and the NAICS is 236220.  The solicitation for the Expansion of the National Defense University located at Fort McNair in Washington, DC is being advertised as a Two Step Request for Proposal (RFP). This work under this project is required in order to provide an adequate academic facility to accommodate the consolidation of various functional elements of NDU.  This RFP requires separate technical, design and price proposals, which are to be submitted in  separate phases, and are to be evaluated on a Best Value basis for award of the project.   The project description and overall performance requirements for this requirement will be included in the solicitation package.  The design and construction criteria for this project will be included in Phase II of this solicitation, which will be furnishe d by an amendment.  The evaluation of the proposals will consist of two (2) Phases.  In Phase I of the solicitation process, offerors are to submit a technical qualification proposal only, without extensive design information and without a price proposal.  The full Quality/Technical Proposal (technical-design and performance capability) will be required in Phase II, after the initial short list of the most highly qualified firms has been established.  The “short list” will be limited to a maximum of five (5 ) offerors.  During Phase I, the Government will only evaluate the relative capabilities, and past performance of the competing firms.  Offerors should submit technical qualification proposals that are acceptable without any need for additional explanation  of information.  The Government may make a final determination regarding a technical proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  The Government may proceed with the second phase without requesting further information from a ny offeror, however the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that are considered reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  A “Notice of Unacceptability” will be forward  to offerors upon completion of the Phase I evaluation whose technical proposals were determined to be unacceptable.  In Phase II, only those offerors who are short-listed will be allowed to design and price proposals. The evaluation in Phase II will be of  the offeror’s design and price proposal.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Large business firms that are selected to continue onto Phase II are required to submit a subcontracting plan at the time for receipt of their price proposals.  The fo llowing subcontracting dollar goals pertain only to the dollar value of the contract that is subcontracted.  60% of the subcontracted dollar value shall be for small businesses, of that 60%, 20% shall be for Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), 10% shall be for Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), 3% shall be for HUB Zone Small Businesses (HUBZ), 3% shall be for Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and 3% shall be for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRS57-04-Q-80150 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  The NAICS Code is 541511 and the Small Business size standard is $18.0M. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order and to so licit and negotiate on a sole source basis with OAG Worldwide, Inc., Downers Grove, IL, to provide standard subscriptions services described below. The Volpe Center has a requirement for domestic and international airline schedule data as part of the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center’s (Volpe Center) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) project, in support of the FAA. The ETMS relies on this data to allow the Air Traffic Control System command Center (ATCSCC) to effectively and safely manage the nations airports and airspace. Current and accurate flight information is used in ETMS to balance aircraft capacity and demand for airports and airway fixes, and is used by ATCSCC specialists to predict traffic problems and to avoid delays by implementing national traffic management  initiatives. The services required demand that ETMS have continuous and reliable flight schedule data. The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services to provide the following standard subscription services, (1) WEEKLY BULK DATA TRANSMISSIONS – the Contractor shall provide for a full flight schedule to be made available weekly on a day and time to be coordinated with the Volpe Center.  The range of data shall be for 45 days; (2) WEEKLY FLIGHT RECORD CHANGES – 1. Provide effective and discontinue dates. If there is no effective date available the date reverts to the first day of the delivered data files. If there is no discontinue date the date reverts to the last date of data. There are to be no assumptions. 2. Provide a carrier code in  the carrier code field when there is no match in the FAA carrier code table. This change will give the FAA more flexibility in determining which carriers are missing from the FAA carrier code table. 3. Provide for the deletion of multiple flight records. Since the flight data is primarily a marketing tool, the schedule information contained in the scheduled flight data may reflect a slightly different set of flights from what is actually flown during the applicable time period. 4. Provide all flight leg segments for flights worldwide. 5. Provide all segments of scheduled flight records. There will be times a carrier will fly from a U.S. airport to an international airport with a non-ticket-selling stop at another U.S. airport. The second segment of this flight should be included; (3) AIRCR AFT/CITY T RACKING SYSTEM (ACTS FILES) – The contractor shall provide an updated copy of airlines equipment and airports made during the previous quarter;  (4) DATA TRANSMISSION – The files will be placed in a directory on a host machine, which can be assessed remotely by Volpe Center staff.

The file structure for the bulk data transmission files shall be: ASCII, Sequential File, 56 characters per line. Proposals shall include pricing for the following items in a written quotation: CLIN 0001 – Quarterly ACTS File (4 EA) _________. CLIN 0002 - Weekly OAG Update – (52 EA) ________.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ecosystems Research Division (ERD) intends to award a competitive fixed-price purchase order using Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, for Enantiomer Selectivity in Toxicity of vinclozolin to Japanese Medaka Fish.  Endocrine disrupting chemicals have the potential to adversely impact reproductive processes.  Many environmental pesticides are known to possess endocrine disrupting properties.  The dicarboxyimide fungicide vinclozolin has been shown to induce cytochrome P450 in both mice and rat mammalian systems.  The monooxygenase enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of the parent vinclozolin and the known end-products have been shown to possess antiandrogenic properties in both mammals and fish.  Vinclozolin is a chiral compound; that it, it consists of two species called enantiomers, mirror image isomers that usually differ in their fate and effects.  The purpose of this acquisition is to test the enantiomers of various pesticides for differences in their toxic properties.  Under this effort, a species of fish, the Japanese Medaka, will be employed in a new approach to assay the two separate enantiomers of vinclozolin for differences related to the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541380.  A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 25, 2004.  Interested parties should send an email request for a copy of the RFQ to Owensby.Anne@epa.gov.  RFQs and any subsequent amendments will be emailed to all interested parties.  The RFQ will include the Statement of Work and the technical evaluation criteria under which offers will be evaluated.  All questions should be directed to Anne Owensby via the email address above.

The EPA has identified Tatracore, Inc., the only firm capable of satisfying the  requirements stated above. The circumstance permitting "other then full and open competition",  FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements". Interested parties who can meet the above requirement may submit written qualification  statements, fully explaining their capabilities no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

<ARCHDATE>09242004
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Laconda Cannady, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-2631
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519 The Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a sole source contract to BGI Inc., Waltham, MA pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Environmental Protection Agency has a  requirement for twelve (12) PQ200A- PM2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) Audit Samplers, one (1) Delta-Cal Verification Device, four (4) Battery cases and, two (2) Main Unit cases.  All which require shipping to multiple locations.  EPA believes that the BGI PQ200A audit sampler and accessories is  the only sampler that can meet EPA's requirement for the following reasons: 1) The BGI PQ200A audit sampler is the only sampler that has an internal battery that will allow it to run without having to be plugged in at a site.  This is an invaluable feature that prevents EPA from missing out on  sampling operations when a host site does not have room for an additional electrical plug.  It also protects EPA from losing samples in the event the electrical outlet power fluctuates. 2) EPA's Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT) field staff are only trained to the BGI PQ200A.   Introducing new makes of FRMs would require the creation of new standard operating procedures and additional training for all Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) personnel. 3) ESAT field staff are only trained on the BGI PQ200A for troubleshooting and specific maintenance issues that are necessary  to allow for quick field repairs and calibrations.  This is very important as these ESAT field operators do all of their work on the road away from their main offices.  4) Although all FRMs are "the same," there are known (although unquantified) slight biases that exist between FRM makes.  The fact  that the PEP uses a certain make FRM consistently over time will help in bias determination not only between PEP and state, local, and tribal monitors, but between FRM makes.  If the PEP program were to get away from exclusively using BGI's, EPA would lose some insight into the FRM make bias issue.   5) Using other vendors of FRM would cause repercussions in the PM2.5 laboratory operations.  Other FRM vendors use slightly different filter cassette holders, which would potentially require a large investment by the PEP program to allow the laboratory to accommodate new types of filter cassette  holders.    EPA anticipates the award of a fixed-price purchase order.  The period of performance shall be within twelve (12) months from date of award.  NAICS No. 334519 applies, with a size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist and,  therefore, no Request For Quotation is available.  All interested parties must respond within 15 days of this date of announcement. Interested parties who believe they are qualified to perform this effort shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly support the requirement  outlined above and; 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  Submit responses  to US Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn:Laconda Cannady,  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency. No telephonic or faxed request will be honored. Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  If no affirmative responses are received  within 15 days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the procurement of these services with BGI Inc..

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection agency intends to award a sole source purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to the Maryland Department of Planning (MDP) for the development of a growth simulation model for the Chesapeake Bay watershed based on the New Jersey Growth Allocation Model (GAMe).   The MDP is intimately familiar with the environmental, demographic, and policy conditions that affect urban growth in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  This knowledge, coupled with the specific expertise in the development of the GAMe and growth modeling in  general, makes the MDP uniquely qualified to modify and adapt GAMe for application throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  The EPA has identified the Maryland Department of Planning as the only organization with the qualifications and products to perform the task within the prescribed time frame,  i.e., FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements".  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements must submit qualification statements including detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to  determine a bonafide capability to meet the agency's requirements no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Responses without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive.  This is not a formal notice of solicitation.  Please reference RFQ #14JR31 in any  correspondence.

<CONTACT>Mr. Tracy Downing, Esq. - 703.390.6474   Fax: 703.390.6582/6562
<DESC>To all those interested in the above RFP.  Per FAR 15.206 (e), BIA is canceling this RFP for the following reasons: 1.    BIAâ€™s requirements for this type of system have changed. 2.    Inadequate information being posted on â€œinput.com,â€ which is a private "for pay" site that conglomerates and distributes Federal Government contract award information.  BIA did not authorize the posting of this information to â€œinput.comâ€ and the posting consequently created numerous problems that have since seriously jeopardized this RFP competition.  The three files that appeared on â€œinput.comâ€ did not contain ALL the pertinent information for the RFP, primarily the initial cover letter going out with the RFP materials to properly requesting vendors. Consequently, BIA received several calls, questions, and inquiries from companies that were not on this RFPâ€™s bidderâ€™s list, items that were already answered if those vendors had obtained the proper information from this office.  This RFP is public information.  However, what appeared on â€œinput.comâ€ did not contain all the materials and therefore vendors relying solely on what they saw on â€œinput.comâ€ did not receive up to date and accurate information.  Prospective offerors are reminded for future acquisitions that FedBizOps is the ONLY authorized electronic source for Government contracting opportunities and that FedBizOps and directions contained in the announcement on FedBizOps are the ONLY sources for accurate and up to date information.  Any information obtained from any other electronic source other than from FedBizOps is solely at the risk of any offeror relying on such information. Due to the above reasons, BIA regretfully must cancel RFP # RMK00040064 dated 28 July 2004.  A new advertisement for the revised work should be forthcoming in the next few weeks with a projected start date in October, i.e. next FY.  Also, the new advertisement and subsequent procurement will be a Buy Indian Set Aside.  BIA appreciates the time and effort all vendors took to prepare proposals for the RFP. Sincerely, Tracy Downing, Esq. Bureau of Indian Affairs 703.390.6474            (direct) 703.390.6582-6562       fax

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submissio Place: Ministry of Commerce of Afghanistan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Industrial Parks Capacity Building Program- Afghanistan  :  The Ministry of Commerce of Afghanistan invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance (TA) on an industrial parks capacity building program.  The TA will include assisting the Afghan Industrial Estates Development Authority in developing its capacity to design and implement a sustainable industrial parks program; assisting Afghan businesses in relocating to the proposed industrial site; and advising on the creation of a sustainable diploma program that will provide Afghan entrepreneurs with the vocational capacity and training to create thriving businesses.  

After two decades of turmoil, Afghanistan’s infrastructure is in a poor state.  The international donor community and the Government of Afghanistan have focused on the development of the business sector, since it is the key to creating jobs and income that are critically needed to foster development and trade.  In 2003, USTDA Director Askey announced an Industrial Capacity and Market Development Initiative for Afghanistan, for the purposes of helping to develop private sector capacity in manufacturing, assembly and services.  This TA is part of that initiative.

As part of its development strategy, the Government of Afghanistan has embarked upon a comprehensive program to develop industrial parks throughout the country.  Industrial parks often provide a range of value-added services, either as part of a lease or on a fee-for-service basis.  These can include: security and access control; labor recruitment; training facilities; specialized industry service centers; logistics facilities; payroll processing; and environmental management.  The development of industrial parks, therefore, can attract and facilitate private investment and employment.  It can also focus development efforts by quickly making new investment locations available.  Despite these efforts, the current industrial property development framework is inadequate, and there is a need for Afghanistan to create a new model.  

In 2003, USTDA supported a Definitional Mission to Afghanistan, which recommended that USTDA fund a TA to address these issues.  The U.S. firm selected to conduct this TA will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $373,000 grant to the Ministry of Commerce from USTDA.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or Afghanistan.   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to SOFAZ c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. September 16, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Ministry of Commerce reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Ministry of Commerce also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Ministry of Commerce is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Institutional Capacity Building for the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan  :  NOTE: This is a re-announcement.  Those who have previously submitted bids for this technical assistance have the option to submit a new proposal or resubmit a previous one.

The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on asset management.  The technical assistance will include reviewing and refining SOFAZ’s current asset and risk management guidelines and policies; selection and implementation of portfolio management software; legal support; and developing an operations manual for SOFAZ. 

In December of 1999, the Government of Azerbaijan created SOFAZ in order to accumulate and manage oil-related revenue and maintain it for the purposes of future generations.  SOFAZ became operational in September of 2001 after its statutory regulations, asset management guidelines and budget rules were put into effect.  The Government of Azerbaijan charged SOFAZ with the following strategic objectives: (1) prevention of severe macroeconomic distortions that might be caused by excessive hard currency inflows; (2) assuring the fair distribution of petroleum wealth within Azerbaijan and for future generations; (3) managing SOFAZ’s assets to yield incremental income; and (4) directing a portion of its assets to implementing priority social and investment projects in Azerbaijan.

Since its inception, SOFAZ has received over $1.1 billion in revenues and incurred expenditures of only $300 million, leaving assets in excess of $800 million.  Annual revenues between 2004 and 2006 are expected to range between $150 million and $170 million, while as a result of the commissioning of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas export pipelines, revenues will increase substantially after 2006.  Revenue from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly oilfield alone is expected to exceed $25 billion over the next 25 years.  SOFAZ has recognized that it needs assistance in developing its human resources and institutional capacity in order to undertake managing these windfalls.

In February of 2004, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funded a Desk Study to review the proposed technical assistance.  The aim of the technical assistance is to help SOFAZ strengthen its asset and risk management policies and capabilities.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $1,091,840 grant to SOFAZ from USTDA.  


 




A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking a qualified, golf course developer to develop and operate the White Oak Golf Course within the Federal Research Center (FRC) at White Oak in Silver Spring, Maryland. 

GSA has identified three objectives for the development and operation of the White Oak Golf Course. These objectives are: 
1. Leveraging private sector experience, resources, and capital to manage, redevelop, and upgrade the golf course while maintaining the integrity of the FDA complex and preserving a historic resource. 
2. Enhancing community outreach by facilitating interaction between private sector and local community. 
3. Using the Cooperative Use Act to increase the value of the golf course to the government.
This Request for Qualifications (RFQ) represents an opportunity for developers and development teams interested in being considered as the developer and operator of the White Oak Golf Course.  The RFQ stage is the first stage in a two-stage selection process. The objective of this RFQ stage is to identify the most highly qualified developers based on key factors that will be outlined in this document.  In the Requests for Proposals (RFP) stage, GSA will issue an RFP to the 'short-list' of qualified developers that are identified at the RFQ stage.  Please note-THIS RFQ DOCUMENT REPRESENTS YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO BE QUALIFIED AND PLACED ON THE SHORT LIST FOR THE RFP.  

The idea to seek a private developer/operator for White Oak golf course comes at a great time for those interested in responding.  It is anticipated that the potential customer base for White Oak golf course will continue to grow tremendously over the next five years.   

---Pre-Submission Tours are scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on August 18 and August 20, 2004. Interested parties should contact Sheldon Jobe, 202/260-0767, to schedule participation.---

<DESC>The Support Equipment and Vehicles Development System Office (SEV DSO) is seeking interested sources for the production and delivery of the AN/GYQ-79  Common Munitions Built-In Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE).  The system  mission is to initiate munitions Built-In Test (BIT), report BIT results, and  upload/download munitions software applying to MIL-STD-1760 and smart non-MIL- STD-1760 munitions.  The CMBRE is approved for operation with multiple  munitions in the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corp, and foreign  military inventories. The CMBRE was developed by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) - Missile Systems Company  in Clearwater, Florida which is currently the prime contractor of the CMBRE.   Production quantity for this follow-on effort is estimated at 552 CMBREs.  It  is contemplated that a firm fixed-price contract, a basic year with seven (7)  one year options, will be awarded in October 2005 with the first delivery of  CMBREs estimated to be in August 2006, with a minimum quantity of 20 and  maximum quantity of 100 delivered per year.  Successful completion of first  article testing on the equipment will be required for any manufacturer not  presently qualified and must be accomplished within six (6) months after  contract award.  First article testing shall fully demonstrate compliance with  all specified requirements and complete compatibility with existing Munition  Application Programs (MAPs).

<DESC>UPDATE:  The site is hereby modified to include the attendance list from the 04 August 2004 site visit.  RFIs that have been received to date will be posted  as soon as answered. UPDATE:  The update is to schedule another site visit, for those interested.   The site visit is planned for 0900, 12 August 2004 (Thursday).  Same rules as  the previous visit apply.  Please fax or e-mail the list of visitors, with  SSN+s, to FAX 257-2825, or Tom.Kielbaso@wpafb.af.mil, by close of business 10  August 2004.  Request that firms limit participation to 4 people each.  UPDATE:  This update is to post Amendment #1 to the solicitation which consists  of Addendum #1 to the specifications, establishment of additional options, 3  new drawings, and a change to the site visit date.  The date for submission of  the proposal is unchanged from 18 Aug 2004. UPDATE:  This update is to notify all that an amendment to the solicitation  will be posted today, 28 July 2004.  Accordingly, the site visit scheduled for  today at 0900, has been postponed until 04 Aug 2004, at 0900.   This acquisition is for the Replacement of the HVAC Distribution System AFRL  Headquarters Facility 20015, Project 920014C.  The renovation of AFRL  Headquarters is in accordance with the long range Strategic Plan to improve  office space to an acceptable standard and maximize efficient utilization of  WWII facilities.  A major rework of the HVAC system (1970’s vintage) and  upgrade of Fire and Life Safety systems is long overdue.  In addition to code  compliance issues, a new suspended ceiling system, new fire detection and  suppression system, new carpet and paint will be installed.  Project will be  completed in two phases due to the configuration of the air handling units and  the lack of temporary office surge space. Special Requirements and Concerns:  Tight control of all subcontractors will be  imperative for success of this project due to the high profile occupants in the  building, HQ AFRL, GAO, and ASC/JA.  The construction will be completed in two  phases.  Occupants will have to relocate to another building during their phase  of construction.  Contractor will not be able to start work on Phase II until  he has completed Phase I, the occupants have moved back to Building 15 and  Phase II occupants and their furniture have been relocated.  Contract will  include maintaining temporary electrical and HVAC systems to occupied portions  of the building during construction.  Scope also includes hazardous material  abatement of asbestos and lead paint.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Human & Robotic Technology which was posted on June 28, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made:  Posting of Questions and Answers and a revision to the BAA. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to briefing charts and further details is located at: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/ExplorationPortal I.  Cont'd Questions/Answers: Q44.	Can one assume that the Prometheus Program will provide an energy rich environment for future missions and that our NOI concept can take advantage of this energy? A44.	Make sure your assumptions are clearly stated in your NOI and major dependencies of other programs. Q45.	Is a formal Government Task Agreement or other formal commitment from NASA Centers required with the Notice of Intent? A45.	No, the offeror is only required to make a good faith effort to identify any collaboration with NASA Centers for the NOI.  A Government Task Agreement will be required with the full proposal. Q46.	Will failure to team with a NASA Center result in non-selection? A46.	We will evaluate the appropriateness and suitability of the proposed project team partnership for the proposed project.  There are no predetermined go/no-go criteria. Q47.	What’s the position regarding ownership of the original intellectual property, are proposers automatically required to assign the patent rights to NASA?  We’re fine with NASA having a free license for future applications (assuming the project goes ahead), but would proposers still have the right to exploit the technology in other markets (e.g., for European based satellite projects).	Would NASA be willing to help maintain the patent costs? A47.	The government only obtains rights to “subject inventions.”  A subject invention means any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under the contract.  Thus, if any existing invention (“original intellectual property”) has already been reduced to practice it will not be considered a subject invention to which the Government obtains rights. 	Specifically regarding inventions made (conceived or first actually reduced to practice) by foreign contractors the Government will obtain the full right, title and interest in and to each invention throughout the word, except the State in which the contract is to be performed.  As to such State, the contractor grants to the Government an irrevocable, nontransferable, nonexclusive, paid-up license. Q48.	If UK sub-contractors are allowed, do we need to register the application or the company name with NASA’s Office of External Relations? A48.	There is nothing in the BAA that requires such a move. Q49.	For a proposal team, is collaboration with a partner from the European Space Agency considered a plus or a minus (or neither)? A49.	Collaborations with ESA are not treated differently than any other proposals received for this BAA.  Q50.	What International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) rules apply to collaboration with a partner from the European Space Agency? A50.	All ITAR and Export Administration Regulations (EAR) requirements, exemptions/exceptions, and prohibitions that are appropriate will apply.  In the context of cooperation with ESA, there is no ITAR or EAR policy of denial.  However, there are a number of EAR license exceptions that are applicable when considering cooperation with other partners, depending upon the particular technologies or hardware involved.  Of course, the H&RT BAA is likely to involve more ITAR-controlled technologies/hardware than EAR-controlled technology.   The ITAR rules that apply will, in all cases, depend upon the technology and the foreign participant. Q51.	Many respondents plan to leverage technologies developed for DoD and therefore subject to ITAR control.  Does NASA have a plan to control technologies/data subject to ITAR? A51.	NASA controls transfers of technologies/technical data that are subject to export control (under the ITAR and EAR) through the NASA Export Control Program, NPD 2190.1 & NPR 2190.1.  NASA contractors are, likewise, obliged to comply with the export control laws. Q52.	Do respondents have to identify ITAR-subject technical data to be used in the program? A52.	Generally, respondents do not have to identify ITAR-subject related data.  Please refer to the NASA FAR Supplement, section 1852.225-70 (Export Licenses) that provides as follows: "EXPORT LICENSES (FEBRUARY 2000)   (a)  The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract.  In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.    (b)  The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at [insert name of NASA installation], where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.    (c)  The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.   (d)  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors." Q53.	If proposal as a private company were to involve a Russian launcher and the contractor were to use some or all of the funds received to procure flight assistance from that Russian launcher, would NASA anticipate that would be in violation of the Iran Non- proliferation Act (INA)? A53.	It is difficult to predict what cases may be influenced by the Iran Non-proliferation Act (INA).  The answer will depend on the specific technology being developed and the intended scope of the cooperation. For instance where data derived from a human spaceflight testbed is combined with other research and eventually leads to and option for human spaceflight, the connection may be too attenuated to trigger INA restrictions.  The answer depends on the specific technology being developed. Q54.	NASA has requested that proposers write-in a primary theme for the project type.  In the BAA under each element program (i.e. 1.2 Advanced Materials and Structural Concepts (AMSC)) they have listed different themes related to that element as shown below.	Within each theme several topics of interest are also identified. Is it permissible to write in the identified "topics of interest" within a theme or should the primary theme be limited to the provided technical themes (i.e. a. Advanced Materials)? a.	Advanced Materials b.	Structural Concepts, Dynamics and Controls c.	Mechanisms and Interconnects d.	Flexible Fiber Systems e.	Smart’ Materials and Structures f.	Space Environments and Effects A54.	Use the provided technical themes listed above so that we can determine the relevance of what is being proposed. Q55.	The HRT Notice of Intent submittal form (on-line) on the registration page, the Project Title field is character limited to about 50 characters. Is it be acceptable to abbreviate the Title on the registration page since the HRT BAA input Form Title is not character limited? A55.	Adjust your title accordingly in order for NASA to identify it with your proposal. Q56.	Under the project type section of the HRT BAA input there is a pull down menu for a secondary element.  What is the purpose of indicating a secondary element?  Will there be two areas of review, one for the primary and one for the secondary? A56.	There will only be one NOI review and one proposal review.  The use of the secondary selection is mainly to help NASA better determine if what is proposed is really relevant to H&RT goals and objectives.	  Aside from a primary impact, NASA needs to know what other significant areas of technology research development the proposed project will influence.  II.  Revision to the BAA: An amended BAA will be posted at the website noted above.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available products.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  
The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct research that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, there is a need for lightweight, transportable frame used to attach standard 2’x6’ visual landing zone marker panels (orange on one side and purple on the other).  At existing forward operating locations, the system will be used to mark short field landing zones.  The system must be collapsible in case of aircraft strike and must be designed for quick set up and tear down. The attachment points on the panels are brass corner grommets with parachute cord loops.  The specifications for the system are as follows:
1.	Must be transportable in Blackhawk X-1Raptor backpacks with dimensions 16”x13”x20” with optimum fill space of 1’x1’x6”.
2.	Must be compatible with C-17A VAMP system slotted panels.
3.	Must be collapsible in case of aircraft strike.
4.	Must be durable to withstand jet blast.
5.	Stakes cannot be used to hold panel to the ground because of packed gravel with concrete stub (personnel have access to sandbags).
6.	Able to rotate on a hinge point to ensure the ability to flip the panel for opposite wind changes.  This is desired but not required.

The AEFB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is to solve this problem.

The AEFB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:
1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the capabilities needed for the above problem.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 24 Aug 04 to Capt Dean Ramsett, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Early submittals would be appreciated.  Capt Ramsett can be reached at (208) 828-3546.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the fabrication, and testing of goggles using biometric technology that will allow users, based upon the need-to-know and security clearance, to examine information on a blank whiteboard.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of Biometric Secure Visual Display technology.  The envisioned system should utilize biometric technology to provide a visual display through the glasses, based upon proper clearance, in an area where joint operations are occurring.  Given that capability, Combat Air Forces could ensure secure mission accomplishment in a joint working environment.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.

The AEFB is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating a secure biometric display that will be activated by the individuals’ biometrics and which automatically filters the content displayed based upon the identification of the individual and their security clearance. The system should allow full color display. The system should adjust uniformly and instantaneously, be flexible and rugged.

Request information to be submitted NO LATER THAN 08 September 2004 to MSgt. Paul Weber or Capt. Andrea Vinyard, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  MSgt. Weber can be reached at (208) 828-3524 and Capt. Vinyard can be reached at (208) 828-3520.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to establish contracts for the development of a digital family of undercover “Body Wire” systems for use by undercover agents and officers. Body Wire systems are employed in multiple configurations, depending on the operational scenario, for the covert collection of audio. Modularity of design, interoperability, and physical device covertness, clarity of audio reception and minimization of potential detection of the RF signal are key parameters for the systems. In concept, the systems will consist of body worn transmitters, covert transmitters, receivers, and repeaters.

The Department has developed a detailed specification document that will provide the scope of the specifications, essential requirements for performance, design and verification. As of the date of the release of this announcement, the specification document is covered under “Law Enforcement Sensitive” guidelines. The Government reserves the right to review the specification for classification at a later date. 

In order to receive the document and be considered for future action under the anticipated procurement you must supply the following information:

(1) Clearance information:  Current facility and key official security clearance information. Include your Defense Security Service (DSS) and DISCO facility and personnel security clearance information including your DSS/DISCO point of contact. If you do not possess a security clearance, your company must be able to pass a background check prior to participation.

(2) Past Performance:  Provide at least five references for work performed that is similar in scope and magnitude. These references must be for work performed no earlier than 1999.  Please provide current contact information for your references. As a minimum, provide contact name, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and mailing address. This data will allow the Department to review past performance in support of law enforcement and the intelligence community in the area of undercover and body worn RF and solid state transmitters, recorders, receivers and repeaters.

(3) Company Overview: Provide a brief overview of the company and the technical backgrounds of the key cleared personnel that will work on this program. Include what percentage of the engineering and manufacturing process will be completed in house.
Please provide enough company information to allow the Government to make a determination of responsibility and corporate fiscal soundness.

The Government will review clearance information and perform background and reference checks. For those firms with acceptable backgrounds, it is anticipated that the Government will conduct pre-proposal meetings with each individual company.  The Government will brief the specification and provide the Request for Proposal (using “Law Enforcement Sensitive” guidelines).  The resultant contract(s) are expected to be for one year with four one-year options on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, fixed price basis.

Although this announcement is public, no further public announcements will be made about this procurement under “Law Enforcement Sensitive” guidelines.  Information shall be submitted electronically to william.thoreen@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The Global Positioning System Joint Program Office (GPS JPO) intends to redesign the IIF space-qualified Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard (RAFS). The existing RAFS has parts obsolescence problems that will prevent deliveries after FY2008. The GPS JPO is funding the development of a replacement RAFS to avoid a gap in availability. Perkin Elmer is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the RAFS for the Block IIF SV's. The Production Drawing Package for the existing Block IIF RAFS is Perkin Elmer proprietary and is not available to the public.  Perkin Elmer is the only known company with the requisite knowledge capable of providing the development to the requirements within the required time period. This development program is to provide an initial industrial base to support further development and procurement. It does not include production deliveries and will not directly result in the procurement of RAFS's by the GPS JPO. It is only intended to develop a qualified replacement product that is suitable for potential future follow-on Block IIF SV production orders. The scope of the development is to design, test, qualify and deliver a space-qualified AFS that meets all of the requirements of the GPS Program's Block IIF Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard, with specifications identified below. SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The RAFS provides a precise and stable sinusoidal frequency at 10.229, 999, 995, 43 MHz (in a vacuum) for the GPS SV. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following contract objectives are provided as reference: (a) Develop and deliver production representative RAFS in accordance with the performance and design/program specifications as defined in Boeing specification document MC409-0262 "GPS IIF Rubidium Frequency Standard" (including the nuclear and space radiation environment as specified in Appendix I) and its companion specification documents MC409-0285 "GPS IIF Common Requirements".  Completion and delivery shall be within 42 months after receipt of order for two verified Flight Demonstration Units to be used for life testing and one tested Qualification unit (with a qualification test report); all three units are to be built with qualified flight components. The anticipated period of performance is October 2004–April 2007. (b)	The product must be completely form, fit and function compatible with the Block IIF RAFS as defined in the referenced specifications. (c) Support the generation or update of RAFS and related documents as directed
(d) Establish a strong, near real-time dialog and feedback structure with the GPS JPO to provide government insight, achieve quick issue resolution, and respond to government direction. Prospective contractors should submit information in writing no later than 01 September 2004 with documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements. Respondents to this announcement are encouraged to provide, in addition to their capabilities statements, information regarding their assessment of the value of data rights and/or licensing agreement and any other suggestions to assist the government in achieving its objective of developing a replacement for the Block IIF RAFS. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors, or teams, capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable risks and costs. Respondents are required to submit a current statement of capability, if they have not already done so.  The capability package should provide a synopsis of relevant capabilities and past experience with the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in space AFS technologies (including prior successes in achieving development and production of space qualified AFS's; the response must emphasize the proven ability to meet the above scope and schedule), and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC), which clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort.  Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor, subcontractor, or interest in using license to become a developer and supplier.  All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed five (5) one sided pages. Oral communications are not acceptable. Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary or competition sensitive data, they must request additional directions from the primary POC, Lt Jason Bolger.
This synopsis is for planning purposes only; any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover; the government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions.  All questions will be considered in future program-planning efforts. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. In addition, the government is interested in receiving industry views regarding the ongoing government acquisition planning efforts.  The government intends to post draft and planning documents in the GPS Bidders Library as they become available to allow industry to view and make comments.  Parties need to register with the GPS Bidder's Library, to obtain access.  Please submit a letter listing all of the individuals requiring access, and justification for access, and all contact information inclusive of email address.  Please submit requests to: Lt Jason Bolger, Program Manager, GPS Space Atomic Frequency Standard, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245, Phone: 310-363-2937, Fax: 310-363-6487, Email: Jason.Bolger@losangeles.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>B--Intent to Sole Source with The Dupuy Institute for Casualty Estimate in the Iraq War
<DESC>GovWorks on behalf on the Center for Army Analysis intends on awarding a sole source contract to The Dupuy Institute (TDI) for the below listed requirement.  CAA is acquiring services to produce an estimate of the possible intensity and duration of a guerilla war In Iraq.  Intensity will be measured in terms of "blue side" (intervening forces) losses.  As such, it will serve to provide a casualty estimate for such a war.  Since this estimate will also address duration of the conflict, this effort may serve as a basis for doing cost estimation.  This project will also attempt to address projected force sizes for such a war. The focus of the research is to examine casualties from various guerilla conflicts in the 20th century, including but not limited to Indonesian War of independence, Greek Civil War, Indochina War, Malaysian Insurrection, Mau Mau Revolt, Cypriot EOKA Insurgency.  The award will have four tasks and a final report.  The focus of the research is to examine casualties from various guerilla conflicts in the 20th century. TASK 1, Conduct a survey of strengths, losses, and duration of a number of guerilla wars in the past. TASK 2, Collect statistical data about force strengths and losses, assembled on a monthly or more detailed basis. Determine the patterns of losses in the various wars examined, including the degree of variation in casualties from month to month. TASK 3, Determine if casualties tend to peak at certain points during the course of the operations; and whether one can determine by comparisons of Iraq data to some or all of the other operations, if the casualties in Iraq will decline over time, increase over time, or remain at a steady state. TASK 4, Assemble basic narratives of each of the guerilla wars in an attempt to identify those major events or turning points in each of the wars that resulted in a downturn or upturn in the casualty patterns. This project will provide unique insights to the Army leadership and to the analytical community casualty estimation in guerilla conflicts, and specifically the Iraq war. TDI will provide a final report at the end of this effort. It will consist of seven major sections: Introduction and background, General Description of various guerilla conflicts, Statistical data and analysis of casualties in guerilla conflicts, Detailed description of casualties in guerilla conflicts, Brief Description of the Iraq war; Detailed description of casualties in the Iraq guerilla war,  and Conclusions.  TDI is a Non-Profit institution and the only known provider of scholarly research and objective analysis of historical data related to armed conflict and the resolution of armed conflict.  The use of TDI in a sole source contract is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  TDI has been chosen because of previous efforts that have been completed by TDI, their expertise in the field, and their availability to complete the project in the short time period necessary for the analysis project.  The anticipated award date is August 23, 2004 and the total project length is estimated at 141 days.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any questions regarding this effort should be directed to Sarah Roper at (703) 787-1808, or by email at sarah.roper@mms.gov.

(vi) STATEMENT OF WORK:  BACKGROUND - The IBB is a federal multimedia international broadcasting service that broadcasts over 900 hours of news, informational, educational, and cultural programming every week to a worldwide audience of 91 million. Programs are produced and broadcast in English and 52 other languages. IBB is one of the largest multi-media newsgathering organizations in the world, using radio, TV, the Internet, and satellite feeds to local stations to reach a worldwide audience. IBB's Washington, D.C., headquarters, where it produces all programming, is equipped with more than 40 radio studios, three (3) television studios, a digital stereo master control with 432 incoming circuits and 360 outgoing circuits, and two centers to record reports from IBB correspondents around the world.  This training effort is a part of the IBB leadership development initiative.  The IBB Leadership Development Program (LDP) prepares leaders to deal with the challenges facing the agency. Such challenges include downsizing, workforce restructuring, changing technology, under representation of women and minorities, and mission changes. At the same time, the large number of managerial employees projected to leave the organization over the next five (5) years will result in a severe shortage of leadership at the agency.  The program addresses the resulting severe shortages in all levels of supervision and management and provides training and developmental activities for new supervisors through Senior Executive Service (SES).  The focus is on acquiring the competencies that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management has identified as being critical to the success of Federal leaders. The LDP has four major goals and objectives: (1) To provide a systematic development program based on the competencies that have been prescribed for effective leadership in the IBB.  (2) To provide a continuum of training that is consistent with policies established in the Federal Government for employees that are in team leader, supervisory, management and executive positions. (3) To provide individual development plans for new supervisory and managerial employees as well as incumbent employees in supervisory and managerial positions, and (4) To provide a variety of developmental activities through appropriate training sources.  THE MANAGEMENT PARTNERS PROGRAM - The IBB Management Partners Program (MPP) is a component of the International Broadcasting Bureau's competency-based leadership development program. MPP is designed to enhance the management abilities of high-potential employees so that they might become more effective leaders and pursue senior-level positions. The MPP is based on the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) executive competencies such as partnering, entrepreneurship, service motivation, creativity and innovation, financial management and technology management. Participants will engage in learning teams and studies, group exercises, classroom training and other developmental experiences.  MPP's goal is to provide opportunities for participants to obtain experiential understanding of agency-wide, national and global issues and their impact on IBB's mission and goals so that they can prepare themselves to take on leadership positions in the future.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - The development and delivery of the training shall be coordinated with in-house IBB training specialists. The Training and Development Division will monitor all work done on the resultant contract.  The contractor shall supply all personnel, materials, equipment, transportation, and all other miscellaneous items required to perform work described in this Statement of Work.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS – The Contractor will work with a group of 5-10 participants in this nine (9)-month program.

The development of the eventual successful training and facilitating will be coordinated with in-house IBB training specialists.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only  solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not  be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The  solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in  effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This is a sole source  requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.   This RFQ has the following line item(s): CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE AND INSTALL THE FOLLOWING EQUIPMENT: QTY					DESCRIPTION 1					True Two-Color Offset Press REQUIREMENTS: Three Form Rollers: Each printing unit is computer engineered featuring 16 rollers, 3 ink forms,  each a different diameter, with a segregated fourth water form. V Five Cylinder Design: A five-cylinder design consists of two separate plate cylinders and two  separate blanket cylinders sharing a common double diameter impression  cylinder.  Both colors are printed in one gripper bite of the impression  cylinder providing hair line register from color to color. Separate Water Dampening: 	Each individual printing head has its own segregated water form roller. Vertical and Horizontal Image Adjustment: Each printing unit is equipped with lateral and vertical adjustment dials as  precise as .25 millimeter.  No blanket cleaning is required after adjustments  are made, this increases productivity. Pre-register System: This system assures accurate punching, setting, marking, and mounting of the  masking sheets and plates – metal, paper, or polyester.  This reduces make  ready time and increases productivity. Full Bleed 11” x 17” This size enables the handling of larger format jobs, accepting sheet sizes up  to 13 3/8” x 17 ¾” and printing a maximum image area of 13” x 17 ¼”.  Since  this sheet size allows for a full bleed 11” x 17”; all four sides, it also  provides extra image with plenty of room for register marks and cut lines. Single Lever Operation: Dampening, inking, and image transfer are controlled by a single lever, which  activates the paper feed, and the printing cycle. Preset Sheet Counter: The preset counter automatically shuts off the feed and press once the  programmed number of printed sheets have been completed. Central Lubrication: 	One pull of the oil pump lever lubricates all the major rotating parts  and bearings. Central Microcomputer / Microprocessor Control: This control provides push button control of several press functions, print  speed reset, and paper feed. Paper Feed: Thirteen suction feet combine with air blowers on the pile feed to maintain  accurate paper feeding at low to high speeds.  Handles stock weight from onion  skin to cover weight. Double Sheet Deflector: When a double sheet is detected, it is automatically ejected into a special  deflector tray without interrupting the press run. Jam Detector: Jam detectors are located in six different areas in the press.  If a jam  occurs, the feed is shut down; a light on the display panel will indicate where  the jam occurred allowing for the operator to correct the problem immediately. Reversible Push / Push Sheet Register System Being able to push the sheet from either side, provides the capability of  producing a work and turn job, the reversible push option enables the sheet to  be pushed and gripped from the same end, providing register from front to back. Separate Blankets: Two separate blankets eliminate ink migration that occurs when using a press  with a color head / common blanket.  It also provides ink fidelity when  printing four-color since you are printing a separate layer of ink from each  print tower. Clean-Up Attachments: A clean-up attachment is standard for each print head.  This eliminates the use  of clean-up mats.  It also allows a faster clean-up and change from color to  color. Dual Pallet Feed Tray: This system enables the operator to pre-load paper while the press is feeding  from a second feed tray resulting in continuous paper load and feed. This will be a best value award. The Government will determine the proposal  that provides the most advantageous offer to satisfy the requirements of this  RFQ based on an integrated assessment of each quotation.  This selection will  be based on the criteria below.  The Government reserves the right to award to  other than the contractor with the lowest price.  Besides low price, other  criteria that will be considered include:         1)	Contractor shall provide all the specific equipment listed above. (NO  SUBSTITUTES)  2)	Contractor shall provide installation of the equipment above.   3)	Contractor shall provide training on how to use the equipment listed  above. 4)	Contractor shall pay for the shipping and handling of the equipment  listed above. Ship to: NASIC/SCXA  4165 Communications Road, Bldg. 281, Door 2, Wright- Patterson AFB, OH.  Delivery required within 30 days of award, FOB destination,  and net 30 payment terms.  The following clauses and provisions apply: 52.212- 1, 52.212-3.  Clauses 52.212-4 and 52.212-5 shall be included with any offer.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(2), the Government may award without  discussions. WPAFB intends to award to A B Dick Company 7400 Caldwell  Niles, IL 60714-3806. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required  are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no  other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N00019-04-P-0034 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Change Notice (DCN) 20040513. This action is not set aside for a small business. The applicable NAICS is 336413 and the small business size standard is <500 employees. This is a DO rated order with an assigned rating of A70. This requirement is being procured sole source through Honeywell Defense and Space Electronic Systems (HDSES), Albuquerque, NM.  Required delivery date: within 30 days of date of award. Required period of performance (storage and management): 85 months from date of award. The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters (NAVAIR HQ), Patuxent River MD has a requirement to protect the production and repair capability of the Advanced Mission Computer (AMC) Video Input Module (VIM), of the mission computer for the F/A-18 and AV-8B aircrafts. One commercial part component of the AMC VIM, the Variable – Gain Video Op Amp (Manufactured by Intersil Corporation, Part No. EL4451CS) is to become obsolete. The requirement to protect F/A-18E/F Lots 26 through 29 retrofit and repair support necessitates the procurement of approximately 1,450 each VIM Variable – Gain Video Op Amps. There are no other known parts that meet form, fit, function replacement requirements.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. HDSES is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AMC VIM, as well as the designated repair facility, and as such is the only source capable of procuring these parts to protect the production and repair of the AMC VIM. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price type purchase order will be awarded. All hardware items will ship-in-place at the contractor’s facility; FOB Origin with Inspection and Acceptance at Origin applies.  Inspection and Acceptance of the supplies and services to be furnished hereunder shall be performed at the supplier’s plant, Albuquerque, NM by the cognizant Administrative Contracting officer (ACO) or their duly authorized representative.  The contract line item number and description are: CLIN 0001 Video Input Module (VIM) Variable – Gain Video Op Amp (Manufactured by Intersil Corporation, Part No. EL4451CS) 1,450 each; CLIN 0002 – Program Management Support and Storage of parts; period of performance: 85 months from date of award; 1 Lot, Not Separately Priced (NSP). The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government’s rights under any “Inspection” clause that may be in the contract, nor does it limit the Government’s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this purchase order.   In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.   The Statement of Work for this effort is provided as an attachment to this synopsis/solicitation.  Award is expected to be on or before 17 September 2004.

Currently there is no manufactured equipment capable of the following requirements.   Minimum chamber size of 20"x20"x20" and should be mounted to the top of the Contraves 352 table which has air bearings that could be adversely affected by condensation as well as contributing to loading of the heating/cooling system. The table base shall not be enclosed due to mechanical and environmental specifications.  An extension of the rotational shaft shall enter the thermal chamber from the bottom and have the existing table top, or similar surface, placed inside the chamber.  This extension will affect thermal loads on the chamber due to the interface with the 352 table.	The extension and it’s interface with the chamber shall provide a minimal amount of rotational friction. Capable of providing a stable thermal environment within the range from -20   degrees C to +70 degrees C.  Humidity should remain below dew point levels at the requested range of temperatures and should never reach above 70%.  Assume that equipment under test inside the chamber will be 10 lb. of aluminum with a power dissipation of 15 Watts Temperature pull down rate of 20 degrees C per hour, pull up rate of 60 degrees per hour.  Mechanical refrigeration is preferred as long as moving parts would be placed at a distance of 15' with lines running at ceiling level (9' above floor level). Forced air cooling would be considered as a negative impact on award judgment. Installation sight is within 15 feet of AC Power; 220VAC at 30 Amps and 115V at 15 Amps are available.	Higher amperage requirements will be taken into consideration.	There is no water supply or drain line in the vicinity of the rate table.  Expected temperature control/resolution and accuracy expected for temperature setting – resolution of less than ½ degree F; accuracy to +/- 1 degree F. Ambient atmosphere will be air. Thermal loading will be limited to the tables rotating surface and associated leak paths.  Also, instruments mounted on the table will dissipate up to 40 watts when isolated from the table, 15 watts not isolated.  The locations ambient conditions are between 70 and 75 degrees F, year round with a humidity of 30 to 70 percent.  The chamber shall remain free of condensation during operation. Dimensions of the Model 352 tilt axis pillow blocks - Table base is 43” in diameter and maximum width is 50” and table height of 45 ½” inches.	Other items extend higher and can be seen in the photos provided.   On site installation required to be performed by contractor.   Interior delivery constraints include 58" doorways and a 66" hallway with turns  Expected delivery A.R.O.is 6 months.  Handling instructions and necessary support should be stated in the proposal.

<DESC>Questions and Answer on Solicitaiton No. H92239-04-T-0047  CASA 212 Mock-Up

1) Is the CASA212-100 aircraft to be simulated available for a hands-on review prior to proposal due date? 

Answer:  No.  We expect the contract to have sufficient expertise in CASA 212's to provide their own model for comparison.  This is not a specialized or niche capability we are referring to.

2) Solicitation Item 1a states that the trainer shall be towable but does not state the conditions that the device will be subject to when being towed, such that an appropriate design can be proposed. At what speeds and terrain type will the device be towed?

Answer:  Trainer should be equipped for towing by an LMTV and a civilian equivalent for trailer hitch compatibility.  It should be towable over improved dirt roads at speeds not exceeding 25 mph and over main, paved roads at speeds not to exceed 45 mph.

3) Solicitation Item 1c states that the ramp should allow for opening and closing during rehearsal. How does the ramp operate in the aircraft? Is duplication of the aircraft operability required in the trainer or is a manually operated ramp desired?

Answer:  Request that the ramp be mechanically vice manually opened and closed.  This can be done through a combination of electrical and hydraulic engineering.  Recommend duplicating the system in real CASA 212s.  Again, not our job to be aviation experts.  How the ramp operates is a research point incumbent on the contractor building this device.

4) The aircraft has an upper ramp that, when opened, appears to create a ledge 2 meters above the ramp surface that extends aftward, and could impose a height constraint to the jumper. Does the trainer need to have a feature to simulate the upper ramp?

Answer:  Absolutely.  This is a non-negotiable element of the mock up.  All elements that restrict movement inside a real CASA 212 must be simulated in the mock up.

5) Please clarify the last statement in Solicitation Item 1c, that the fuselage must be inspected for cuts and damage and repaired as appropriate. 

Answer:  The simulator must be inspected for cuts and damage and repaired in order to prevent harm to personnel and equipment.  Any damage that presents a sharp edge that could hurt a soldier or tear equipment  must be repaired.

6) There is no requirement for ambient lighting. Please confirm that this is the case.

Answer:  Correct.  No requirement for ambient lighting.

7) Solicitation Item 1e states that the jump bell and jump light system must be installed, and that the location of the switches and battery are to be determined. Please confirm the inference that the training device will be powered by a 12 volt DC battery without means to recharge the battery.

Answer:  As long as the device has DC power source, we do not care what kind of battery is employed as long as it is COTS accessible and non-proprietary.

Q:  What is the desired delivery date of Product?
A:  Request delivery NLT 1 November 2004.
 
Q:  Is this a close resemblance to interior only or exterior as well?
A:  Resemblance to interior is essential.  Resemblance to exterior is desired for the fuselage.  This provides a more realistic simulation for jumpmasters doing door checks.
 
Q:  Which Troop seat do you desire? New or used? Side mounted, nine each side? Do you have a contractor that makes those seats that you would prefer us to use or would refer us to?
A:  We don't care if the seats are new or used.  We need storable bench seats as currently used by the USASOC CASA aircraft.  As for who makes these seats....we have no idea.
 
Q:  Will this mock-up be lifted into the air or just remain static on ground?
A:  The CASA must be towable by an LMTV or civilian equivalent.  It will not be lifted into the air.
 
Q:  Do you have special authorized ferry permits or we take care of that for transportation?
A:  Contractor must take care of transportation to this unit.  Movement after acceptance will be coordinated internally.
 
Q:  Do you want the ramp to operate on manual open/close or automated?
A:  Automated.  The ramp must also simulate the reduced opening presented by the upper ramp.
 
Q:  Do you want windows in the fuselage?
A:  Yes.  The windows should simulate those in a real CASA.
 
Q:  Do the jump lights and safety cord need to be exact military equipment or can we create a close facsimile and can you provide us with a contact for the equipment manufacturer to acquire?
A:  A close facsimile is acceptable as long as positioning and dimensions are the same as in a real CASA.  The equipment manufacturer is well beyond our lane of knowledge.

Closing Date/Due Date of Solicitation is hereby extended to No-Later-Than (NLT) 2:00 p.m. EDST 13 August 2004.

This acquisition is set aside for small business. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Services (NESDIS), International & Interagency Affairs Office (IA) has a requirement for Support For Earth Imaging Satellite Tool Database. NOAA/NESDIS/IA has procured a satellite information management tool to provide information on the variety of land remote sensing data available from both civil and commercial satellites worldwide. For additional information see http://commavail.noaa.gov/controlcenter.cfm. This database is a catalog containing both existing satellites and proposed satellites. The information in the database is solely from public source information. NOAA is interested in information that will updated as required by events as a continuing function so that it can be relied upon as NOAA’s basic information resource of all Earth Observing Satellite Programs, including U.S. Government, domestic, foreign, and commercial. The contractor shall perform the following four tasks to update the NOAA Satellite Information Tool.

TASK 1.  UPDATING INFORMATION WITHIN THE DATABASE
a) The Contractor shall survey the existing Satellite Information Tool database and immediately begin to update the information within the database. The Contractor shall be responsible for all updates to the existing database, both from a substantive and technical perspective, to be performed on a bi-monthly basis. b) For obtaining information for the database updates, the Contractor shall use only publicly available information. c) The Contractor shall be responsible for updating existing database records and fields within individual records, as well as, providing new records to the database as a new land remote sensing satellite mission information becomes available. d) The Contractor shall insert the updated satellite mission information into the database. The Contractor shall travel to NOAA facilities in Silver Springs, Maryland, as necessary, to perform the database updates. e) The Contractor shall provide  written reports to NOAA/NESDIS/IA as to what information is being added or updated.
