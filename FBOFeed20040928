<DESC>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for a worldwide support services contract to support the Criminal Division's International Criminal Investigations Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).  Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, and materials necessary to perform the required functions consistent with applicable policies, regulations, procedures, business practices, and protocols that define the ICITAP operational environment.  ICITAP works closely with other agencies of the United States Government including the National Security Council (NSC), the U.S. State Department (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to transform and develop foreign criminal justice systems in a variety of environments including those commonly described as:  (1) Post conflict, such as was/is the case in El Salvador, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo,  Timor Leste, Afghanistan and Iraq; (2) Emerging democracies, such as Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan  and South Africa; (3) Failed states, such as Somalia and Haiti; and (4) States in transition, such as Mexico, Nicaragua and Argentina .  ICITAP currently operates projects in a total of thirty seven (37) foreign countries. Major developmental and reform work is underway in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, El Salvador, Indonesia, Iraq, Kosovo, Macedonia, Nigeria and Pakistan.  Some of the countries in which supplies and services are needed operate in a cash-only economy; thus, the Contractor may be required to provide large sum cash advances to persons employed or subcontracted under this contract to pay travel and subsistence costs.  The bulk of the development/reform work performed by ICITAP can be separated into four broad categories:  (1)  Technical Assistance; (2)  Training; (3)  Equipment Donation; and (4)  Construction.  The Government anticipates a base period of twelve months for the resultant contract with five additional option periods of one year each for a total period of performance of seventy-two (72) months.  An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract is anticipated.  The solicitation will be available on or about October 13, 2004.  A pre-proposal conference will be held approximately one week after release of the solicitation with a due date for receipt of proposals approximately thirty-five (35) days after issuance of the solicitation.  All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Service Administration's "Federal Business Opportunities" web site, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation itself will not be available.  Interested parties should periodically check this Internet site for information regarding the schedule and this acquisition.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to solicit and award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Montana State University, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Bozeman, Montana, for research and testing on the effects of atomic oxygen (AO) on POSS (Polyhedral Oligomericsilsesquioxane) Polyimide (PI) films.  This work will include the exposure of at least 12 batches of POSS PI film up to 8 samples per batch to a well-characterized AO source with AO flux and vacuum conditions representative of the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) environment with the erosion yield characterization of a minimum of 10 samples.  Besides an AO source, the utilized vacuum chamber must also have an available UV/VUV source and a sample holder that can maintain various temperatures comparable to the space environment.  Previous AO source characterization must be completed showing at least 70% atomic oxygen with translational energies of approximately 5 eV. Previous work in determining erosion yields due to AO exposure, atomic force microscopy imaging of samples after AO exposure, and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy must be referenced.  Due to the volume of samples to be studied over an 8-month period, experience in AO exposure of POSS Polyimides and subsequent characterization is required. This award cannot be used for equipment purchases. Reports of test results require a written description of activities along with all XPS data, erosion yield plots, and AFM images.  Disclosure of information derived from this award to foreign nationals is restricted. This acquisition is unrestricted. The NAICS code is 541710, FSC/SVC-AC21. Size standard 1,000.

The Air Force is not making this award a competitive procurement because Montana State University’s (MSU) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has demonstrated a unique capability to provide the particular research services proposed. This facility is the only know facility that combines a source well characterized along with the ability to study the synergistic and separate effects of UV/VUV (vacuum ultraviolet radiation) at various temperatures and with consistency in achieving results in a timely fashion. MSU has demonstrated expertise in POSS Polyimide AO erosion studies with subsequent erosion yield determination.  Only MSU has shown the correlation of calculated erosion yields and root mean square roughness of POSS Polyimide film surfaces after AO exposure with atomic force microscopy imaging of POSS Polyimides surfaces.  Experience with these studies is critical to the program.  A candidate without this experience would require a number of additional experiments and an indefinite time to approach this level of expertise.  

Parties interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government’s requirements.  In addition, the response should include any special requirements for a Research and Development contract (i.e., patent rights, data, scientific and technical reports, insurance, etc.) in accordance with FAR Part 35. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation for consideration.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responsible responses received within 15 days of the publication of this notice.  A determination by the Air Force not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Facsimile responses are acceptable and must be received on or before the closing date.  Telephone requests to be placed on a mailing list will not be honored. Anticipated Award date is 18 Oct 2004.

Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 13 Oct 2004.  Responses should be submitted to:  Directorate of Contracting, AFFTC/PKT (Attn: Dwight Franke) 5 So. Wolfe Avenue, Building 2800, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Fax: (661) 275-7869, or Email dwight.franke@edwards.af.mil

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Aircraft Operations Center, Mac Dill AFB, FL has a requirement for engineering services to develop a detailed engineering specification for the Airborne Atmospheric Measurement and Profiling Systems (AAMPS). AAMPS is a scalable system that can be utilized in varying capacities, by any of the heavy and light aircrafts that are flown by NOAA/AOC. The AAMPS efforts has been broken down into five sub-projects: 1) Configurable AAMPS Module (CAM), 2) Data Recording, Processing and Distribution, 3) Data Video Distribution and Display, 4) Network Infrastructure, and 5) User-Net (network client display workstations, printing, data storage, etc) The scope of this effort is limited to the Data Recording, Processing, and Distribution sub-project of the AAMPS effort.  The Data Recording, Processing, and Distribution sub-project involves development of a Main Data Station (MDS), including computer hardware and operating system acquisition and integration, application software development and documentation. The MDS shall primarily employ commercial computing equipment and open source operating systems to be integrated into the overall AAMPS deployment by mid-2005.  The data processing tasks involve filtering and averaging of raw data that will result in at least 1Hz data. Also, these tasks will involve converting the raw data to engineering and scientific units using second and third order calibration constants and user supplied equations to derive scientific parameters.  The entire processed data-set will be made available to other MDS software applications by way of system memory, local files, or a combination thereof. A graphical operator interface will be required that will allow for on-the-fly modifications to the data processing tasks. The MDS development effort will provide application support, which enables multiple networked clients to graphically view the processed data in real-time. The envisioned application will be web-based and will support at least three computer platform types-Linux, MS Windows, and Macintosh. All interested parties may request a copy of the RFQ by referencing No. NAAN6000-5-00104SLW. The RFQ will be available on or about October 11, 2004. This is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 513390. The Central Administrative Support Center (CASC), Acquisition Management Division (AMD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) before October 1, 2003.  After this date, NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.  A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  Any questions should be directed to Sharon L. Walker, Contract Specialist at 816-426-7267 x241 or by fax at (816) 426-7530.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters Office of Education, Higher Education Division, announces a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) soliciting proposals to develop and coordinate the NASA Science and Technology Scholarship Program (STSP). The STSP is a competitive scholarship program intended to guide U.S. students toward NASA-related science and engineering careers. The program will provide tuition scholarships to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, of diverse geographic and demographic backgrounds, enrolled in accredited institutions of higher education (university, college, or community college) degree programs in engineering, science, and other technology fields. As outlined in the Vision for Space Exploration, the NASA Strategic Plan, and the NASA Education Enterprise Strategy of 2003, a strategic goal of NASA’s mission is “to inspire and motivate students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.” STSP is a focused program to attract the “best and brightest” science and engineering students into the NASA workforce. In exchange for tuition scholarships and research stipend support, STSP students must agree to fulfill a service obligation following graduation.  An appropriated funding level of $7.5M has been established for the initial year of the NASA Science and Technology Scholarship Program. The appropriation includes scholarship funding support of up to $20,000 per academic year per student, up to $10,000 annually per student to support the applicable research internships and activities both at a designated host NASA Center and at the participant’s institution, as well as STSP administrative costs. NASA anticipates continuing support for this program for one full program cycle, contingent on the availability of funds, progress, and continued relevance to the NASA mission. An STSP program cycle is estimated to take 30 months to complete. The authority to establish the STSP is provided to NASA in the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004 (http://nasapeople.nasa.gov/hclwp/index.htm). This legislation establishes, and will guide, STSP participant eligibility criteria, scholarship funding, retention requirements, service obligations, and penalties for non-completion and non-compliance. However, NASA retains flexibility regarding the development of program infrastructure, management and administration that will ultimately determine the success of this initiative. These areas are the focus of this solicitation.  Organizations or consortia of organizations interested in collaborating with NASA to develop and coordinate a competitive, high-quality, national undergraduate scholarship-for-service program are invited to submit proposals. Participation in the STSP is open to all categories of domestic organizations, including universities and colleges, professional societies, industry, nonprofit institutions, and academic organizations. Proposals from entities outside the United States will not be considered. For this solicitation, the provisions contained in the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook apply to both non-profit and commercial organizations. Pursuant to section 1260.4(b)(2) of the Handbook NASA does not allow for payment of profit or fee to commercial firms under this award. NASA plans to award one (1) cooperative agreement as a result of this solicitation. The agreement is scheduled to be awarded not later than November 2004, and will continue for one full program cycle.  More information on STSP can be found at: http://education.nasa.gov/divisions/higher/overview/F_pathfinder_scholarship.html. The anticipated release date of the CAN is September 28, 2004. Proposals must be received by 4:30 PM Eastern Time, October 28, 2004. Proposals received after the announced deadline will not be considered. In addition to paper submission and a complete electronic copy on CD-ROM or ZIP disk, a proposal cover page must be submitted electronically through the SYS-EYFUS system. Electronic submission does not take the place of the required paper submission.  The STSP solicitation will be available on the NASA Headquarters Web site: http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_n/nra/current/NNH04ZNH002C/index.html. The Point of Contact for questions regarding the Cooperative Agreement and the extent of NASA contribution is: Katie Blanding University Affairs Officer Office of Education NASA Headquarters Washington, D.C. 20546 Telephone: 202-358-0402 FAX: 202-358-3032 Email: katie.blanding@nasa.gov This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 6.102 (d) (2). Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Constantin Balasoiu, General Manager, SC Complexul Energetic Craiova SA (CEN),101 Mihai Viteazul Street; Isalnita 207340, Dolj, Romania; Phone: +40-0251-407-681; Fax: +40-0251-594-837; Email: cen@termo.oltenia.ro  
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a new flue gas desulfurization unit at the Craiova II combined heat and power plant in southern Romania.

CEN is the major producer of electric power in the city of Craiova, an industrial center in southern Romania.  Until recently the company was part of SA Termoelectrica, the national thermal power generation monopoly.  CEN became an independent state owned enterprise in April 2004.  The company has three major assets: the Isalnita thermal power plant, the Craiova II combined heat and power plant, and the Ruget open pit lignite mine.  Because both power plants fail to meet specific sulfur dioxide emissions requirements, CEN has decided to rehabilitate each power plant, starting with the Craiova II plant.

The Craiova II power plant has two 150 MW power blocks and eight heat-only boilers.  The plant provides heat for the city’s district heating system.  Both of the power blocks at Craiova were designed to meet the prevailing Eastern European emissions standards at the time of their construction in 1987 and 1989.  In 2001, the European Parliament set new limits for emissions from large combustion plants.  Under the new regulations, plants such as Craiova II must limit sulfur dioxide emissions or achieve a desulfurization rate of at least 94%.  Sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants have been linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain.  Acid rain can have a significant effect on regional agriculture, including loss of crops, diminished water quality, and damage to buildings.   

While the Craiova II plant has made pollution upgrades in the past using moderately effective equipment, CEN has determined that in order to remain in operation and meet European Union (EU) directives, Craiova II must reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 94%.  This will require the installation of a flue gas desulfurization system.  A flue gas desulfurization unit is an air pollution control process that uses a spray of water and finely ground limestone to remove gaseous pollutants from stack gasses.  When the sulfur dioxide and the limestone combine, they form gypsum, a common mineral that can be used to make wall board or disposed of as a non-hazardous land fill material.  The only obstacle to Craiova’s long-term utilization is the absence of a sulfur dioxide removal system. 

The purpose of this feasibility study is to assess the technical and economic aspects of a new flue gas desulfurization unit at the Craiova II combined heat and power plant in southern Romania.  The aim of the Terms of Reference (TOR) is to develop 1) a conceptual design for the installation of a flue gas desulfurization system; 2) a preliminary environmental impact assessment; and, 3) an economic and financial analysis.  

Note:  In order to fulfill the TOR for this Study a local subcontractor may be necessary.   The Grantee has stated its preference for a local subcontractor, and suggests that the Institute for Studies and Power Engineering (ISPE) of Romania serve as the local subcontractor for this Study.  The Contractor may wish to subcontract with ISPE in order to fulfill the TOR.   The subcontract should not exceed $34,000 and may be paid by the Contractor from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) Grant Funds.  A notional budget for the subcontract is included in Annex 6 of the Request for Proposals (RFP).  The details of the TOR and budget for the subcontract will be determined during contract negotiations between the Contractor and the selected subcontractor. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $415,430 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed RFP, which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m., October 29, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source subscription renewal contract to Cloudmark, to provide anti-SPAM capability for the General Services Administration Groupware and Electronic and Messaging Team.  The GSA IT Acquisition Services center plans to negotiate with Cloudmark to renew an existing subscription currently being provided to the Groupware and Electronic Messaging Team for anti-Spam services, whose proprietary capability uses spamDNA to identify whether or not an email is spam or legitimate.  While other solutions in the market place catch spam emails, they rely on rules an/or heuristic techniques or groups of rules, and by nature are  “reactive” to keeping up with various forms of spam.  Cloudmark, on the other hand, provides the only capability that can identify spam using the “genetic properties” (such as terminology contained in the “subject text” of a message or terminology contained in the “to” field of the message, etc.) of messages and can make predictive determinations as to what is spam or legitimate.  The other products reactively write a new rule for every strain of spam.  For example, instead of waiting for a new rule to be created, the proprietary capability of SpamDNA allows Cloudmark  to scan the properties of the message to determine proactively if the message is spam.  On the basis of the Cloudmark proprietary SpamDNA capability, a greater quantity of spam messages are screened using a minimal amount of time.  The period of performance is for one base year, with two, one-year option periods to be exercised at the Government’s discretion [FAR 52.232-19, Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, applicable].  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to business and technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-04-R-RS08. 
1.  Responses are hereby provided to the following Technical and business questions: Question 1) Reference RFP Section L-12, page 25.  The referenced section does not state a size/page count restriction for any resultant proposal.  Is there a size/page count restriction? If so, what?  Answer 1) In accordance with RFP Section L-12(2), there is no size/page count restriction on any proposal submitted against this RFP.   Question 2)  Reference RFP Section L-5, page 22, and Section H-3, page 9.  Section L-5 indicates that the Government anticipates award of a CPFF Term Contract, and Section H-3 indicates a Level of Effort Contract.  Should L-5 read CPFF-LOE Term Contract? Answer 2)  No. The definition of a CPFF Term-Type Contract is provided at FAR 16.306(d).  By regulation, a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract may take one of only two forms – completion or term.  The phrase "Level of Effort" does not refer to a contract type. Rather, a specified level-of-effort for a stated period of time is a mandatory sub-element for a CPFF Term-type contract.   
Question 3) Reference RFP Section H-3 (k) and the Projected LOE Table, both on page 11.  Please explain the following apparent discrepancy. Paragraph (k) states that the Offeror may assume that the estimated number of hours is equally distributed to each of the base and option years.  The projected LOE Table, however, has a more realistic estimate of the hours for each year. Answer 3)  Paragraph (k) to RFP Section H-3 – Level of Effort, is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "The anticipated breakdown by labor category of the total level of effort is as follows:"     Question 4) Reference RFP Attachment 2 – Personnel Requirements.  Our experience indicates that the Technician should be on-site rather than the Machinist.  Answer 4) Contract Attachment 2 is hereby revised to state that the Machinist shall be off-site while the Technician shall be on-site.   Question 5) Given that October 11 is a holiday, we hereby request extension of the RFP closing date from 12 OCT 2004 to 19 OCT 2004.  Answer 5) The Closing Date for RFP Number N00173-04-R-RS08 is hereby extended to 3:30 p.m. local time, 19 OCT 2004.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) – Office for Law Enforcement Standards (OLES) seek sources for commercial chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) respiratory protective equipment.  Product information will be used to revise and update the existing Guide for the Selection of Personal Protective Equipment for Emergency Responders, DHS (formerly NIJ) Guide 102-00 published in November 2002.  

This equipment is intended to protect emergency responders and others from inhalation hazards that could be faced during a terrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  The respiratory protective equipment categories of interest include open circuit self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR), air-purifying respirators (APR, or gas masks), escape respirators, and combination systems such as SCBA/PAPR.  

This Sources Sought Request is intended to identify respiratory protective equipment and products that are certified to specific Federal performance standards.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – National Personal Protection Technology Laboratory (NIOSH-NPPTL) has the Federal mandate to lead development and issuance of CBRN Respirator Standards.  To date, the CBRN-SCBA, CBRN-SCBA Upgrades, CBRN-APR (gas mask), and CBRN-Escape Respirator standards have been issued, and products have or are being certified to these NIOSH standards.  

Manufacturers should submit product information only on respiratory protective equipment that is either currently certified or intended to be submitted for certification to these NIOSH CBRN standards.  For PAPR and combinations systems, information may be submitted on products that will be submitted for NIOSH certification process when the NIOSH CBRN standard is formally released.  

The Government will review the manufacturer’s product design and performance information and specifications to determine if the submitter’s equipment will be included in the revised Guide.  

SUBMISSION OF DATA.  Product information submitted in response to this notice must be submitted to the Responder Knowledge Base (RKB), where it will be kept on-line for access by the responder community.  Submitters should contact Lesley Zareh (see below), and will be provided with instructions and administrative access to the RKB for the purpose of data submission and maintenance.  The RKB is available on-line at http://www.rkb.mipt.org.  This survey announcement is intended to identify existing mature products (commercial off-the-shelf).  Interested sources shall ensure that their information is submitted on-line not later 
than November 30, 2004.  NOTE: Eligible products that have already been submitted to the RKB will automatically be included in the eligibility determination process for the revised Guide.  However, vendors should check existing records for accuracy and completeness prior to the submission deadline.

AFRL Program Manager: Capt. Brian Yoshimoto, email Brian.Yoshimoto@rl.af.mil, 315/330-3385; Alternate: Jon S. Jones, e-mail Jon.Jones@rl.af.mil 315/330-1665; Technical Points of Contact: Steve Scott, email steve.scott@rl.af.mil, 315/330-4414; Contracting Officer: Lori L. Smith, email Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil; 315-330-1955.   The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) in cooperation with the Space Based Radar Joint Program Office (SBR JPO) is seeking innovative solutions for the reduction of risk associated with the development, deployment, and operation of the Battle Management Command Control and Communications (BMC3) segment of a Space-Based Radar (SBR) system. This effort is intended to directly support the activities of the Space-Based Radar program and compliment its ongoing system definition and risk reduction activities.     Several significant efforts are currently underway.  These include the System Concept Analysis task order executed via the Engineering, Analysis, Design and Development (EADDII) contract (awarded in December 2002) the ongoing SBR On-Board-Processor (OBP) and the Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) contracted activities that are planned to continue through 2003.  Results of this effort may influence the design of the SBR Concept of Operations, OBP design, ESA design, and system design.  Additionally, it is expected that significant insight to total system architecture and its performance will be gained through this activity by enhancing understanding of issues associated with reducing risk for as well as developing SBR BMC3 solutions.  Due to the long lead-time to develop OBP and ESA, the SBR JPO is particularly interested in BMC3 design trade implications impacting these areas.  This SBR System will consist of a satellite constellation with a multi-mode radar producing Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and High Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) products.  This SBR BMC3 Risk Reduction BAA will focus on the following technology areas: 1) Collection Management including dynamic tasking from CONUS and theater, 2) Information Management, and 3) Combat Operations Products including GMTI, SAR imagery, Combat Identification, and multi-intelligence products taking into consideration tasking, cueing and fusion with other sensor modalities such as SIGINT and air sensors.  In the area of Collection Management, developments allowing the dynamic retasking of a satellite sensor from theatre in a timely, assured, secure, and robust manner are required. This area will explore different conceptual architectures, and their associated technologies to satisfy national and tactical users needs for satellite sensor retasking and timely notification of status. Tasking functions must also provide the capability task data archives to retrieve the appropriate data to do machine-level change detection in support of theater situational awareness.  Objectives include defining the technical requirements for mission management and defining notional mission management architectures. This includes a study of available applications for satellite retasking, SBR resource allocation techniques, and available applications suitable for use in satellite retasking, such as track waveform scheduling, track loss/stop verification, track restart with continuity of identification, interrupted imaging modes, etc.  Offerors must consider satellite orbits, including orientations that provide repeated views from the same look angle to provide additional SAR change detection capability, handoffs, gap times, coverage areas, revisit times, resolution, sensor modes available, task prioritization, etc. and notification of reprioritized task list to all potential interested users. In addition, other advanced modes such as passive ESM, X-band communications, and low power ocean surveillance modes should be considered.  Offerors must consider event detection, activity level measurements, correlated movement of units, and ship tracking in their proposals.  Ground processing must consider machine bulk filtering of data, SAR change detection and GMTI level of activity monitoring.  In the area of Information Management (IM), support of BMC3 for SBR will be a critical factor for determining tactical Tasking, Posting, Processing, and Using (TPPU) alternatives, national Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) alternatives, and CONOPS alternatives system design tradeoffs. This area will characterize IM technologies in terms of SBR BMC3 risk areas and summarize SBR requirements drivers for IM. In particular, after performing ground processing, the SBR system of systems must archive (post), catalog, and facilitate rapid database query, and dissemination of information to the user community. Development of an integrated and interoperable architecture for theater and national information management is the goal. This includes an assessment of technical requirements for this architecture, identification of technical deficiencies in data warehousing and data mining, and prototyping an implementation of national and tactical information management architectures and activities such as autonomous meta-data capture mechanisms, characterization of intelligent agents to process meta-data, and peer-to-peer mechanisms for information exchange. Some consideration should be given to appropriate meta-data descriptors, such as pedigree, and data-derived products.  The area of Combat Operations Products has been identified as high risk and requires additional technical development. Current GMTI, SAR exploitation techniques are manual, operator intensive, based on single or multiple airborne sensor concepts, and very limited. In addition, utilizing a satellite constellation with rapidly changing viewing angles and varying sensor performance attributes has not been fully explored, and therefore, requires development, testing, and analysis. Furthermore, software must combine the data from these satellite sensors into meaningful products. This area will develop the necessary extensions to current ground tracking algorithms to support the expected characteristics of a space-based radar constellation. Items of interest include extensions to existing capabilities and development of new feature-based classification approaches for SBR to support classification and track maintenance. Particular attention will be focused on developing algorithms and analyses for the use of selected feature data such as High Range Resolution (HRR), Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), and Micro-Doppler techniques to perform long-term track maintenance. These tools must be integrated with the synoptic machine-level processes described previously.  Efforts under this BAA will provide prototype algorithms to enable the fusion of resources for the timely detection, track, and identification of ground moving targets. These efforts will also leverage existing developments in the operational area such as Moving Target Information Exploitation (MTIX) and develop on those architectures making it easily adaptable to existing architectures for technology transition.     SBR Measures of Performance (MOPs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) need to be developed and integrated into these new concepts. This will provide the methodology for consistent system evaluation.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking capabilities from small, small-disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses (including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Other Minority Educational Institutions) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for a future requirement.	NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for performance to compete the formulation and implementation phase of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)  The acquisition of GLM will follow a phased development strategy and will include two major phases:  Formulation and Implementation. The work completed under the Formulation Phase will provide a foundation for the future Implementation Phase and will be used as the foundation for the contract to be awarded following the successful Formulation completion.  During the Formulation Phase, the contractor will complete Systems Requirements Analysis, System Trade Studies, Systems Requirements Baseline, and Conceptual Design of a GLM instrument.  The GLM is being developed to 1) Provide continuous, full disk lightning measurements for storm warning and nowcasting; 2) Provide longer warning of tornadic activity; and 3) Accumulate a long term database to track decadal changes.  The Formulation Phase encompasses both technical and program management effort.	The following Trade Studies will be required, as a minimum, during the Formulation Phase:	1)  Requirements Analysis, System Configuration and Coverage Trade Study; 2) Zones of Reduced Data Quality Study; 3) Yaw Flip Accommodation; 4) Additional trade studies as proposed by the Contractor.   The Implementation Phase will cover all efforts required to complete the development of the Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) “R” series.  The GOES-R series goes beyond the GOES-I and GOES-N series.  Imagery and sounding data will be collected with significantly improved spatial and spectral resolution at faster coverage rates over comparable or larger areas.	More complete coverage of weather events, including sounding through clouds, remains a goal of the GOES-R satellite.  Geosynchronous lightning measurements will be provided for the first time.  The oceans category will contain requirements on coasts and oceans.  The GOES-R will include solar and space requirements that contain the need for the current Space Environment Monitoring capability, as well as additional solar and energetic particle monitoring in earth’s magnetosphere.	There will be an evolving document updated after the Formulation Phase is concluded.  The GOES-R series of satellites will be controlled from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facilities on the ground.  The mission will provide data and products until the year 2025. NASA anticipates issuance of the final Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about 1/14/2005, for the acquisition of the Formulation Phase Contract, with proposals due 30 days later.  The acquisition will be conducted as a two-phased procurement using a progressive competition down-selection technique between phases, per NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation 1852.217-72.  Notwithstanding NASA’s expectation that only the Formulation Phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the Implementation Phase, all proposals will be considered.  The government anticipates that up to two contractors will be selected for a fixed-price Formulation Phase contract.	To be considered for the Implementation Phase award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the Formulation Phase contractors.  This demonstration shall include the elements of the Formulation Phase deliverables upon which the Implementation Phase award will be based. The government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541330 and $4.0M, respectively.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  Two copies of capability statements shall be submitted to NASA GSFC, Code 210.6, Greenbelt, MD  20771, Attn:  Lori Levine (tel:  301.286.2533, e-mail:  Lori.M.Levine@nasa.gov, fax:  301.286.0383) on or before 10/15/04.  To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one-page summary shall be affixed to the front of the capability statement submitted which identifies for the evaluator, by page and paragraph, your company’s relevant capability.  It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.	Statements must address specifically the capabilities to support the GLM Formulation and/or Implementation Phase.  Additionally, respondents shall provide to the government, the name, address, point of contact, and telephone number of at least three current customers in which similar research and development services have or are being provided.  Capability statements should not contain company-sensitive information. Questions regarding this notice or this procurement should be directed to the Contracting Officer Lori Levine at the phone number or e-mail address listed above.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for the information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.

In addition to tailoring the FR system(s) to meet the Department's needs, the company selected will be required to install and maintain the system(s), as well as to update the system(s) periodically to the evolving state-of-the-art.  Biometric technology is required by the Department to meet mandates in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  Information on terminology and the performance of commercial FR systems may be obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Website for the Face Recognition Vendor Test-2002.  (See http://www.frvt.org.)

The FR system(s) may be required to do some, or all, of the following: 

a.  Provide one-to-many automated face matching (the term ‘many’ in this context may be interpreted to mean from at least 30 million face images or templates in the database),
b.  Provide one-to-one automated face matching, and
c.  Generate statistical reports from the data captured.

As the first step in this process, if your company would like to be considered to receive the Request for Quotation (RFQ) for this effort, please respond to this announcement.  Your “letter of interest” response should be less than two pages long and should describe your company’s experience with and knowledge of FR or other biometric systems, with particular emphasis on applications in government and those involving one-to-many matching.  Include within your “letter of interest” the following information:  (1) name and address of company; (2) ownership (including Country of Ownership and indicating whether your company is Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), or Women-Owned); (3) two points of contact, including: name, title, phone, fax, and e-mail address; (4) name of COTS FR software system(s) being considered for this opportunity; (5) a list of customers for which relevant biometric work has been performed during the past five years, including a summary of work performed, type of biometric, biometric software package(s) used, and a customer point of contact with phone number (this information is required to verify company’s performance; the government may contact any reference for further validation). 

The Department expects to award a contract to one company.  To ensure that companies possess qualifications that would enable them to be competitive within the requirements of this procurement, and to limit the number of Offerors that prepare RFQ responses, the government, working with its contractor (Mitretek Systems, Inc.), will conduct a preliminary selection following receipt of letters of interest to this announcement. 

Up to twenty companies will be selected to respond to a Request for Quotation.  Based on an evaluation of these responses, up to three companies will be selected to submit their offered COTS FR system(s) for laboratory testing by the Department of State and its contractor (Mitretek Systems, Inc.).  Based on the evaluation of these three offered COTS FR system(s), and other submitted documentation, a company will be selected.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  All interested respondents are required to be American Owned.  Responses received that do not include all requested information will be considered non-responsive.  The Government may or may not act upon any information received.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement, or any follow-up information requests.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.

<SUBJECT>D--Intent to Sole Source to Noetics Inc
<DESC>GovWorks on behalf of the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) intends on awarding a sole source contract to Noetics Inc of McLean Virginia.  CAA is acquiring services in the form of continued development and maintenance of the Mobilization Capabilities Evaluation Model (MOBCEM).  The Mobilization Capabilities Evaluation Model (MOBCEM) is a complex software system developed for the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) to simulate the assembly, training, cross-leveling, readiness preparation, and mobilization of Army units for deployment. Major processes of the mobilization system represented in MOBCEM include: reception, billeting, messing, administrative processing, unit and individual combat readiness evaluation, medical/dental checks, soldier readiness preparation (SRP), organizational clothing and individual equipment (OCIE) issue, cross-leveling of personnel and equipment, training, loading, unloading, and unit validation. Major factors to be evaluated include station roles, station capacities, facilities, service areas, unit personnel by grade and military occupational specialty (MOS), unit equipment by line item number (LIN), depot equipment inventories, periodic personnel replenishment, and unit mobilization paths. Noetics has provided direct support to CAA for MOBCEM for the last five years under CAA guidance to simulate many different aspects of the mobilization process, with discrete-event algorithms for processing units, unit prioritization, C-rating evaluation, combat readiness evaluation, cross-leveling of equipment and personnel, and substitution of personnel by MOS and grade, and equipment substitution by LIN.  This evolution has made MOBCEM a unique and valuable analytic tool for CAA studies, but has increased the complexity of all its major software components.  Noetics generates some of the code by a unique process called auto-coding using code generator tools that are not part of the MOBCEM system itself.  Noetics, Inc. has been the developer working with CAA to revise and implement the current MOBCEM software package. Noetics is directly familiar with all aspects of the database, model code, interfaces to external systems, and the scenario data itself, and Noetics has provided ongoing training for CAA personnel and immediate onsite assistance for CAA analytic requirements. Because of the limited budget of the proposed task order, the complexity and extended scope of the existing MOBCEM software, the short delivery time needed for implementing specific new features, and the requirement for immediate expertise in the MOBCEM algorithms and code, GovWorks intends to award a sole source task order to Noetics for continued maintenance and extension of the MOBCEM software. The use of Noetics in a sole source contract is a logical follow on and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Intended award date is October 11, 2004 and the total project length is estimated at 12 months. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any questions regarding this effort should be directed to Mr. Alan Rumney, Contracting Specialist by email at Alan.Rumney@mms.gov or by phone at 703-787-1329.

<SUBJECT>D--Intent to Sole Source to Noetics Inc.
<DESC>GovWorks on behalf of the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) intends on awarding a sole source contract to Noetics Inc of McLean Virginia.  CAA is acquiring services in the form of continued development and maintenance of the Global Deployment Analysis System (GDAS).  The Global Deployment Analysis System (GDAS) is a complex software system designed to analyze and simulate complex DOD transportation scenarios for the Center for Army Analysis (CAA).  DOD transportation requirements are large-scale, multi-modal, time-constrained, with limited availability of lift assets, limited facility capabilities, difficult cargo matching constraints such as ammunition, strong dependence between coordinated movements, and numerous special handling needs.  To schedule and simulate a realistic transportation solution, GDAS must evaluate complex tradeoffs in port selection, air/sea/rail/truck mode selection, cargo configuration such as containerization, assignment of individual vehicle manifests, vehicle routing with refueling, scheduling of vehicles on multiple trips, and scheduling of facility throughput capabilities.  Each one of these decisions involves advanced research-level heuristic optimization algorithms which GDAS has integrated into its overall solution approach to analyze large-scale DOD transportation. Noetics developed and has provided direct support to CAA for GDAS for the last fifteen years under CAA guidance to explicitly model specialized but essential factors in DOD transportation.  This evolution has made GDAS a unique and valuable analytic tool for CAA studies, but has increased the complexity of all its major software components. GDAS components include a database system, scheduling and simulation model, reporting and query tools, interactive map display capabilities, and data import/export interfaces to external systems, along with many hundreds of pages of documentation.  Noetics generates some of the code by a unique process called auto-coding using code generator tools that are not part of the GDAS system itself.  Noetics, Inc. has been the developer working with CAA to implement the GDAS software package from its inception. Noetics is directly familiar with all aspects of the database, model code, interfaces to external systems, and the scenario data itself, and Noetics has provided ongoing training for CAA personnel and immediate onsite assistance for CAA analytic requirements. Because of the limited budget of the proposed task order, the complexity and extended scope of the existing GDAS software, the short delivery time needed for implementing specific new features, and the requirement for immediate expertise in the GDAS algorithms and code, GovWorks intends to award a sole source task order to Noetics for continued maintenance and extension of the GDAS software. The use of Noetics in a sole source contract is a logical follow on and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL  LICENSEE(S) TO COMMERCIALIZE AN ELECTRICAL RECEPTACLE
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL 
LICENSEE(S) TO COMMERCIALIZE AN ELECTRICAL RECEPTACLE

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial licensee(s) to commercialize LLNL's Electrical Receptacle technology.  

The Electrical Receptacle is designed for a three-prong electrical plug 
(NEMA 5-15) with either a tubular or U-shaped grounding prong. Although the two types of prongs do fit into existing receptacles on the market and in use, because of the differences in the dimensions of the prongs, most if not all existing grounding-receptacle designs fail to assure ground integrity. LLNL’s receptacle design is spacious enough to prevent the socket from significantly stretching when the larger, U-shaped (0.184” width x 0.200” height) grounding prong is inserted into the socket.  Moreover, the two-ridge track design allows a close fit when the smaller tubular (0.184” diameter) grounding prong is inserted into the socket. Many existing sockets on the market stretch or bend for the larger U-shaped prong, causing improper contact between the stretched socket and the smaller tubular prong, compromising integrity of the ground. LLNL’s Electrical Receptacle addresses the aforementioned problem by controlling the travel of the legs of the U-shaped grounding prong to help prevent enlargement of the receptacle insert space.  This new design may be easily incorporated into existing products:  wall outlets, extension cords, surge protectors, and other NEMA 5-15 receptacles. 

This electrical receptacle is the subject of U.S. Patent 5,221,211. Additional technical information can also be obtained on LLNL’s Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization Website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/e-receptacle/index.php.

LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market.  Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or nonexclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Electrical Receptacle should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA 94551-0808
Attention: FBO 87-04

Please provide your response within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Electrical Receptacle.

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build a blue (493nm +/- 3nm) Ytterbium solid state laser.

Researchers at LLNL have developed an efficient, compact means of building a laser that emits blue laser light at a wavelength of 493 +/- 3 nm.  This laser uses a laser diode-pumped ytterbium-doped laser crystal emitting on its zero phonon line (ZPL) resonance transition at a wavelength of 986 +/- 6 nm. A polarizer in the resonant cavity is used to force the laser gain medium to generate laser light on the zero-phonon-line (ZPL) transition. The output laser light is then frequency doubled into the blue spectral region through the use of a nonlinear harmonic doubler crystal.

The preferred host crystals have strong ZPL fluorecence (laser) transitions lying in the spectral range from 980 to 992 nm.  The laser can use many different types of ytterbium-doped crystals, but Yb:S-FAP is preferred gain medium of the blue laser device, since a polarizer is readily used to suppress the 1.05 micron oscillation and because 493 nm operation has a very low threshold.  U.S. Patent #6,304,584 sets forth the different types of crystals that are suitable for use in this laser, as well as describing the other features of the laser’s design.

This laser is useful for many applications in the field of medicine and biology.  For example, this laser radiation will excite biofluorescent dyes (in the 490-496 nm spectral region) utilized in flow cytometry, immunoassay, DNA sequencing, and other biofluorescence instruments. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's blue Ytterbium solid state laser should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.






Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 89-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's blue ytterbium solid state laser.
