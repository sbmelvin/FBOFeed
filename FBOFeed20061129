<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  A LEAD ENGINEER DESIGNER IS REQUIRED. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  

A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area in which the project is located.  The A/E firm will address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II. 

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and Design Firm. In Stage II, shortlisted Lead Designer-A/E Teams will be interviewed.


Stage I 
All documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format. The assembled content for the Stage I portfolio should be no more than 1/4 inch thick. The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions. 

Identification of team members, other than the Lead Designer(s),is not required at this stage. Team member information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio.

Submission Requirements And Evaluation Criteria: 
(1)	PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%): The A/E Firm(s) will submit a portfolio of not more than five similarly scoped projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). The narrative shall: address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution; address the relevance of submitted projects to this project; and provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, email, phone, and fax numbers. A representative plan and other relevant graphics should be included for each project. 
(2)	PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state the parameters he/she will apply to the challenges of: designing limited scope projects for major public facilities; meeting federal standards and codes; addressing sustainable design goals of construction waste management, energy efficiency, and environmental responsibility; managing work in occupied buildings; and integrating new design into existing systems and infrastructure. 
(3)	LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of the portfolio examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.
(4)	LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence. Address his or her participation in each project. If a single designer, submit an illustrated portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). If the Lead Designer is a team, submit graphics and a description of up to two projects from each Lead Designer or Lead Design discipline. The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operations and maintenance objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. Include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence. Where there is duplication with criteria (1) Past Performance on Design, the Lead Designer shall address his or her participation in the project. 

 
Stage II
The short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. Sufficient time will be provided for the Lead Designer-A/E Design Firm to establish its team. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I shortlist announcement. GSA plans to announce the shortlisted firms the week of April 24, 2006.  All firms who have been identified on the shortlist will be interviewed either May 10th or 11th, 2006.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for technical reports on the spaceflight heritage, technical specifications, and in flight performance on a nonmagnetic, autonomous, attitude determination device or star camera in a high radiation environment, co-located with the magnetometer at the end of a spacecraft boom. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the above mentioned proprietary reports from the Measurement and Instrumentation Systems section at Oersted- Technical University of Denmark (DTU) on a sole-source basis. The authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.    DTU is the only organization that has a space-qualified, attitude determination device, or star camera, co-located at the magnetometer that is nonmagnetic and therefore does not interfere with the magnetometer sensors when co-located at the magnetometer. In addition to, the magnetic cleanliness, and the small size (~300 cm cubed)and light weight (~0.4kg) of the DTU Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC) camera head unit make it ideal for use in conjunction with magnetometer instruments at the end of a boom. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on the date specified above.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for conference support for a roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine.  The Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine will provide a  convening mechanism for interested parties from the academic, industrial, consumer, and federal research perspectives to meet and discuss sensitive and difficult issues of mutual interest in a neutral setting. The purpose is to exchange scientific information  and discussion across sectors and institutions, and to illuminate issues, not resolve them. Specific agenda topics will be determined by the Roundtable membership, but will focus on areas such as: enhancing environmental health in health care; clinical and environmental health research strategies; susceptible populations; and workforce and health professional education.  The Roundtable will not provide advice or recommendations on any specific issue or policy pending before any government agency; summary reports will result from the conferences, but will not contain recommendations. The U.S. EPA intends on soliciting the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institute of Medicine (IOM) 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 as the sole candidate  pursuant to FAR 6.302-1"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The NAS IOM has been the lead in planning for the roundtable of discussions since 2000.  NAS IOM has the unique ability to convene committees of experts from academia, industrial, consumer, and federal perspectives to meet and discuss sensitive and difficult issues of mutual interest in a neutral setting.   NAICS Code 541611 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

The objective of the ADVANCE IQC is to provide a vehicle to support the ASEAN Secretariat and work with and through ASEAN member states? governments, civil society and the private sector to achieve results consistent with the goals outlined in the Joint Vision Statement. Assistance priorities will depend on the amount and type of funding available, USG legal and policy objectives and priorities of USAID. In particular, USAID expects to provide technical assistance, support and services to:

1.	Strengthen the Secretariat consistent with the Vientiane Action Program (VAP) by increasing its capacity to fulfill its mandate to initiate, advise, coordinate, and implement effective ASEAN activities including support of member states in their strategic development initiatives.

2.	Implement regional activities that enhance ASEAN integration and cooperation consistent with other specific VAP directives, including, but not limited to: economic integration, economic governance, commercial legal reform, intellectual property rights (IPR), trade capacity building (TCB), trade facilitation, customs reform, trade negotiations, SME development, cluster based competitiveness, supply chain development,  macroeconomic and policy reform, investment, financial sector surveillance and reform, capital market development, rule of law and legal reform, anti-corruption initiatives, human rights, immigration policy, trafficking in persons (TIP), regional security, counter-terrorism, cross-border environmental issues, energy efficiency and policy, regional health policy, regional emergency preparedness.

3.	Leverage the funding and expertise of development partners such as corporations, foundations, ASEAN member countries, other donors and NGOs to address jointly defined development challenges which are consistent with the objectives outlined in the JVS. 

USAID anticipates that ASEAN members in the region will require assistance from ADVANCE and that demand for services provided under the ADVANCE IQC will increase over time. The estimated ceiling of the IQC will be $150 million for a period of 5 years. 
Anticipated contractor duties include provision of technical and advisory services, training, research, and other services to: USAID missions, bureaus, and their clients. The contractor shall provide these services through execution of task orders with specified performance goals and bench-marks for achievement of objectives.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Kathryn Riley, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-2790
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Estuarine Research Federation in support of the 2007 Estuarine Research Federation Conference.  The Statement of Work and rationale for sole source purchase order follows. Statement of Work Project Description:	The 19th biennial conference of the Estuarine Research Federation will be held on November 4-8, 2007 in Providence, Rhode Island.  The primary objective of this conference, entitled Science and Management:  Observations/Syntheses/Solutions, is to provide opportunities for the exchange of information among research scientists and managers working in interdisciplinary and/or interagency settings and who need to be informed about the latest estuarine and coastal research and management issues. The  secondary objective is to further the mission of the Federation:  The Federation advances understanding and wise stewardship of estuarine and coastal ecosystems worldwide.  Its mission is to: "	Promote research in estuarine and coastal ecosystems "	Support education of scientists, decision-makers  and the public "	Facilitate communication among these groups In early 2007, we expect to receive about 1,500 abstracts covering all aspects of estuarine and coastal research and management.  These presentations are balanced between oral and poster presentations.  Different presentation formats  have included symposia, workshops, invited and contributed oral and poster sessions, panel discussions, colloquia and a plenaries.  Also, many types of structured and unstructured special events and receptions allow the attendees to communicate extremely effectively.   Over 1,700 attendees are  expected at this conference.  The distribution of attendees' affiliations is approximately 25% from federal agencies, 10-15% from state and local resource management agencies, 50-55 % scientists from academic or research institutions and approximately 20-25% students from various departments of  estuarine and coastal sciences. Task Requirements:  	EPA will gain visibility while promoting awareness of OWOW's mission in the estuarine and coastal environments through the following venues: Task 1.  Convening and participating in oral and poster sessions.  EPA scientists and managers will  convene several sessions at this conference.  As in the past, we also expect strong EPA participation as presenters in the oral and poster sessions.  A draft of the ERF 2007 session topics list is attached. 	Task 2. Publicity. EPA OWOW will be publicized in ERF's newsletters, press releases,  printed conference program and abstract book, on ERF's web site:  www.erf.org, plus on posters and banners set up on-site in the main conference gathering areas. 	Task 3. Ad space.  EPA OWOW will receive space for a full-page advertisement in the conference program and in an ERF newsletter. Task  4.  Complementary registrations. EPA will be offered 4 complimentary registrations to the ERF 2007 conference. 	Task 5. Display space. A 10-ft by-10 ft area and a skirted table will be provided for EPA OWOW to display an exhibit. 	Task 6. Opportunity to interact with students.  EPA will be  invited to the Student Career Social where EPA will be recognized.  At this event you will have the opportunity to speak with the students about careers at EPA. Justification of Sole Source to the Estuarine Research Federation Item 1.  Unique Experience:  The biennial conferences of the Estuarine  Research Federation (ERF) are the leaders in international meetings for the exchange of information among people who work in interdisciplinary and interagency settings and who need to be informed about the latest estuarine research and coastal management issues. The mission of EPA's Coastal  Management Branch (CMB) is to protect and maintain coastal watersheds by building partnerships, strengthening the capacity of our partners, sharing experience broadly and providing leadership and assistance to support community-based watershed management.  To accomplish this, CMB requires expertise  on coastal issues.  Also, it is necessary to provide a forum to share this information with coastal resource managers and other interested entities so that it can be used in the protection and restoration of our nation's coastal watersheds. As the premier professional membership organization  focused on estuarine and coastal research, ERF has preeminent status among professionals in those fields.  EPA requires the services of the Federation because it can pull together the collective expertise of its members including academic, federal, state and private sector leaders in estuarine and  coastal issues that influence the sciences management and policy worlds.  ERF has also organized one of the longest running series of estuarine and coastal conferences, beginning with the first conference in 1971. Item II.  Leveraging of Resources:  EPA's participation in the ERF 2007 conference  will leverage many more resources and reach many more people than EPA alone could do.  For instance, the conference will also be supported by other federal agencies, academic institutions nationwide and local private organizations.  Supporting federal agencies include NOAA and USGS.  Regionally,  EPA-Atlantic Ecology Division, University of New Hampshire, University of Maine, University of Rhode Island, Marine Biological Lab, Mass., Battelle Ocean Sciences and many others are providing conference organizing committee chairs and in-kind sponsorships.  Locally, private businesses are donating  in-kind services.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00043.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated for this full and open requirement.  The NAICS code is 541620, size standard $6.5 million.   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT  SERVICES Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human welfare (the environment).  As part of the NAAQS review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known  as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The schedule for the current review of the  NAAQS for NOx and SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for  NOx and SOx.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized  in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer-review draft that will be  vetted at a peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and integration of the available scientific knowledge  base, pertaining to oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described  in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor is interested in this  requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Ellen Bailey  at bailey.ellen@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) has conducted radionuclide decontamination experiments to evaluate the performance of aqueous polymeric coatings developed by Sandia as compared to a number of off-the-shelf (OTS), commercially available polymeric coatings. In addition to radionuclide decontamination, the coatings were evaluated for their strippability properties, drying time, water resistance and compatibility with additives developed and used by researchers at Sandia for enhanced radionuclide capture.  These coatings were tested on common building materials such as steel, glass, concrete, marble and granite.  Results of the experiments have been favorable with respect to both decontamination properties and strippability properties.  Patent pending.  

Sandia?s primary focus is in seeking a company or companies interested in partnering opportunities leading to licensing and commercial manufacturing of this technology.  Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/ or commercial licenses.  Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to Sandia.

For further information, interested parties should contact Teresa Garcia at Sandia National Laboratories by fax at 505-844-8011 or by email at tagarc1@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of this Federal Business Opportunity announcement.

<DESC>Upon recommendation of the General Services Administration (GSA) Regional A/E Evaluation Board, the following firms, in no particular order, have been invited to participate in Stage Two of the A/E selection process for this project:

MERRICK & Company, Aurora, CO
CH2MHILL, Englewood, CO
S.A. Miro, Inc., Denver, CO




The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	, sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

<DESC>On June 9, 2006, GSA selected CH2MHill for the Utility Infrastructure Renovation at the Denver Federal Center.

The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings)Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.

<DESC>This is an amendment to a previous sources sought market research announcement, only for extending the period for submitting responses. Interested vendors should contact the contracting officer, via email (steve.bense@va.gov), as part of this market research.  No collect calls. The VA National Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program is intending to replace its current mail manifesting support award.  The basic operation of the current award is synopsized as follows:  - Contractor retrieves parcels to be manifested from CMOP facilities.  - Contractor processes parcels by adding postage and sorting.  - Contractor inducts parcels to postal system for delivery.  - Contractor retains responsibility for package delivery to destination. In general, the prescribed products being delivered direct to the patient consist of approximately 35 million parcels being shipped direct to veteran patients who are located in any part of the United States or its territories, and will vary in parcel size and weight.  In general, delivery is expected to occur within a reasonable amount of time, normally considered to be 3-5 days. This is a sources sought announcement.  This is not an announcement of a solicitation, nor is it a request for proposals or quotations.  Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website for any further information related to this topic.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Health, Safety and Security (HSS), is seeking qualified small business sources that can provide all personnel, materials, and technical expertise in functional areas such as security, cyber security, integrated safeguards and security management, material control and accountability, and a variety of management, operational, and technical systems analyses in support of the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS) Program. The mission of the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS) Program is the national nuclear materials database and information system for tracking and accounting for nuclear materials controlled or licensed by the U.S. Government.  The NMMSS is the U.S. Government's official system for tracking and reporting of strategic nuclear materials subject to special control and accountability requirements and is therefore inherently a government function shared by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) who operate within the confines of DOE/NRC orders and regulations. The contractor shall provide professional, technical, and administrative support for the core operations of the NMMSS in the areas of database management, hardware and software maintenance, computer and communications security including but not limited to other relevant functional areas, including quality assurance, and comprehensive training programs.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide the best available technological, business, and management practices and policies to make improvements, as needed.  The contractor must be able to achieve a measurable demonstration of its performance in all aspects of NMMSS activities at all times. This effort is currently performed in the Atlanta, Georgia area and administered by the DOE Savannah River Operations Office.  However, the Department is exploring the option of solely performing this effort at the DOE Headquarters, Germantown Building or possible other DOE sites in the Washington, D.C. area.  For the purpose of submitting a capability statement in response to this â€œsources soughtâ€ study, interested parties should consider the Departmentâ€™s Germantown, Maryland complex as the performance site.  In addition, if an interested party has an alternative site that meets the requirements to perform the efforts in the attached Performance Work Statement and meets all DOE Security Requirements, a separate capability statement should be submitted at this time.  Please elaborate on cost saving benefits to the Government by use of your alternative site.  All alternative responses will be reviewed and considered. Interested business sources capability statements shall include answers to the questions below: 1. Provide a list of your firmsâ€™ previous contracts and experience for providing professional, technical, and administrative support for the core operations of a NMMSS type program in the areas of database management, hardware and software maintenance, computer and communications security including but not limited to other relevant functional areas, including quality assurance, and comprehensive training programs.  In addition, include the use of your best available technological, business, and management practices and policies to make improvements in current or past contracts of a similar nature.  Please provide a description of the work and a contact point with phone number for whom the work was performed. 2. Provide a list of any firms that your firm has teamed or partnered with on any Federal contract in the past five years. 3. Do you have existing staff and infrastructure to satisfactorily operate a contract with 15 to 25 personnel? If not, how would your firm specifically staff such a requirement? What subcontractor(s) does your firm have an arrangement that could assist in this type of effort? 4. Are you familiar with the tracking and reporting of strategic nuclear materials subject to special control and accountability requirements?  If so, could you please elaborate on the subject? 5. What is your corporate history and philosophy on retaining senior management and key personnel? 6. Please explain your corporate approach to recruiting and retention of non-key personnel? This announcement is part of market research and responses are sought to identify sources that have the comprehensive knowledge, skills, and capability to meet the overall requirement as described in the DRAFT Performance Work Statement  (PWS), DRAFT Position Descriptions (PDâ€™s), and Historical Staffing Plan contained herein. The majority of contractor personnel will be required to have a â€œQâ€ clearance at the time of contract award, or be capable of receiving a clearance within a reasonable time period after award. A current Department of Defense (DOD) Top Secret or other clearance based upon a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) is acceptable if the background investigation is less than 5 years old. The Government funding for this effort over the past several years has averaged $4-$5 million per year. Interested small business sources and small business-led teams and joint ventures are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than 20 pages to demonstrate their NMMSS capability to provide the requested services. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR A FORMAL PROPOSAL OR A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest and demonstration of capability to perform the anticipated work. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.

<DESC>The National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, in conjunction with the Center for Functional Nanomaterials, is developing a new undulator beamline X9 for the characterization of soft condensed matter materials and surfaces.  The proposed combined Small and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS/WAXS) capability of this new beamline requires a high resolution, vacuum-compatible area detector to be positioned inside a vacuum chamber close (~20cm) to the sample position and collect scattered x-rays from the sample at scattering angles up to 30 degrees and at the same time allow the x-rays at small scattering angles to reach the SAXS detector.

In addition to the manufacturer?s specification for a state-of-the-art SAXS/WAXS Detector system, the detector shall also be designed to meet BNL?s special requirements delineated in BSA specifications.

This, acquisition, is a, ?Best Value?, procurement.  The utilization of this procedure is expected to provide the greatest overall benefit to BSA/BNL.  ?Best Value? employs a trade off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the highest technically rated offeror.  The tradeoff process, associated with Best Value involves a comparative weighing of the evaluation factors and sub-factors identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP).   Specifically, the trade off process involves selecting the most advantageous offer based upon an integrated assessment of both non-cost/price factors, taken in their assigned relative importance.  

The following factors, in their relative order of weighting, will be utilized to evaluate the offers:

-  General Technical Specifications: Submit operating specifications for the proposed SAX/WAX detector system utilizing the same format (Section and Sub-Section numbering) presented by the specifications contained in the solicitation.

- System Support:  System support will be evaluated as to the level of warranty and support provided by the offeror and to what extent it conforms to the base requirements of the specification

-  Performance Risk: Submit references, points of contact and telephone numbers for manufacture of SAXS/WAXS Detector system or similar systems for the last 3 years.  

Proposals are due December 29, 2006, by 4:00 PM, EDT, and shall be submitted to Brookhaven Science Associates, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Attention: D. Paveglio, Bldg. 355, Upton, NY 11973.

These coatings were tested on common building materials such as steel, glass, concrete, marble and granite.  Results of the experiments have been favorable with respect to both decontamination properties and strippability properties.  Patent pending.  

Sandia?s primary focus is in seeking a company or companies interested in partnering opportunities leading to licensing and commercial manufacturing of this technology.  Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/ or commercial licenses.  Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to Sandia.

ESX Ranger, coupled with VMware’s VI3 , offers the department an online backup system with built in tracking.  The actual process of capturing a “snapshot” of an online virtual server is an isolated process that runs whether or not the machines is powered on.  Once the archive has been captured, the virtual image will be transferred to an alternate mirrored ESX server for quick failover and backups.  The process takes about 2 hours over a gigabit backbone.  This would occur during off hours as to minimally impact the customer base.    Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the classified and unclassified network.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. <BR><BR>

<DESC>This solicitation is for a Modified BRU-56 Study.  The B-1 program office is considering modifying the existing BRU-56 ejector rack to  provide additional munitions capability and flexibility, operational  reliability and effectiveness, and reduced total ownership cost.  A  modification and upgrade to the BRU-56 ejector rack on the Multi-Purpose  Rotary Launcher (MPRL) to launch either 14-inch or 30-inch lug spaced  weapons will contribute to increased safety, quicker sortie generation  rates, lower maintenance times, increased reliability and lower  maintenance personnel requirements.  This effort will study approaches to  use readily available pyrotechnic cartridges and provide for weapon pitch  control during ejection.

USCG HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET EXTERNAL AIRCRAFT PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


1.0	   BACKGROUND:

The USCG operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Until recently these aircraft have been externally stripped and painted at the USCG?s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM).  Aircraft painted at ARSC experience paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Poor paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the current paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the USCG intends to establish a long term commercial paint contract for its fleet of HU-25 aircraft whose anticipated retirement date is 2015.  This solicitation establishes the minimum external paint requirements.  


NOTES: A reduction in fleet size may occur by fiscal year 2008.  All aircraft will be stripped 
                by ARSC during PDM using corn starch blast media. 

                The USCG is also in the process of procuring one type of paint system for all aircraft.  
                The contractor must be able to adjust to the new system to be used.  


2.0	  OBJECTIVE:
            
      The USCG?s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center with an onsite paint facility. The contractor shall provide all services necessary to prepare and externally paint HU-25 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) best commercial practices, the paint manufacturer?s recommended procedures and the general scope work.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

THE COAST GUARD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO PERFORM A SITE SURVEY OF THE CONTRACTOR??S AND SUB-CONTRACTOR??S CAPABILITIES.


The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  


52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors ?V Commercial Items (Sept 2006)
 
52.212-2	Evaluation ?V Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

              The Coast Guard may determine the best value which merits a higher price based on  
                     technical superiority.  The Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the  
                     selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal??s relative capability as 
                     measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 ?V Technical/Management Approach
                       Factor 2 ?V Past Performance
                       Factor 3 ?V Cost/Price

	         Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While
               the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price 
               Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

               Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
               factors approach equal.

               Enclosure: (1) Detailed Factors
Enclosure (1)


DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical/Management Approach

The Technical/Management Approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Vendor??s solutions will achieve the USCG objectives of painting.  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Vendor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the Technical Approach includes:
 
(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical quote that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

            (c)  Complete all work in an enclosed hangar with a dedicated space to accommodate the
                   aircraft including separate protocols for temperature, humidity, ventilation, lighting and  
                   atmospheric particle controls for the paint to cure IAW the paint manufacturer??s 
                       instructions.

(d)	 A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify  
       and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The Management Approach 
       needs to provide:

?X	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing these services.

?X	Clear lines of communication between the Vendor??s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.

(e)	The Vendor??s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO  
      9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service  
      bulletins, and FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document..
.
Factor 2:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Vendor??s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The USCG reserves the right to investigate other sources of past performance other than those submitted by the contractor.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Vendor??s actual performance on painting of similar or like aircraft.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.  To include experience is applying High Solid VOC compliant paints to high speed aircraft.

Contractor??s customer ratings including quality ratings, customer service, warranty, recommendation for future service and performance of coating during the aircraft??s operational period (e.g. gloss, adhesion, and paint defects).
               
Factor 3:  Cost/Price

Each Vendor??s cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation or proposed cost/price.  Vendor??s quote shall be a firm-fixed-price.  USCG cost evaluation will be based on the combination of the following two criteria: 1) Vendor??s quote; 2) USCG travel cost and roundtrip aircraft ferry cost from Elizabeth city, NC.  There is no intent to sacrifice quality for schedule.    

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN in the Offeror??s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Offeror??s technical proposal.  The price quote should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.

3052.209-70   Prohibition on Contracts With Corporate Expatriates (Jun 2006) 


(b)	Prohibitions. 

                       Section 835 of Public Law 107?V296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security      
                       from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an  
                       inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an 
                       entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if 
                       the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, 
                       or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from  
                       incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

                       (b) Definitions.  As used in this clause: 

                      Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the

                      that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ??more than 50 percent?? for 
                      ??at least 80 percent?? each place it appears. 
                      Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of  
                      section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?V296, would be, treated as a 
                      foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    
                      Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an 
                      inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?X 
    
                      (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the 
                      properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the 
                      properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    
                      (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
                      is held?X 
    
(i)	In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former  
  shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic   
  corporation; or
    
                      (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former 
                      partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in

                      (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when  
                      determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted  
                      domestic corporation. 
    
                      (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as 
                      an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining  
                      ownership: 
     
                      (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
                      incorporated entity; or

                      indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership  
                      during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this  
                      Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, 
                      Such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    
                      (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by 
                       contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a 
                       principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    
                      (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of   
                      Public Law 107?V296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in 
                      regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the  
                      meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a  
                      partnership. 
    
                      (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 
                      (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present 
                      value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
 
                      (i) Warrants; 
                      (ii) Options; 
                      (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
                      (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
                      (v) Others similar interests. 
    
                      (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed  
                      appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard  
                      transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    
          (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor volun tarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5)  and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hour s.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial v ehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for deli very, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing gre ater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that the ir vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors  at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Fo rce Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contracto r vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate,  and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate o r the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at a ny tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gat e (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fa st Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check ( CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adv erse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification b adge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does n ot meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reaso n (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required ti me frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not  have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is disc overed, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identificatio n badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerc e definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.

Can you please let me know if there have been any changes or Q&As  regarding the solicitation? A. I plan to post all the Q&A I have so far on PIXS/FedBuzOpps, by COB  today (22 Nov 06). Q.  Section G. – Does G002 Program Manager refer to the Government program  manager, or does G002 refer to the Contractor’s program manager?? If G002  refers to a Government employee, will that position be approximately  equivalent to a Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTRT”)  and, if so, will that individual be located in Sweden or at Wright  Patterson Air Force Base?? A. The G002 PM is the Government PM who is located at WP.  The COTRT will  be located in Sweden and that person is yet to be determined. Q  F 33 - Does item number 9 on the Standard Form 33 contain the correct  due date for receipt of proposals as 1 December 2006, or is the Original  Response Date on the Synopsis to the Solicitation and the Response Date on  the PIXS of November 30, 2006 the correct due date?? Which is the correct  due date?  If this is not cleared up, doesnt it leave the potential for  confusion for any of the bidders participating? A.  The correct date is 1 Dec 2006.  I have corrected the date on PIXS.  Thanks, for catching that. Q.   Amendments 01 and 02 - The amendments are listed at the FedBizOpps  but the link does not reveal the actual documents. Will the Air Force post  these two (2) amendments to the FedBizOpps? A.  The only changes in Amendments 01 & 02 were administrative wording in  the bottom text area. Q. Amendments 01 and 02 - Will the Air Force issue the actual amendments  using Standard Form 30 with attachments as applicable A.     No Q.  Questions and Answers - Will the Air Force post the questions from  offerors and the Government’s answer to those questions on the FedBizOpps  for all offerors to read pursuant to FAR 15.201(f) and the Comptroller  General Decision number B-246301, 92-1? A.  I plan to post all the Q&A I have so far in the test area of PIXS by  COB today, 22 Nov 06. Q.  SF 33/Section L - What does the sentence “Electronic copies are  acceptable” mean? Does the Air Force want to receive proposal by e-mail  only? Or, does the Air Force want the proposals on a CD? Does the Air  Force want the original proposal in hard copy with electronic copies on a  CD? A.  Electronic Copy is any electronic form be it CD, or email, as long as  it is provided to us by COB 1 Dec 06.  Hard copies are also acceptable. Q.  Section B CLIN 0001 - Is the Unit Price and Total Item Amount strictly  limited to the fully burdened price for the personnel labor to the  exclusion of any other type of cost? A.  Section B, CLIN 0001 is not limited to labor.  It should include  anything you need to complete this effort, be it labor, material, etc. but  excluding effort covered in CLIN 0002. Q. Section B - CLIN 0002 - What is the definition of "Mobilization and  Demobilization Support" including what actions are required to be  completed  by the contractor? A.  CLIN 0002 is what we have in the descriptive data.  It includes the  cost of getting personnel over to Sweden and back at the end of the  contract as well as the possibility of having to replace personnel and the  NSA training.  Q. Section E 004 - Is the DD Form 250 applicable to CLIN 002? A.  E004 does not apply to CLIN 0002. Q.  Section F.1 - What CLIN is applicable to FAR 52.247-29 and FAR  52.247-34 respectively? A.  I will be changing all of CLIN 0003 to FOB Destination.  Q. Section G002 - Is the Program Manager a Key Person? A. Yes.  Q. Section I - Since Section L046 (a) states that offerors are not  required to submit cost or pricing data, will the Air Force delete FAR  52.215-10 and FAR 52.215-12 since these clauses are not invoked? A.  I will remove FAR 52.215-10 and 52.215-12 from the contract when it is  awarded. Q. Section L.II.B.3.1 - What is the definition of a "separate form"  for the submission of technical and cost proposals? Are they separate  binders? Or, are the separate tabs within a binder? Or, are they separate  portions of an Air Force form? A.Separate forms simply means we need to be able to separate the cost  portion from the technical portion.  It can be separate binders if you  choose. Q.  Part of Para 4.15 states Sweden will provide private access to long  distance phone lines (note 1). Does this mean Sweden will be paying for  all long distance telephone calls or will the fees be charged to the task.  How about telephones? A.  The Swedish government (i.e. Forsvarets Materielverk - FMV) will  provide telephones in the U.S. COMSEC Vault for the U.S. custodians to  conduct official business, as well as access to long distance phone lines  for official business purposes. It is anticipated that the U.S. custodians  will use e-mail for most communications to U.S. or European agencies; and  therefore, the need to conduct long distance phone calls should be  minimal. HQ USEUCOM / J-9 will be providing Secure Telephone Equipment  (STE) devices for the U.S. COMSEC Vault, so the U.S. Custodians may  conduct secure voice communications with NSA offices or HQ USEUCOM / J-9,  as may be required. Q.. Should computers, printers, pc supplies, internet connection and ISP  provider and office consumables be part of the Firm Fixed Price bid? A.  Desk top computers, printers, computer supplies, NSA/GSA approved  shredder, internet connection, ISP provider service, and normal office  consumable items (paper, pencils, etc) will be provided buy the Swedish  government (i.e. FMV), as may be required. Q. We don’t see where it states Sweden will provide a proper (note 2) CMS  vault. A CMS vault is where all of the CMS material is stored. It must be  large enough to allow our two custodians to work in it on a regular basis.  Will Sweden be providing the CMS vault or is it to be part of the Firm  Fixed Price bid? A. The U.S. COMSEC Vault facility is located within the FMV complex (in  Stockholm) and has been inspected by the USAFE Information Assurance  Branch and approved / certified for classified operations and storage of  classified COMSEC material up to “Secret Releasable to Sweden.” The  facility meets the standards outlined in NAG-14, Safeguarding COMSEC  Material and Facilities; EKMS 1, EKMS Policy and Procedures; EKMS 3A,  Inspection Guide Manual, and Annex E, Inspection Guide for Fixed COMSEC  Facilities. (Re HQ USAFE / A6NI letter dated 28 July 2006). The vault has  a large office working area, a new outer door and combination lock meeting  NSA/GSA required standards, and an inner vault for storage of CCIs and  COMSEC key-mat material. The vault is completely ready for activation. Q. We are under the impression that the packing/shipping/unpacking of  employee household goods and the shipping of their POVs would be charged  to item 0002 Noun: MOBILIGATION AND DEMOBILIZATIONOF SUPPORT.  Will their  cola and housing allowance also be charged to this item? A. The vendor will pay for all costs associated with the packing /  shipping / unpacking of employee household goods, as well as the shipment  of any employee POVs.  Cost of Living Allowance and housing allowance will  be negotiated between the vendor and its employees (i.e. the Custodian  personnel).  The costs for vehicles used for official business by the U.S  COMSEC Custodians will not be provided by FMV.  The vendors will need to  include the vehicle cost in their Proposals. They should consider the cost  of a small vehicle, gas consumption on a monthly basis, and vehicle  maintenance.   We do not anticipate that the US COMSEC Custodians will  need to be doing a lot of driving on a monthly basis in the performance of  their official duties. In addition, the custodians could always take a  train from Stockholm, if they need to travel to a distant location within  Sweden. Q.  Would you be able to provide the city whereas the work is going to be  performed? A  The work will be performed in the city of Stockholm.  The COMSEC vault  is located at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) facility  complex. Q.  Do you have any documentation, such as MOA/LOI that states this work  is in compliance with US export and import regulation?  If so, could you  please provide a copy? A.  No.  We are not exporting or importing materials.  We are contracting  services. The work is to be accomplished in compliance with the EUCOM/NATO  requirements. Q.  Section M. II.2.0(a)  -  Sub-section L.II.B.3.7(h) requires offerors to furnish past performance information with their technical proposals.  Will the Air Force revise the evaluation criteria in Section M.II.2.0 to include Past Performance as Sub-factor 2 so that only offerors with actual COMSEC experience are deemed technically acceptable A.  No – The past performance requested in Sec L.II.B.3.7(h)  is for the  technical evaluator’s information.  It will not be a determining factor in  the final decision. Q.  Section M. II.2.0(e) - The RFP states that an "offeror's price will be evaluated to ensure that proposed costs are reasonable and realistic" will the Air Force actually perform a price analysis on CLIN  001, pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(b) on CLIN 0001, and a cost realism analysis, pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(d) on CLIN 002? A.  Yes Q.  Section B CLIN 0002 - Does this cost element include the cost of housing (including miscellaneous household living items) for the personnel in Sweden, car rental, shipping, local transportation as well as travel expenses for the personnel? A.  It includes travel over and back as well as approved change in  personnel and NSA training.  All other costs are to be in CLIN 0001 Q. Regarding the SOW.   Does a US COMSEC account already exist or will it  need to be established? Will the primary and/or alternate COMSE Managers  participate in establishing a new COMSEC account?  If so, what will this  entail and if not, who will carry out all of the "one time" tasks/duties  required to establish a new US COMSEC account? A.  The US COMSEC Account has not been established because the COMSEC  Custodians have not been named yet.  The vault issue has been addressed in  question # 3 and has been approved by NSA.  Once the COMSEC Custodians are  named, NSA will establish a COMSEC account number.  After the COMSEC  Custodians arrive into Sweden, they will receive the COMSEC Custodian  training at Stockholm that will be provided to them from NSA Europe  (NCEUR).  (The travel funding for this training will be provided by USAF  ESC/KLI.) Amendment 0001 is available extending the receipt date from 1 Dec 06 to 8  Dec 08.  A copy will be emailed to all who have previously requested the  RFP.  If you do not receive a copy please contact Charlotte Puthoff at  charlotte.puthoff@wpafb.af.mil For more information on "Sweden COMSEC", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5070
