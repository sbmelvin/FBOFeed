<DESC><p>The NATO Communication and Information Systems Services Agency (NCSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of Provision of Support to the Centralized NATO Automated Financial System (CNAFS).</p>
<p>The services shall be delivered in locations throughout Europe and the United States with NCSA HQ SHAPE in Mons, Belgium as the primary place of work.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce will nominate to the bidders list only those firms in possession of a current SECRET Facility Security Clearance. In addition, all contractor personnel involved in the project must be in possession of current SECRET Personnel Security Clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>

<p>The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is IFIB-11-07-NCSA-NCHQ and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference.</p>
<p>The base contract is for a period of 6 months in 2011 with up to four one-year support options.</p>

The requirement is to procure services by technical and functional consultants supporting the system and providing training.</p>

<p>Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES</p>
<p>1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 13 April 2011</p>
<p>(Under MBC rules, the contracting agency will continue to accept nominations to the bidders list after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.)</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL
<p>PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN TRANSPORTATION DECISIONMAKING <br />TPE12-30</p>
<p>Agency:  The National Transit Institute</p>
<p>Date for receipt of proposals:  Friday, April 29, 2011</p>
<p>The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals from qualified professionals to facilitate its existing Public Involvement in Transportation Decisionmaking course.  In addition, NTI may periodically request proposers to edit/update the existing course materials.</p>
<p>NTI's Public Involvement in Transportation Decisionmaking is a three-day course.  Public Involvement is much more than posting notices and holding public hearings.  Public participation involves creative thinking, with willingness and ability to interact openly to the public's preferred forms of communication.  It is about being sensitive to disparate needs, conflicting priorities, and building partnerships with communities in order to have successful public involvement.  It is about giving the public an opportunity to influence transportation decisionmaking from all aspects of a project.  This course "walks the talk" by employing public involvement techniques as the means of conveying the key learning outcomes.  The course reviews and discusses various time tested and new techniques for involvement.  It is a joint effort among FTA's Office of Planning, NTI, the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Office of Planning, and the National Highway Institute (NHI) and was recently updated to reflect changes in the Federal Transportation reauthorization.</p>
<p>This course seeks to give transit agencies, planners, transportation specialists, communication professionals and others the practical strategies, examples, and tools they need to address new and existing Public Involvement efforts in their regions and communities, and engage in better decisionmaking in transportation.</p>
<p>A copy of the complete Request for Proposal #1583 can be obtained through at http://procure.rutgers.edu under the category "Active Bids".</p>
<p>The login:   RFP1583<br /> Password: s5cmYAfC     (case and space sensitive).</p>
<p>Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to providing opportunities to small business, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned businesses. These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.</p>

The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand the contractor base by awarding additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts.  Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones.

  No Time-and-Material (T&M) task orders are allowed.
-All requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices.
-Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders
-Seaport-e program goal is to award 33% of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors.
-Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20% of the dollars obligated.
-Only one ID/IQ contract award is allowed for individual companies as a Prime; however a contractor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes.
-Task Orders are competed in one of seven geographic zones (Northeast, National Capital, Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest) based on the place of performance for the solicited requirements.
-Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principal place of performance.
-The basic ID/IQ contracts limits pass-through charges, caps maximum fees, annual escalation, and requires cost savings.

The anticipated ordering period includes a thirty-six (36) month Base Period and two-twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7M.

The plan shall address step by step, the checks and balances in place to detect and report potential or actual COI at the organizational and personal level as set forth in the MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTORS' CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLANS.<br /><br />The minimum standards set forth the criteria which offerors' COI plans must meet in order to be acceptable to the Agency.<br /><br />The COI plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer and incorporated into any resulting contract. The plan shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in the EVALUATION OF<br />CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN.<br /><br />MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTORS' CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLANS<br /><br />1. PURPOSE<br /><br />The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified a need to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual and potential contractor conflicts of interest (COI). To accomplish this, contractors are required to have a COI plan for identifying and reporting actual and potential COI. The purpose of this document is to set forth the minimum standards for a contractor's COI plan. The CO may require the contractor to provide additional information if necessary.<br /><br />2. COI PLAN<br /><br />The contractor's COI Plan is a document which describes the procedures a company uses to identify and report COI. Generally, a contractor's corporate COI plan will describe how a company, in its entirety, addresses conflicts, and will not be contract or program specific. The plan may also describe the options a company will consider proposing to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate a COI whenever a conflict is identified. The plan will be evaluated by the applicable EPA Contracting Officer (CO), and approved by the CO if the Plan meets the EPA's minimum requirements for detecting and reporting conflicts of interest. The CO may accept the same version of a COI plan previously approved by another CO when appropriate. Contractors' COI Plans should be identified by a version number and date, as appropriate. EPA should be advised of the version number, date, and applicable CO for any previously approved COI plan.<br /><br />3. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CONTRACTORS' COI PLANS<br /><br />A. Corporate Structure<br /><br />The COI Plan shall describe any parent relationship and list all affiliates, subsidiaries, and sister companies, etc. Generally, this need not exceed three corporate tiers, unless a relationship exists beyond three tiers that would potentially create a conflict. In such a case, relationships beyond three tiers should also be included in the COI Plan. Contractors shall report changes in its corporate structure to the Agency throughout contract performance.<br />Contractors are invited to include under this section a company profile. The profile should discuss all pertinent information relevant to COI including a summary of a contractor's primary and/or environmental business functions, relationships, and activities. This background information will be very useful to COs when evaluating whether or not a contractor has a COI.<br /><br />B. Searching and Identifying COI<br /><br />The COI Plan shall include a requirement describing when a COI search must be performed by company personnel and clearly identify the procedures to be followed. The searching requirement shall encompass all work related to all clients for whom work was performed over the past three years, all current work, all sites (if applicable), and any future work reflected in marketing proposals. Contractors must search their records over the past 36 months, or through all available records for a new company until 36 months of records are accumulated, from the time of receipt of the work from EPA. However, contractors are encouraged to search back as far as a company's records cover.<br /><br />C. Data Base<br /><br />The COI Plan shall require a data base that includes all necessary information for a contractor to review its past work (at a minimum over the past 36 months or through all available records for a new company until 36 months of records are accumulated), work in progress, and work the company may be pursuing under any marketing proposals. This requirement does not establish any particular type or kind of retrieval system, however, the data base shall contain, at a minimum, the following information and capabilities.<br />(1) a list of the company's past and current (public and private) clients; contractor has worked on;<br />(2) a description of the type(s) of work that was performed and any other pertinent information;<br />(3) a list of the past sites (when applicable) a contractor has worked;<br />(4) a list of site name(s) (when applicable) related to any work performed;<br />(5) the ability to search and retrieve the information performed; and<br />(6) dollar value of work performed;<br />(7) a list of work the company may be pursuing in the future.<br />If applicable, the COI Plan shall include provisions for supplemental searches of parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or sister company records. The COI Plan shall also describe any cross-checks used by the company when searching COI issues.<br /><br />D. Personal Certification<br /><br />At a minimum, the COI Plan shall require ALL employees of the company performing work under an EPA Superfund and/or Non-Superfund contract, including work on a site, work relating to a site, work pertaining to a CERCLA/RCRA action, or work that may endanger a CERCLA enforcement action, to sign a personal certification. EPA recommends a policy whereby all company employees are required to sign such a certification rather than only those employees working under an EPA contract. The certification shall require at a minimum that the individual agrees to report to the proper company authority any personal COI and that the individual has read and understands the company's COI Plan and procedures. Employee certifications shall be retained by the company.<br /><br />E. Work Assignment (WA), Technical Direction Document (TDD), or Delivery <br />Order (DO) Notification and Certification<br /><br />If the contract contains the requirement for WAs, TDDs, or DOs, the COI Plan shall describe the company's process for meeting the Agency's notification requirement prior to beginning work and for submission of the company's WA/TDD/DO certification within 20 days of receipt of the EPA work. <br />NOTE: WA/TDD/DO certifications are NOT required if the contract contains an annual certification requirement. Nevertheless, the contractor's COI Plan shall address the procedures to be followed for WA/TDD/DO certifications.<br /><br />F. Annual Certification <br /><br />The COI Plan shall describe the process the company uses for submission of its annual certification.<br /><br />NOTE: Annual certification is NOT required if the contract contains a WA/TDD/DO certification requirement. Nevertheless, the contractor's COI Plan shall address the procedures to be followed for annual certifications.<br /><br />G. Notification and Documentation<br /><br />The COI Plan shall clearly identify the official within the company responsible for making COI determinations. Generally, this would be someone at a middle to upper level of management. The responsible official shall be free of any personal conflicts for the purpose of making COI determinations, e.g., a program manager who receives bonuses based on the total amount of sales may not be free of conflicts.<br />The COI Plan shall clearly identify the process that is followed when notifying the EPA of any actual or potential COI and the actions that the company has taken or will take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the conflict. In addition, the contractor shall document all COI searches related to EPA work, whether or not an actual or potential COI has been identified.<br /><br />H. Training<br /><br />The COI Plan shall require all employees of the company to receive basic COI training and that each employee receive COI awareness training at least annually. The company's COI Plan shall be available for all employees to review. Annual awareness training shall include, at a minimum, a review of the certification language and any changes that may have occurred in the company's COI Plan or Government COI regulations. In addition, companies are encouraged to routinely disseminate to their employees current COI information.<br /><br />I. Subcontractor's COI Plans<br /><br />The COI Plan shall describe the process and mechanism by which the company will monitor its subcontractors to ensure all subcontractors are complying with the COI provisions in their contracts. It is important that subcontractors identify and report COI as well as submit Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) requests for approval.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN<br /><br />The plan described in the "CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN" will be evaluated as acceptable or not acceptable as part of the contracting officer's responsibility determination of the contractor. Notwithstanding any other evaluation of the offeror's proposal, an offeror that submits a plan that is unacceptable at the time of award will not be eligible for a contract award.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>F-15 Training Systems Sustainment Re-Compete</p>
<p>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this document, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />(c) Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements that provide support to F-15 Training Systems (F-15E Aircrew Training Devices and Maintenance Training Devices) and F-15 Training System Support Center (TSSC). Key areas are Contractor Logistic Support (CLS), availability, concurrency, modernization/obsolescence, sustainment and engineering services. The F-15 ATD/MTD (hereafter referred to as the F-15 Training Systems) primary missions are to train F-15 aircrew and maintenance personnel to safely perform their missions with the highest degree of accuracy and proficiency possible. The F-15 Training Systems users and customers are represented by Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education Training Command (AETC). This contract currently supports all fielded F-15 ATDs (all six at Seymour Johnson AFB) with on-site CLS and MTDs (26 across 6 USAF locations) with on-call CLS support.</p>
<p>(d) The total sustainment effort will entail:<br />- Provide personnel and processes for engineering (training device modifications and database updates), logistics, maintenance, and operations services to support the F-15 Training System.<br />- Provide on-site and on-call CLS, and contractor support relative to the maintenance and operation of the F-15 Training System in a classified and unclassified environment.<br />- Operation of a TSSC to perform all hardware and software modifications, including but not limited to, concurrency updates, to the F-15 <br />trainer product baselines and coordinate all logistics and maintenance functions. <br />- Operation of a Stock, Store, and Issue Center (SSIC) to maintain, stock, store, and distribute all F-15 Training System technical documents, engineering drawings, and software. <br />- Operation of a Depot Logistics Support function to provide for tracking, repair, and stocking of spare parts for all F-15 Training System maintenance functions. <br />- Develop and field new USAF-owned F-15 maintenance and aircrew training devices identified by the USAF and then support, maintain and upgrade those devices.</p>
<p>(e) The follow-on contract is expected to have a period of performance of no more than 5 years. The government anticipates award of a predominately Firm Fixed Price contract, possibly with incidental contract line items of other contract types as appropriate.</p>

The HUD enables helicopter pilots to use the Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations.  The HUD provides critical operational information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image.  The HUD minimizes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit.<br><br>  The government is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN/AVS-7(V) family of HUD assemblies and sub-assemblies.  The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a five-year period. Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system.   Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit and function as called out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days.  This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do not exist for this equipment.  A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.  The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.  <br><br>Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 11 April 2011, to CECOM LCMC PRD Directorate, ATTN: RDER-PRA-CA (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1202, Ft.

<DESC>This source sought notice is posted to provide the small business community an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities in response to a Virtual Data Center (VDC) need within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This notice is for small businesses only (e.g., 8(a), service disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business and women-owned small business). Large businesses should not respond. Teaming arrangements and joint ventures are encouraged for vendors preparing responses to this notice. The Government will assess each capability response in order to determine that the small business, as the potential prime contractor, can satisfy the FAR Limitation on Subcontracting where at least 50% of the labor dollars are incurred by the prime for each functional area defined in this notice.
<p>CMS plans to issue multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to meet the VDC needs. The primary objective of the VDC is to provide the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and services to operate CMS business systems and to safeguard its data. The VDC is considered mission critical. At this time, CMS anticipates a separate small business IDIQ set aside for VDC-related work. The functions of that effort will be defined at a later time.</p>
<p>Interested parties may use the chart as a guideline in preparing responses; at a minimum, each respondent must demonstrate the proposed prime contractor's capabilities and experiences for the defined functional areas. In addition, the same level of information shall be provided for each potential subcontractor/teaming partner.</p>
<p>FUNCTIONAL AREAS: See attachment entitled VDC IDIQ SS Functional Areas</p>
<p>CMS believes that the work performed in each functional area must be provided in a way that ensures a high level of interoperability and integration between CMS business systems and other government agency systems; this will allow for increased availability of critical systems, expansion of disaster recovery capabilities and compliance with CMS and other government security standards. Each respondent must meet the resource requirements provided below in addressing its capabilities as identified in the chart above; again, while teaming is encouraged, the response must show that the small business possesses control of these resources independently in the event of unsuccessful subcontractors/teaming arrangements. This will be critical to the success of the small business prime contractor.</p>
<p>RESOURCES:<br /><br />1)Own/lease and operate data centers to ensure highest prioritization of resources in support of CMS' business applications. Currently the Office of Information Services has contractors that run three data centers. Combined these data centers are currently comprised of the following:<br /><br />a) 10,000 square feet of raised floor space<br /><br />b) 600 UNIX servers running Solaris 10 with 350 virtualized local zones within 100 global zones<br /><br />c) 300 Windows Servers of which approximately 250 Servers are virtualized on an Egenera platform<br /><br />d) Three IBM z10 Mainframes currently processing up to 21,000 MIPS<br /><br />e) WAN Data Communications that operate Primary and Backup DS3 Network Connections at each data center<br /><br />f) A combined Tape Library consisting of over&nbsp;500,000 cartridges running on various tape drive devices<br /><br />g) A combined storage capacity with over 700 TB running on DASD and SAN devices<br /><br />h) Ability to process 200,000 scheduled and non scheduled batch jobs per month<br /><br />i) Provide Seat Management and Help Desk services and support for 5200 CMS employees within&nbsp;Central, Regional and Satellite offices</p>
<p>2)Substantial resources to expedite large quantity purchases and delivery of materials (e.g, resources to ensure that 100+ desktops can be purchased, imaged and installed in under 30 days as a result of an influx of hundreds of new employees).</p>
<p>3)Possess the resources necessary (at the appropriate knowledge level) to recover from a catastrophic Virtual Data Center (VDC) failure. For instance, the following real world, recent examples of these issues included (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>a) The power disruption in the Baltimore Data Center in 2006/2007 - It was necessary for a contractor to work directly with electrical technicians to coordinate the reconfiguration of power feeds with the stopping and starting of<br />numerous critical IT services and continuously communicated system availability to the user community.</p>
<p>b) The H1N1 Pandemic of 2009/2010 - A contractor was able to quickly provide all necessary resources and demonstrate the ability to ensure that mission critical data center operations could be maintained in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>c) The shutdown of the Baltimore Facility during the Blizzard of 2010 - A contractor was able to provide local lodging and transportation to<br />essential data center staff to ensure mission critical operations continued while the CMS facility was closed.</p>
<p>d) The corrupt MacAfee Anti-virus data file in 2010 - Within hours of the incident, a contractor was able to provide over 100 additional resources<br />from within the corporation to manually fix over 4,000 laptops and desktops over a 2 day period.</p>
<p>Please note that at the time that the Government requests proposals on this effort, the prime contractors must be Capability Maturity Model Infrastructure (CMMI) level 3 certified.</p>
<p>CMS will not review or answer questions from vendors at this time.</p>
<p>Please send this statement to OAGM_DSC@cms.hhs.gov no later than the response date of this Sources Sought notice. Responses should not exceed 25 pages.</p>

GSFC invites vendors to provide candid opinions on the proposedrequirement.NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE SIMULATIONSYSTEM (CLIMATE@HOMEPROJECT)   NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is looking to enter into a non-funded Space ActAgreement partnership for the development of a climate simulation system referred tohereafter as the Climate@Home project.  The Climate@Home project will build a virtualclimate simulation supercomputer with contributions from citizens for both their idlecomputing cycles and local knowledge about climate change.  The Climate@Home effort willbe a major step towards developing a new quantitative system for prioritizing anddesigning a climate simulation system.	It will spur a closer relationship between theclimate science hypothesis (a climate model) and the design of the simulation system usedto test that hypothesis.  Additionally, it will allow for prior assessment ofmeasurements against specific accuracy, coverage and biases we will be able to constrainwithin model parameterizations.   The Climate@Home project will also contribute to thenational and international effort to better understand climate change, prepare citizensfor climate change, and support regional to global climate related policy and decisionmaking. The Information Technology (IT) infrastructure supporting the Climate@Home projectshould be able to handle data intensive, computing intensive, spatiotemporal intensiveand concurrent intensive problems posed by climate studies. Within climate sciences,hundreds of models, millions of configurations, and billions of model runs are requiredfor scientists to better determine parameters and experiment thousands of algorithms andtheories. NASA/GSFC seeks a collaborator with cutting-edge solutions and advanced computingtechnologies, including, but not limited to, cloud computing, virtual storage,multidimensional visualization tools, grid computing and innovative business models toassist with the research of applications and facilitation of the current Climate@Home ITarchitecture.

Work will potentially occur throughout the Pacific West Region and Intermountain Region. The two regions encompass the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Montana, Wyoming Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. This area contains nearly 150 sites that serve approximately 100 million visitors annually.  The parks of these regions contain thousands of historic structures and archeological sites, hundreds of miles of historic trails, bike paths, riverfront, numerous statues, memorials, historic forts, and battlefields. Despite ongoing repair and maintenance, the road systems in these regions continue to deteriorate. 
In some cases, recommendations for road and trail treatments may have been developed.  Work may include validating those recommendations and submitting alternate design recommendations when characteristics of materials, project conditions, weather, test results or other circumstances warrant adjustments. 
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  NPS is exploring the possibility of soliciting and awarding several multiple year construction IDIQ contract(s) to satisfy this need and is trying to determine the contractor interest, availability, and expertise for this type of requirement.  Other agencies within the Department of Interior, the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Forest Service may be authorized to order from these contracts.  This IDIQ contract will consist of (1) one base year and (4) four one-year option periods.  The guaranteed minimum amount for each contract awarded will be $25,000.00.  The estimated maximum amount will be refined with market research.  It is currently anticipated that the ceiling of each IDIQ contract is anticipated to be $40-50 million for the life of the contract which includes the base and option years combined.  Individual projects are anticipated to be valued at approximately $5,000 to15 million, but may be outside of this range.  Contract values are subject to change based upon the responses received to this announcement and further market research. Payment and performance bonds will be required for each project.
The NPS is considering separating the work based upon the below geographic areas.

Remedial Action Construction (RAC) is the phase of the CERCLA process where the site remedy is constructed either as an interim or final action. This phase may include the construction of various soil, sediment and/or groundwater remediation systems that function as containment (e.g. soil cover, RCRA cap, slurry wall, pump & treat systems); in-situ treatment (e.g.natural attenuation, soil vapor extraction, enhanced bio-remediation, air sparging) or ex-site treatment (air stripping, constructed wetlands, off site disposal, stabilization, solidification).
Remedial Action Operations (RAO) is the phase of the CERCLA process when the remediation system (possibly constructed under the RAC phase noted above) is in place and is operating, or the chemical or biological processes are occurring leading to the cleanup objective. RAO may include active remediation, monitoring, operation, and optimization for extended periods of time to reduce contaminants to site cleanup standards; along with implementation & management/maintenance of Land Use Controls (LUCs). 
Long Term Management (LTM) occurs when the selected remedy has achieved the cleanup goals (possibly done under the RAC or RAO phase noted above), and hazardous substances remain at the site above levels that would allow unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. LTM may include long term monitoring, implementation and/or management of land use controls (LUCs), maintenance of the final remedy, and preparation of five year reviews. 
In addition to performance of the specific services listed above, the contractor will generally be responsible for maintaining records and preparation of written documents such as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan modifications, work plans, health & safety plans, sampling and analysis plans (SAP), and waste management plans connected with such services. The contractor may also be required to provide proposed solutions to technical problems and optimization. The work also includes performing indefinite quantity work such as maintenance, repair, and /or construction directed by the Contracting Officer via issued Task Orders.
Proposed Contract Task Order (CTO) ordering procedures: 
Each CTO will be initially awarded on a "fair opportunity" basis as outlined in FAR 16.505. Because the initial contracts will be awarded through a rigorous Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) process, we intend to make maximum use of the latitude allowed by the FAR to streamline CTO awards. Typically, only price and past performance will be considered. When required, we will maintain the ability to employ more rigorous evaluation criteria for CTO awards.
Follow-on CTOs will be ordered as an "exception to the fair opportunity process" as outlined in FAR 16.505. Because O&M/Long Term Monitoring (LTM) requires consistent management, it would be impractical to re-compete each CTO at its completion. Each awardee will have a fair opportunity to be considered for the original orders; however, we will attempt to negotiate subsequent follow-on CTOs on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency. If we are unable to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, we will reserve the right to compete the follow-on work on a "fair opportunity" basis to all contract awardees.
The range for individual task orders $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.
All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to respond. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone Small Business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement. If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals. All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The Government anticipates a contract award for these contracts in September 2010. The appropriate NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.
It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package not to exceed 5 pages. This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:
(1) Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated. Knowledge of the state regulations within the AOR. Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the work described, and a Government / Agency point of contact.
(2) Company profile, to include number of offices and number of employees per office, annual receipts, office location(s), available bonding capacity in excess of $16,000,000 per contract, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
(3) Please indicate if you are an 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, and Veteran Owned.
(4) In order to assist us in determining the geographic boundaries of the contract(s) necessary to cover the services of the proposed requirement within our AOR, please identify the geographic area in which you can operate in an efficient and economical manner.
The capabilities package for this sources sought notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this contract. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package. Submission of a capabilities package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey led by PMS 408, EOD/CREW Program Office, Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare (PEO LMW).  It is not a Request for Proposal.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

Background
The Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) initiative is meeting urgent and compelling operational requirements to counter the threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in order to reduce combat fatalities during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  This has resulted in a number of urgent procurements in past years.  

The Joint CREW I1B1 acquisition program (formerly JCREW 3.3) provides the military services with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from Radio-Controlled IEDs (RCIED).
 The JCREW System of Systems (SoS) approach includes three distinct systems that utilize common hardware, software and firmware components.  These systems are the: dismounted system (man-portable), mounted system (ground and waterborne), and fixed site system (semi-permanent geographical area and fixed).  The system architectures open, modular and flexible design ensures the ability to upgrade the product baseline for performance, affordability, availability and reliability reasons.  

PMS 408 EOD/CREW is using an Open Business philosophy and approach to extract maximum benefit from the JCREW I1B1 modular system architecture.  The JCREW open business acquisition strategy leverages the benefits of open architecture design elements to create the means for third-party technology innovators to participate in a coherent development, procurement and validation of system and sub-system level technology insertion /technology refresh (TI/TR).
  PMS 408 EOD/CREW plans for a series of incremental developments to enable:  1) two or three year technology insertion (updates cut into the existing production line) to include software, firmware or hardware, 2) a second incremental update four or six years after Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for architecture changes, and 3) periodic technology refresh (back fit actions on fielded systems) in order to maintain common baselines, to account for obsolescence and to counter the rapidly evolving threat.  

To successfully integrate third-party innovator hardware, software and firmware modules and components, PMS 408 plans to partner with and use a JCREW System Integrator.  The JCREW System Integrator would be responsible for validating component and module technology maturation levels (TRL 6 minimum and up) and for providing component, module, and system-level installation, integration, testing, measuring and reporting.
  This work is required to prove successful performance of new or different components and modules installed into the product baseline system architecture.  PMS 408 is issuing this RFI in order to gain an understanding of industrys technical capabilities, knowledge, experience, ability and interest to execute the JCREW System Integrator concept. 

Requested Information
The respondent is requested to provide information on the following:
(a)	Industrys recommendation regarding how they can help the Government execute JCREW System Integrator activities 
(b)	Industrys ability to quickly develop, issue, and effectively manage a number of small value, short term sub-contracts with technology innovators, some of whom may not be familiar with doing work for the U.S.
 Government
(c)	Alternative approaches to what has been described in this RFI
(d)	Identification of risks
(e)	Identification of cost drivers
(f)	Identification and examples of good communication and decision-making processes between the JCREW System Integrator and the Government
(g)	The pros, cons, desire and feasibility of having Government representatives resident at Industry facilities/locations; and/or vice versa
(h)	Suggestions for a cost effective approach to implement software, firmware and hardware upgrades to fielded systems. The suggested approach should maximize configuration control and balance kit production schedule while maintaining optimum system readiness; and 
(i)	Industry examples of demonstrated past experience in the JCREW System Integrator role.

Response Format
Interested parties who believe they are capable of performing as a JCREW System Integrator are invited to indicate their interest by providing; (a) company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; and (b) business size and unique qualifiers (e.g.
 large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.)

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word for Office 2007  compatible format.  RFI responses are limited to 15 pages, including cover and administrative pages.  Response documents shall be written using a 10 point font size or larger.

Questions may be submitted until 30 March 2011.  Each question submitted will be consolidated and published in an amendment to this RFI Request.  Questions should be submitted in writing to Vanessa.ochomogo@navy.mil or George.boateng@navy.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) 2011
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the USMC Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O) will take a procurement action in this matter. Neither E2O nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p>The USMC E2O is interested in gathering information to further its understanding of currently available technologies that could enhance the logistics sustainability of remote Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) engaged in combat operations. Specific areas of interest for this RFI include: (1) Concentrated solar harvesting technologies to produce power and hot water at remote FOBs; and (2) Technologies to increase tactical vehicle fuel efficiency while exporting power at idle or static conditions. Technologies of interest are those that would most rapidly and effectively enhance the self-sufficiency of FOBs roughly the size of a Marine Corps Company (approximately 200 Marines). Information is requested in the form of brief technology descriptions.</p>
<p>GENERAL BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>In March 2010, the USMC established its first temporary Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) at Quantico, Virginia. The ExFOB was established to provide industry with an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to enhance the USMC's self-sufficiency and reduce its need for fuel and water logistics. Following the first ExFOB Third Battalion, Fifth Marines (3/5) was trained and deployed to combat operations with renewable and energy efficient technologies demonstrated during this inaugural ExFOB. In less than a year technologies demonstrated at ExFOB were deployed to combat for further end-user evaluation, and have helped guide requirements and investment decisions.</p>
<p>In August 2010, ExFOB was established at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palms, California. Again technologies were identified that showed potential for reducing fuel and water demand on the battlefield. These technologies include hybrid PV-generator-battery systems, solar powered direct current (DC) air conditioners, and solar powered DC coolers. These systems will be evaluated further during the spring of 2011 to determine potential impact on the battlefield. If successful, deployment of these technologies for end-user evaluation and testing will occur during the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>The rapid deployment of 3/5 proved to be highly successful and has already resulted in changes to USMC's requirements documents, acquisitions, and investment decisions. ExFOB has provided the USMC the ability to mitigate decision making risks in an environment that vendors and government can collaborate real-time in the field with actual capabilities operating in a representative combat environment.</p>
<p>Information received in response to this RFI is intended to serve two purposes. (1) Technology descriptions will help formulate the Science , Technology and Acquisition planning necessary to mature technologies toward fieldable solutions; and (2) Technology descriptions may result in invitations for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their technologies at the ExFOB 2011 at no cost or risk to the Government, from 11 through 20 August 2011, if the manufacturer indicates that a product or prototype would be sufficiently developed for a conceptual demonstration by this date. This ExFOB event will be conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Army through their Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP) process.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:</p>
<p>Concentrated Solar Energy Harvesting: Solar energy is the only realistic renewable energy source available for harvesting in the expeditionary environment. During the first two ExFOB vendors demonstrated various traditional small scale photovoltaic (PV) solar technologies. The issue with small scale traditional PV technologies are low efficiency and large area required to harvest enough solar to support a company-sized FOB, approximately 5kW range and below. The USMC is interested in investigating solar concentrating technologies that reduce the area required to harvest solar energy at the 5kW and below. In addition to an interest in providing small renewable power the USMC is interested in concentrated solar technologies that produce hot-water for health and hygiene. Technologies of interest will demonstrate the ability to utilize solar energy to reduce fuel demand for company-sized FOBs. Possibilities might include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Concentrated Solar Harvesting Systems i.e., lens-focused PV, solar thermal dishes powering Sterline engines, etc.; and<br />2. Concentrated Passive Solar Water Heating</p>
<p>Increase Fuel Efficiency of Tactical Vehicles at Idle or Static: Often Marines at FOBs idle their tactical vehicles to provide power to critical combat systems like radios, laptops, blue force tracker, etc. For example, the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) can maintain 2.4kW of power to off-board equipment. To provide this power the MTVR consumes an average of .8 gallons of fuel per hour. This is a highly inefficient method to provide off-board power considering a typical 10kW tactical generator only consumes .92 gallons per hour. In addition, USMC tactical vehicles have become significantly less fuel efficient due to the addition of significant weight from armor and other Warfighter requirements, and continue to require increasing on-board power due to the demand of new electronic systems (i.e. IED jammers, radios, vision devices, communication equipment, etc.). Both of these issues result in greater fuel demand at FOBs, requiring significant logistics support that the USMC would like to reduce. The USMC is interested in improving the fuel efficiency of its tactical vehicles and looking for ways to more efficiently power both on and off-board electronic systems. Possibilities might include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Bolt-On Auxiliary Power Units;<br />2. Improve Fuel Efficiency at Idle/Stationary with No Degradation of Driving Performance; and<br />3. Improve overall fuel efficiency through improved engine/power train efficiencies, as well as any other automotive technologies such as cold and hot weather idle free solutions for vehicle climate control, reduction of parasitic loads, or any other automotive solutions designed to improve vehicle fuel efficiency.</p>
<p><br />SUBMISSION PROCESS AND DUE DATE:</p>
<p>The ExFOB team is partnered with the Army's Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP). Please go to the EMIP website below to determine how to submit information papers for technologies for the ExFOB 2011. The due date for all submissions is midnight on 29 April 2011. Additional information regarding the joint Army/USMC review process and the August 2011 EXFOB industry demonstration shall be provided to those who submit information papers pursuant to the standard Army Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP), Component Technology Demonstrations process at: http://peocscss.tacom.army.mil/EMIP/home.html</p>
<p>NOTE: This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market capability of sources and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.

<DESC>The PM JCTI-G and US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) are conducting a market survey to determine the level of interest among qualified contractors to provide low emissivity tape to the US Army.  The tape being sought shall meet or exceed the specification described within Specification Control Drawing No. 19202-11752013, dated 94-03-22, however the specification cannot be released to industry in support of this market survey due to the security classification of JCIMS technology.  The government is thus soliciting survey responses from commercial vendors whom manufacture and or distribute low emissivity tape that, when applied to CIPs, can perform the function described within the "Background" section above.

Contract proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15 and 35.007.<br />CONTRACT TYPE - NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of procurement vehicles using FAR/DFARS and/or non-procurement assistance vehicles using DoDGARS, such as Grants/Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 or Technology Incentive Awards under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or U.S.C. 2358 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. The appropriate contract/agreement type is ultimately determined by the Contracting Officer. Research may result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements, thereby providing flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of the contract, which resulted from this BAA, and therefore will have met FAR/DFARS requirements and the Competition in Contracting Act. <br />AWARDS - Contract awards will be based on the proposal's technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. <br />POINTS OF CONTACT - The offeror's may e-mail Dr. James Sheehy (james.sheehy@navy.mil) for technical issues, and Ms. Krista Hayden (krista.hayden@navy.mil) for contractual guidance.

<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Contracting Division (AFRL/RWK) is soliciting White Papers for the System of Systems Branch (AFRL/RWAS) on the following research effort: LONG RANGE STRIKE WEAPON (LRSW) TRADE STUDY. It is anticipated approximately two of the White Papers may be selected for further consideration, and their originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating two contracts for the LRSW study. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA. Contractors are encouraged to team together, but not required.</p>
<p>Introduction: The purpose of this BAA is for industry to assist in the planning and development of FY16 flight and ground test demonstration(s) of a long range strike weapon system. As envisioned, the LRSW will assist the Joint Force Commander by providing a responsive and survivable capability enabling the application of force to achieve desired effects against a variety of targets, to include time-critical, high-value and heavily defended targets, in various environments. In addition, the ability for LRSW to achieve effects rapidly over long distances provides the unique capability to hold targets in multiple areas of responsibility at risk, thus mitigating the problem of unexpected events. Based on user needs, AFRL has laid out a long range strike weapon capability concept with two major flight test demonstrations (GFY16 fixed target attack and GFY19 mobile target attack) and complementary ground demonstrations that will deliver basic and enhanced capabilities via a two-step approach. The overarching concept was derived from the Prompt Global Strike Analysis of Alternatives which identified a long range strike missile as an option to strike time sensitive and high value targets. Further analysis has been and is being performed under the AFRL Technologies for RESponsive Precision Air Strike (TRESPAS) and Technology for RESponsive Precision Air Land Sea Strike (TRESPALS2) studies that will help focus requirements and concepts from the warfighters within a system-of-systems context. Through an AFRL process, the multi-directorate demonstrations will leverage technology investments in munitions, propulsion, airframe, materials, information, and sensors areas. <br /><br /><br />Program Objective:</p>
<p>General Program Objective: The objective of this program is to develop the plan to design, fabricate, and test a set of high speed weapon technology experiments that will result in the successful user-driven flight and ground test demonstrations in GFY16 of a high speed weapon engaging a fixed target. <br /><br />Specific Program Objectives: The contractor team shall perform analyses and trade studies to define the best functional characteristics of the high speed weapon system for the demonstration(s). The contractor team shall review and decompose the functional subcomponents to ensure all requirements are met through the use of simulation, ground testing, and flight testing. The program shall include study in the areas of aeroconfiguration, materials, propulsion, warhead, GN&amp;C, etc., and associated costs and schedules for each demonstration. The government will use these cost figures for funding appropriations. The LRSW demonstration requirements, Annex 1, will be provided in accordance with the instructions found in Section 8(d) below.<br /><br />(1) Requirements:&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is interested in multiple, diverse approaches to achieving the program objectives. The contractor team should consider one or more solutions that fall within the range of capabilities and characteristics that are described in Annex 1. <br />At the kickoff meeting, the government will provide data regarding the objective threat environment, to guide the contractor team in selection of weapon speed, observability, and maneuver characteristics.</p>
<p>(2) Program Tasking: The task is anticipated to include design, analysis, modeling and simulation, demonstration test plan development, and cost analysis. Information products will contribute to the development of the Air Force's systems engineering strategy for LRSW.</p>
<p>a. Trade Study: The contractor team shall perform analyses and trade studies to define the best functional characteristics of the high speed weapon system for the demonstration(s). The contractor shall present the draft results of the trade study to the Government for approval at the interim review.</p>
<p>b. Test Plan: The contractor shall design a test plan(s) to meet or exceed the requirements that include all ground and flight testing and an associated cost estimate. The contractor shall identify all necessary GFE and other assets, if any, to include T&amp;E centers and incorporate them into the test plan.</p>
<p>c. Design Analysis: The contractor shall conduct analyses as necessary to predict and validate interdependencies of the weapons components to meet the requirements and validate subsystem/component functional characteristics.</p>
<p>d. Modeling and Simulation: The contractor shall perform necessary modeling and simulation to predict performance requirements.</p>
<p>e. Hardware: The contractor shall identify hardware needed for testing (either by fabrication or otherwise) along with associated costs.</p>
<p>f. Low Cost Producibility: The contractor shall consider design practices for low cost producibility in the design of the long range strike weapon and demonstrator. The contractor shall provide a unit cost of production estimate for 10 units and 1000 units based on industry/government accepted standards for cost analysis.</p>
<p>(3) Risk: The contractor shall identify risks associated with recommended technologies and ground and flight tests for all phases of the Long Range Strike Weapon Technology Demonstration Program. The contractor is responsible for utilizing a risk evaluation process, determining all major demonstration risks, assigning values to those risks, and developing mitigations for those risks. The contractor team shall make risk evaluation a component of all technical reviews.</p>
<p>(4) Management: The contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements of this effort, including but not limited to: cost, technical, safety, schedule, security and subcontractor management. The contractor shall communicate the technical and programmatic status through Data Requirements submissions discussed in section/paragraph I(5) and scheduled meetings discussed in section/paragraph I(6). In addition to the interim and final reviews, informal program status interchanges (such as weekly teleconferences) are encouraged. <br /><br />(5) Data Requirements: The following data submittals are expected to be required for each contract awarded;</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>DESCRIPTION:  Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2), the Army is soliciting proposals to conduct a research and development effort to further advances in turboshaft engine combustion technologies for use in current and future rotorcraft.  Offerors shall submit proposals conforming to the guidelines stated in this announcement.  This BAA constitutes the total solicitation for this research and development effort.  There will be no other solicitations or announcements issued in regards to this effort.<br><br>INTRODUCTION:  The Army is anticipating the development of new centerline turboshaft engines, as well as upgrades to current engines, for use in current and Future Force rotorcraft.  In order to meet range and lift requirements of the Future Force, these new and improved engines need to provide significantly increased power to weight ratio and reduced specific fuel consumption, while addressing affordability and life/durability. In order to meet the aggressive goals of these future engines, significant advancement in combustion systems technology will be required.<br><br>The aggressive performance requirements that must be addressed by Future Force engines dictate a need for significantly increased temperatures and pressures with no compromise in component lives and durability.  Improved affordability of these advanced designs is also needed. These conditions create significant challenges for the individual combustion system components within the turboshaft engine.  Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop and validate critical advanced combustion system technologies that improve the performance, life/durability, and affordability necessary to enable Future Force turboshaft engines to meet the warfighter needs. Offeror must substantiate the engine level performance, cost and life/durability gains achievable with the proposed technologies relative to a representative turboshaft engine design that is relevant to future Army aviation systems or demonstrator programs such as the Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) and Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) Programs.  This program seeks to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of candidate advanced combustor systems technologies from a TRL 2 to a TRL 4.  TRL 2 is defined as developing the technology concept and/or application, while TRL 4 is defined as having completed component validation in a lab environment.  <br>  <br>REQUIREMENTS:  <br><br>1. Technical Description:  It is the Government's desire to conduct a technology development effort focused on advanced combustion systems technologies for current and Future Force turboshaft engines. The offeror shall define the anticipated combustor configuration and performance characteristics consistent with the goals identified below. The combustor design shall be substantiated to achieve the following:   <br><br> 	Combustor Exit Temperature (T4) (value to be provided upon request)<br> 	  0.15 Pattern Factor<br> 	  0.06 Radial Profile Factor at 50-70% Root-to-tip Span<br> 	  30% weight reduction (relative to year 2000 state of the art)<br> 	  6,000 hours and 15,000 cycles (cold parts)/7,500 cycles (liners) before crack initiation life goals<br><br>The offeror shall substantiate the current state-of-the-art relative to the above goals and for any other relevant technology measurement parameters. The offeror shall then substantiate the expected improvements in these parameters (over the state-of-the-art) provided by incorporation of the proposed technologies into the combustor design. The offeror shall substantiate the potential payoffs from incorporation of the proposed combustor technologies into current and Future Force engines.<br><br>The offeror shall design, fabricate, and perform validation testing of the proposed combustor technologies considered critical to combustor goal achievement.  Validation testing shall be conducted at the bench and/or rig level in an environment that simulates notional engine operational conditions and shall be performed to validate aerodynamic, thermal, and/or mechanical performance.<br><br>The Future Advanced Combustor Technology program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program. Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful Offerors, such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation.<br><br>2. Deliverable Items:  All agreements will require delivery of the following items: (1) Program Plan (delivered 45 days after contract award), (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Test Plans, (4) Quarterly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (5) Final Report, (6) Final Briefing (Note: Each of these items shall be delivered in Contractor's format)<br><br>3. Security Requirements:  This effort will likely generate technical data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only those offerors registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and that have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this Broad Agency Announcement. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification process. Offerors must submit a copy of the offeror's approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with its proposal.  Those offerors considered to be under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) must have a Defense Security Service (DSS) approved Special Security Agreement (SSA) or other approved mitigation plan prior to submission of offers, see National Industrial Security Procedures Operating Manual (NISPOM), Department of Defense (DoD) Manual 5220.22-M, Chapter 2, Section 3. The Government does not anticipate the generation of classified data as part of this effort.<br><br>Additional information needed by the offerors during proposal preparation will be provided upon request from the contract specialist, Mr. Michael Leonard, 757-878-0086.  A Form 2345 must be filled out by the offeror and submitted to Mr. Michael Leonard to gain access to the export controlled information. The following information will be provided upon request when the proper paperwork and request have been submitted: Value of Combustor Exit Temperature (T4) goal.<br><br>4. Other Special Requirements:  None<br><br><br>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br><br>1. Anticipated Period of Performance: 39 Months Total (36 technical and 3 for Data/Final Report)<br><br>2. Expected Award Date:  August 2011<br><br>3. Available Government Funds:  Government Share = $1,500,000 (Distribution FY11/12-$500K, FY13-$500K, FY14-$500K).  Government cost estimate indicates a single viable program can be done without industry cost share.  Industry cost share will provide opportunity for enhanced programs.<br><br>4. Government Furnished Property:  None<br><br>5. Type of Funding Instrument:  The Government prefers offerors propose a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358), which is more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used.  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy. Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented.  Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) is also an acceptable funding instrument.  Parties proposing TIAs must provide at least half of the costs of the project to the maximum extent practicable.  This is a statutory condition for those TIAs under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and is a matter of DoD policy for all other TIAs.  The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf. The type of funding instrument is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire shall be clearly stated in the cost proposal.<br><br>6. Size Status:  Due to complexity and technical considerations of this program, this BAA is not set-aside for small businesses.  <br><br>7. Late Proposals: Late proposals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c), "Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition"<br><br>PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>1. General:  Six (6) paper copies of the proposal shall be delivered to AATD Contracting Division.  One reproducible copy shall be electronic in PDF format.<br><br>2. Cost Proposal:  The cost proposal shall include the following:  a) A funding profile of cost and man-hours by month totaled by Government fiscal year for each task and the total program; b) Cost at the total program level showing all cost elements by cost category (including applicable rates and factors) by year (calendar or contractor year used to develop proposed rates and factors).  c) Present all costs by cost category by separate individual tasks (i.e., Design, Fabrication, Testing, Management and Reporting) by Government fiscal year in order to facilitate selection and potential award of individual parts of the proposed effort and d) display cost share for each Government fiscal year. Subcontractor/subrecipient proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, shall be provided concurrent with the offeror's submission of its proposal. Subcontractor/subrecipient proposals may be provided directly to the Government to protect proprietary cost data. Any resulting agreement value will exclude recipient's "sunk" costs of prior research as cost match. Only additional resources that will be provided by the recipient to carry out the current project will be counted towards an offeror's proposed cost share.  The cost proposal shall not contain overflow of information suited for the technical proposal.  Any technical information in the cost proposal will not be evaluated.  In the case of any conflict between the technical and cost proposals, cost information in the cost proposal will take precedence. Proposals must be submitted in original and five (5) copies.  You are encouraged to submit cost proposals on electronic media using Microsoft Excel 2007 or compatible. Electronic cost data submission does not relieve the offeror from the responsibility for submission of an original signed hard copy of the cost proposal along with all supporting rationale. <br><br>3. Technical Proposal:  The technical proposal shall provide a clear justification for the selection of the proposed advanced combustion systems technology. The justification/rational supporting the proposed technology shall be based upon the potential contribution of this technology to current and Future Force turboshaft engines. The offeror shall define the anticipated combustor configuration and performance characteristics that satisfy the quantitative goals identified in the Technical Description section above.  The offeror shall substantiate the current state-of-the-art relative to these goals and for any other relevant technology measurement parameters. The offeror shall then substantiate the expected improvements in these parameters (over the state-of-the-art) provided by incorporation of the proposed technologies into the combustor design. The proposal shall include a Statement of Work (SOW) that utilizes the following general task outline:  1) Task I - Design; 2) Task II - Fabrication; 3) Task III - Validation Testing; and Task IV - Management and Reporting.  The technical proposal shall also include a clear statement of the program objectives and the specific approach to be pursued and supporting background experience.  It shall also contain program milestones, a brief biographical section describing key personnel, a brief description of the facilities/capabilities to be employed in the effort, and a program management section.  The offeror will also identify how the proposed propulsion technology is integral to its ongoing efforts to develop or support an Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) for VAATE.<br><br>4.

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Solicitation # W91LV2STPETERSBURG is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 21-26 March 2011 in the St. Petersburg, FL area. This procurement is being issued as a small business set aside. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. <br>Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5 M to $30 M.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.

The National Park Service, Yosemite National Park (YOSE) has identified a requirement for a contract to purchase #2 Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuel for NPS equipment and vehicles. In order for the National Park Service (NPS) to accomplish its day to day operations and emergency operations, it is necessary to purchase diesel fuel to continually have fuel available in the NPS fuel tanks for NPS equipment and vehicles.  The fuel will have to be supplied to maintain adequate and reliable levels of service for the park operations, especially during the winter months for snow removal and sanding operations to keep the roads passable and safe.  The fuel is critical for the National Park Service to accomplish the parks day to day operations and mission. The Chinquapin Vehicle tank has a 1000 gallon capacity and the Wawona tanks are 2000 gallons each. The fuel deliveries are dependent upon the amount of bad weather and the usage of equipment.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO LEASE SPACE

The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to lease office space for a firm period of five (5) years with five (5) annual option periods after the firm term. The Government will consider offers to lease 8835 to 9995 sq ft of office space that at least meet the general requirements that follow below. The general requirements are not the full solicitation. They are the basic requirements which describe the government's minimum needs and thus establishes the potential of offerors to submit responsive proposals. Offerors whose space fulfills the general requirements shall contact the Contracting Officer to schedule a date and time for the evaluation team to inspect the potential space. After initial inspection, the full solicitation will be issued to offerors whose space is eligible for consideration. The initial proposals will be due not later than April 14, 2011 but may be considered up to lease award.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1.1  AMOUNT AND TYPE OF SPACE (AUG 2008)
 
   A. The Department of Veterans Affairs is interested in leasing approximately 9,995 rentable square feet of space. The rentable space shall yield a minimum of 8,830 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet to a maximum of 9,995 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet, available for use by tenant for personnel, furnishings, and equipment. Refer to the "Measurement of Space" paragraph in the UTILITIES, SERVICES AND LEASE ADMINISTRATION section of this Solicitation for Offers (SFO).
 
   B. The Government requires 5 reserved parking spaces. These spaces shall be secured and lit in accordance with the Security Section in this Solicitation. The cost of this parking shall be included as part of the rental consideration.
 
   C. The offer shall 1) be for space located in a quality building of sound and substantial construction as described in this SFO, 2) have a potential for efficient layout, 3) be within the ABOA square footage range to be considered, and 4) be in compliance with all of the Government's minimum requirements set forth herein.
 
   D. The design of the space offered shall be conducive to efficient layout and good utilization as determined by the Government. To demonstrate potential for efficient layout, the Offeror may be requested to provide a test fit layout at the Offeror's expense when the space offered contains certain features like:
 
     1. Narrow column spacing;
 
     2. Atriums, light wells, or other areas interrupting contiguous spaces;
 
     3. Extremely long, narrow runs of space;
 
     4. Irregular space configurations; or
 
     5. Other unusual building features.
 
     6. The Government will advise the Offeror if the test fit layout demonstrates that the Government's requirement cannot be accommodated within the space offered. The Offeror will have the option of increasing the ANSI/BOMA Office Area square footage offered, provided that it does not exceed the maximum ANSI/BOMA Office Area square footage in this SFO. If the Offeror is already providing the maximum ANSI/BOMA Office Area square footage and cannot house the Government's space requirements efficiently, then the Government will advise the Offeror that the offer is unacceptable.
 
   E. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this SFO to square feet shall mean ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (ABOA). The terms ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) and usable square feet (usf) are used interchangeably throughout this SFO and its attachments.
 
   F. As part of this space requirement, the Government will require use of part of the building roof for the installation of antenna(s). Further specifications regarding the type of antenna(s) and mounting requirements are included as an attachment to this SFO.
 
   G. Approximately 0 square feet of the ANSI/BOMA Office Area space required above will be used for the operation of a vending facility(ies) by the blind under the provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (United States Code 20 USC 107 et. seq.). The Government will control the number, kind, and locations of vending facilities and will control and receive income from all automatic vending machines. The Lessor is required to provide necessary utilities and to make related alterations. The cost of the improvements will be negotiated, and payment will be made by the Government either on a lump-sum basis or a rental increase.
 
   The Government will not compete with other facilities having exclusive rights in the building. The Offeror shall advise the Government if such rights exist. During the term of the lease, the Lessor may not establish any vending facilities within the leased space that will compete with the Randolph-Sheppard vending facilities.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance ("TA") on the proposed Children's Hospital project ("Project") in Nigeria ("Host Country"). The TA will provide CAMC with recommendations regarding equipment, methods, and procedures consistent with industry best practices as CAMC strives to become Nigeria's first internationally accredited pediatric specialist facility.</p>
<p>CAMC was established in Nigeria in 2007 by founder and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ikwunga Wonodi, a Nigerian-American doctor currently practicing psychiatry in the U.S. CAMC's board of directors is comprised of Sir Patrick Sule Ugboma, Director of a Nigerian insurance company, who serves as Chairman of the Board, Dr. Adora Okogbule-Wonodi, a practicing pediatrician who serves as the Chief Medical Director, and Mr. Chukwuemeka Ndu, Managing Director of a Nigerian leasing company, who serves as Chief Financial Director.</p>
<p>The Children's Hospital is envisioned as an 80 bed hospital which would feature a neonatal intensive care unit, biomedical research laboratory, teaching facilities, and a children's health outreach program. In addition to recommending equipment, practices and procedures, the USTDA-funded TA grant will assist CAMC in reaching out to prospective private-sector sponsors in the Lagos area who may be willing to fund the cost of treatment for patients who might not otherwise be able to afford medical care.</p>
<p>The objective of the USTDA-funded TA is to assist CAMC in planning the hospital's clinical services, facilities and support infrastructure, personnel needs, medical equipment, information technology systems, and telemedicine equipment for remote diagnosis services. Following these consultations, the Contractor will also deliver a series of workshops in Lagos targeting U.S. companies in the health sector, financing entities, Nigerian Federal and Lagos State health officials, prospective donors and sponsors, owners of local private hospitals, and consumer groups. The workshops will serve to bring the project's stakeholders together to supplement the consultations and highlight opportunities for the further involvement of the Contractor, and other U.S. health sector companies in the Nigerian health sector. The Contractor's recommendations shall be consistent with the standards set forth by the Joint Commission for International Accreditation.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $289,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit an electronic copy of their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm Local (Lagos) Time, on May 13, 2011 at the above e-mail address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.
 
   (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

     (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
 
     (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
 
     (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
 
     (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
 
     (7) The Standard Form 1449.
 
     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
 
     (9) The specification.
 
   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

The 5 mm ligasure is an essential instrument use in the way to perform minimally invasive foregut surgery.  A gentile tissue coagulator with a dissecting tip and it coagulates only between its jaws with very little collateral energy spread. 

It has a fixed arm and an open/ close arm it is shaped like a wedge in order to facilitate dissection as well as sliding into the correct tissue plains. Device is proven in sealing blood vessels up to 7 mm in size so it enables safe ligation of arteries that come directly off the aorta and feed the esophagus as well as bronchial vessels and short gastric vessels.

The harmonic scalpel gives a lot of collateral energy/ heat making it less safe to use around critical tissue (ie the lymph node dissection between the esophagus and posterior membranous wall of the airway)

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance/Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI program funded USPSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. The Personnel and Operations Specialist position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI requires a Personnel and Operations Specialist who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI's Operations and Management Division (OTI/OMD) in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting, managing and streamlining office-wide systems, processes and procedures; as well as the creation of an enhanced response capability through dynamic teamwork, quick responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and enthusiastic customer service. The division supports a world-wide majority program-funded workforce through two teams, a Personnel Support Team (human resources and personnel support for program-funded personnel), and Operations Support Team (finance, information and technology, and procurement tracking).</p>
<p>The Personnel and Operations Specialist is integrally involved in all aspects of the award and maintenance of program funded staff that support OTI country programs overseas. The Personnel and Operations Specialist provides technical assistance to ensure a range of procurement actions are executed efficiently and effectively, with a particular focus on program-funded U.S. Personal Service Contractor (USPSC) employee positions worldwide. The Personnel and Operations Specialist supervises a small staff of USPSCs (currently two Personnel Assistants) and oversees the work of an institutional contractor providing USPSC contracts support.</p>
<p>The Personnel and Operations Specialist works closely with the Human Resources Specialist for PSCs, reports to the Personnel Support Team Leader, and is supervised by the Chief, Operations and Management Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Amendment 6 - contractor questions and government respose are posted at AQD website http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/ (and select Business Community, Solicitations, Open Market Solicitations) or copy and paste the following link:http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/openmarket.aspx
1)     For import of the equipment to the locations in the middle east would it be possible to use a diplomatic pouch if necessary? 
Response: U.S. Government will assist with logistics for equipment shipments and handling. 
2)      Security - will we need to hire guards or will we have local assistance at all times?   
Response:  U.S. Government will work with Embassies and Consulates to determine and provide guidance on security requirements at time of travel.
  3)      Will the surface water monitoring stations be at an existing station or at a new site? 
Response:    Existing Stations.  4)     What are the conditions at the sites of the surface water monitoring stations?
Response:   Two stations:  1)  Concrete reservoir at developed site; 2) Concrete bridge/platform over small stream.  Existing monitoring system to be adapted and retrofit for new system. 
5)  Which constituents are you looking to sample automatically from groundwater, or are you only looking to measure groundwater level automatically? 
Response:  automatically (real-time) from groundwater"	water depth "	temperature "	dissolved oxygen "	conductivity"	pH"	Oxidation reduction potential (ORP)"	turbidity"	ammonium/ammonia*"	phosphate*"	nitrate* *USDA may be open to monitoring these parameters with hand-held units if real-time collection is deemed cost prohibitive. Please include in quote.  
6)     Are the surface water monitoring stations existing (e.g. is there a metal box) or are we expected to provide a quote that includes constructing the station in addition to supplying and setting up the equipment? 
Response:  Please provide quote that includes an equipment station set-up that would be self sufficient.  One site has an existing system that may or may not be usable.  
7)     While the RFQ seems to encourage purchase of American goods, is it acceptable to purchase equipment from a local distributor if the equipment is manufactured in the US? 
Response:  Bulk of equipment  is recommended American made.  Additional supplies and materials (i.e. piping, small parts, etc.) can be procured locally if available and/or accessible.

<p>Prospective sources are reminded that an award can only be made to a Contractor who is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>All questions shall be submitted to Michelle Croan, Contracting Officer, at croan.michelle@epa.gov.</p>
<p>Late responses, received after the due date/time, will not be considered for award. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure that all documents and quotes are received by the due time and date listed above.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>REPORT PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON A POTENTIAL REVISION OF 10 CFR 190</p>
<p><br />PROJECT OFFICER:</p>
<p>Brian Littleton<br />202- 343-9216</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Date of award through September 30, 2012</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Radiation Protection Division, is interested in identifying options and issues as it looks at potentially revising 40 CFR Part 190. For this action, we are specifically interested in potential changes to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). As we potentially move to a new phase of nuclear power in the 21st century, the Agency wants to better understand if the current 33 year old standards are relevant, environmentally protective and enforceable. Because Section 190.10(b) addresses issues that would affect spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, any changes to this section would be controversial. If EPA were to change this section, our goal would be for it to be environmentally protective. EPA has nost taken a position on the issue of reprocessing, however, it is a possibility for which EPA's regulations need to adequately account.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The primary goal of this work would be for a nationally recognized group to develop a document which will provide technical recommendation to EPA on a targeted technical issues to be addressed in a potential revision of 40 CFR 190.10(b) The recommendations provided in the document would be focused on issues, such as the use of collective dose, impacting the "radionuclide cap" aspect of its regulation as stated in 40 CFR Part 190.10(b).</p>
<p>The proposed work would help identify key issues and suggest technical options for protecting human health and the environment from radiation releases for nuclear power operations. These technical options will need to address what would need to be considered by the Agency if it were to follow any particular option related to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). The document will bring up specific topics in a systematic manner and receive input from technical experts on each issue. When possible, consensus regarding an issue will be noted. However, consensus of several of these issues may not be possible. If this is the case, then the goal of the document will be to provide various approaches that the Agency could take with regards to an issue, and discuss the technical strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This document will be published by the contactor in an appropriate format (formal Proceedings, Commentary, Report, etc.)</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Agency is seeking expert consultation from qualified scientists and experts in radiation matters. Merit shall be given to quotes which include consultation of experts such as past and/or present members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Council or Radiation Protection and measurement, the Agency's Science Advisory Board, and/or other recognized independent technical advisory organizations.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following support: convene a group of technical experts for the purpose of soliciting opinions and recommendations regarding manners to protect the public from exposure to radiation resulting from nuclear energy operations covered by 40 CFR Part 190.10(b), which will focus on 10(b). The contractor shall propose the manner with which it will fulfill this criteria (ie How will information be obtained from each expert: How will consensus be sought and what criteria will be used to determine consensus; In what manner will the findings be published, etc). The quote shall address proposed personnel and the manner for publishing the findings.</p>
<p>Specific topics to be addressed in the final documentation include the following:</p>
<p>1. Radionuclide Inventory - Are the suite of radionuclide's specified in the existing standard (kr-85, I-129 and Pu-239 and other alpha-emitting TRU) those radionuclide's of highest concern? Should some radionuclide's be eliminated from the regulated list? Should some radionuclide's be added to the current list?</p>
<p>2. Strengths and weaknesses of current approach - Are the original objectives of the Agency's standard still reasonable? Is the concept of environmental dose commitment a desirable endpoint? Should any regulatory action continue to use an endpoint, local, regional, national, and worldwide populations? How has it worked in the 33 years of the regulations? Is it appropriate to consider the following three points of view 1) the potential public health impact attributable to each radioactive material, 2) the combined potential public health impact of various components of the fuel cycle, 3) the integrated public health impact of the entire fuel cycle due to projected future growth?</p>
<p>3. Alternate Approaches - Given the information collected in the previous tasks, what are the potential alternative options that the Agency could use in revising 190.10(b), and what are the issues, and technical strengths, and weaknesses associated with those options. For example, would a combination of approaches be appropriate, such as maintaining a cap based on collective dose considerations, while establishing a facility based limit as well? Would the existing standard be more practicable (e.g., enforceable, protective) on a facility by facility basis? The Agency understands that cost information may be difficult to obtain, however, the Agency would like to understand the different options' their relative costs so that the Agency could understand if a particular approach is so costly it would not be attempted.</p>
<p><br />The deliverables for this work assignment shall be:</p>
<p>1. A draft consultation report which summarizes the communications of the technical workgroup. The report will note any consensus recommendations that resulted from the communications and any major issues where differences were noted.</p>
<p>2. A final consultation report which clarifies any questions that the EPA Project Officer may have regarding issues covered in the report.</p>
<p><br />SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>TASK NO: DELIVERABLE DUE DATE<br />Task 1: Draft Consultation/Report Within 12 Months of Contract Award<br />Task 2: Final Consultation/Report Within 15 Months of Contract Award</p>

Facilitator Experience<br />f. Expertise of Participants</p>
<p>3. Experience with Similar Work - The Government will evaluate each offeror's experience performing projects of a similar size, scope, and complexity, and each offeror's past performance of projects based upon customer feedback with the services provided on past or current projects. <br />a. Demonstrated applicability to environmental regulation development<br />b. Complexity of recommendations<br />c. Customer feedback from past performance</p>
<p>4. Past Performance - The Government will evaluate each offeror's past performance of projects based upon customer satisfaction with the services provided on past or current projects</p>
<p>5. Cost/Price - The Government will evaluate the total expected cost of performing this work.</p>
<p>Quote Submission Instructions</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a detailed project plan (not to exceed 5 pages), describing the Offeror's ability to satisfy the Government's requirement as set forth in the Statement of Work, including the labor classifications/technical expertise to accomplish each section of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Additionally, each offeror shall identify up to three contracts, which have recently been performed (within the last 3 years), or are currently performing, which are similar in scope for services of this magnitude and complexity. The offeror shall provide the following information with respect to each of these contracts:</p>
<p>*Contract number, contract type and dollar value<br />*Date of contract award and period of performance<br />*Name, address and telephone number of all applicable contract points of contact<br />*Brief description of contract work, scope, and responsibilities</p>
<p>In addition to considering past performance information provided in the offeror's submission, past performance evaluations may also be based on the offeror's supplied references, information obtained through federal performance tracking databases, and other information obtained by the Government from other sources.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a firm, fixed-price quote, including indirect costs, other direct costs (ODCs), travel and any other applicable charges, providing a ceiling price for this requirement.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall submit (1) one electronic copy to Michelle Croan, Contracting Officer, at croan.michelle@epa.gov and (1) one electronic copy to Brian Littleton, Project Officer, at littleton.brian@epa.gov. Due date for receipt of responses to this RFQ will be 9:00 AM, Eastern Time, on March 18, 2011.</p>
<p>Prospective sources are reminded that an award can only be made to a Contractor who is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>All questions shall be submitted to Michelle Croan, Contracting Officer, at croan.michelle@epa.gov.</p>
<p>Late responses, received after the due date/time, will not be considered for award. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure that all documents and quotes are received by the due time and date listed above.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>REPORT PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON A POTENTIAL REVISION OF 40 CFR 190</p>
<p><br />PROJECT OFFICER:</p>
<p>Brian Littleton<br />202- 343-9216</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Date of award through September 30, 2012</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Radiation Protection Division, is interested in identifying options and issues as it looks at potentially revising 40 CFR Part 190. For this action, we are specifically interested in potential changes to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). As we potentially move to a new phase of nuclear power in the 21st century, the Agency wants to better understand if the current 33 year old standards are relevant, environmentally protective and enforceable. Because Section 190.10(b) addresses issues that would affect spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, any changes to this section would be controversial. If EPA were to change this section, our goal would be for it to be environmentally protective. EPA has nost taken a position on the issue of reprocessing, however, it is a possibility for which EPA's regulations need to adequately account.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The primary goal of this work would be for a nationally recognized group to develop a document which will provide technical recommendation to EPA on a targeted technical issues to be addressed in a potential revision of 40 CFR 190.10(b) The recommendations provided in the document would be focused on issues, such as the use of collective dose, impacting the "radionuclide cap" aspect of its regulation as stated in 40 CFR Part 190.10(b).</p>
<p>The proposed work would help identify key issues and suggest technical options for protecting human health and the environment from radiation releases for nuclear power operations. These technical options will need to address what would need to be considered by the Agency if it were to follow any particular option related to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). The document will bring up specific topics in a systematic manner and receive input from technical experts on each issue. When possible, consensus regarding an issue will be noted. However, consensus of several of these issues may not be possible. If this is the case, then the goal of the document will be to provide various approaches that the Agency could take with regards to an issue, and discuss the technical strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This document will be published by the contactor in an appropriate format (formal Proceedings, Commentary, Report, etc.)</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Agency is seeking expert consultation from qualified scientists and experts in radiation matters. Merit shall be given to quotes which include consultation of experts such as past and/or present members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Council or Radiation Protection and measurement, the Agency's Science Advisory Board, and/or other recognized independent technical advisory organizations.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following support: convene a group of technical experts for the purpose of soliciting opinions and recommendations regarding manners to protect the public from exposure to radiation resulting from nuclear energy operations covered by 40 CFR Part 190.10(b), which will focus on 10(b). The contractor shall propose the manner with which it will fulfill this criteria (ie How will information be obtained from each expert: How will consensus be sought and what criteria will be used to determine consensus; In what manner will the findings be published, etc). The quote shall address proposed personnel and the manner for publishing the findings.</p>
<p>Specific topics to be addressed in the final documentation include the following:</p>
<p>1. Radionuclide Inventory - Are the suite of radionuclide's specified in the existing standard (kr-85, I-129 and Pu-239 and other alpha-emitting TRU) those radionuclide's of highest concern? Should some radionuclide's be eliminated from the regulated list? Should some radionuclide's be added to the current list?</p>
<p>2. Strengths and weaknesses of current approach - Are the original objectives of the Agency's standard still reasonable? Is the concept of environmental dose commitment a desirable endpoint? Should any regulatory action continue to use an endpoint, local, regional, national, and worldwide populations? How has it worked in the 33 years of the regulations? Is it appropriate to consider the following three points of view 1) the potential public health impact attributable to each radioactive material, 2) the combined potential public health impact of various components of the fuel cycle, 3) the integrated public health impact of the entire fuel cycle due to projected future growth?</p>
<p>3. Alternate Approaches - Given the information collected in the previous tasks, what are the potential alternative options that the Agency could use in revising 190.10(b), and what are the issues, and technical strengths, and weaknesses associated with those options. For example, would a combination of approaches be appropriate, such as maintaining a cap based on collective dose considerations, while establishing a facility based limit as well? Would the existing standard be more practicable (e.g., enforceable, protective) on a facility by facility basis? The Agency understands that cost information may be difficult to obtain, however, the Agency would like to understand the different options' their relative costs so that the Agency could understand if a particular approach is so costly it would not be attempted.</p>
<p><br />The deliverables for this work assignment shall be:</p>
<p>1. A draft consultation report which summarizes the communications of the technical workgroup. The report will note any consensus recommendations that resulted from the communications and any major issues where differences were noted.</p>
<p>2. A final consultation report which clarifies any questions that the EPA Project Officer may have regarding issues covered in the report.</p>
<p><br />SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>TASK NO: DELIVERABLE DUE DATE<br />Task 1: Draft Consultation/Report Within 12 Months of Contract Award<br />Task 2: Final Consultation/Report Within 15 Months of Contract Award</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought is NOT a request for competitive proposals and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished. This is NOT a request for proposal or invitation for bid. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government assumes no responsibility for costs incurred by the contractor in responding to this Sources Sought. These costs remain solely the responsibility of the responding contractor and response is voluntary.
<p>The 416 SCMS is conducting efforts to repair the Meggitt F-16 Single Seat Canopy actuator NSN 1680-01-505-0663. Meggitt Safety Systems was selected by the 416th Supply Chain Management Squadron as the qualified supplier for the F-16 single place canopy actuator. A 2008 risk assessment determined an undesirable risk existed for free falling canopies. The Meggitt canopy actuator was designed to eliminate this risk and replace the past canopy actuators that have not met critical safety requirements. The Meggitt actuator was determined to conform to the mission's Operational, Suitability, Safety, and Effectiveness requirements for the weapon system. Meggitt Safety Systems is currently the only qualified source. The Meggitt actuator is a custom designed and manufactured asset that is used only on single seat F-16s. Meggitt owns the proprietary data needed to repair the Meggitt actuators. However, any companies that feel they have the capability to repair this asset are welcome to contact F-16 engineering and pursue qualification. Source qualification can take anywhere from a couple months up to&nbsp;two years and IAW FAR 9.202(e), future contract award will not be delayed for demonstration by a contactor to meet the standards specified in the QR.</p>
<p>Interested organizations who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information; point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, duns number, cage code and/or tax ID number, as well as size category (large, small, small disadvantaged, etc), a brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and existing safety approvals.</p>
<p>Provide any supporting information such as catalogues, manuals, etc. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must meet the criteria specified herein as well.</p>
<p>Responses to this Notice are due on or before 7 April 2011. Parties interested in repairing the F-16 Single Seat Canopy Actuator will be required to become a qualified source, in accordance with the attached Source Qualification Statement (SQS).</p>
<p>All technical questions shall be made to the Technical Point of Contact provided.</p>

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Request for Information (RFI) is one method the Air Force is using to conduct its market research. The results of market research will be used to develop an acquisition strategy and to determine if this A&amp;AS effort should be small business set-aside or full and open competition.</p>
<p>Due to the length of time that has transpired from the date of the Air Force's original market research up until the present time, the Air Force has decided that additional market research needs to be accomplished to assess the current market capabilities.</p>
<p>As a result, this SSS/RFI is being released again for responses. There have been some changes made in some of the documentation associated with this SSS/RFI. The changes that have been made are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Air Force is now anticipating that the award will be a multiple award IDIQ contract as opposed to the previously stated "one year basic period from date of award plus four one-year options."</p>
<p>2. The following sentence is removed from the synopsis description: "If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used."</p>
<p>3. In the synopsis description, remove the sentence "The capabilities package should not exceed 10 pages." Collectively, the answers to the RFI Questions and the capabilities package should not exceed 20 pages.</p>
<p>4. The third question on the attachment titled "RFI Questions" has been changed. The words "(or your plan to obtain those capabilities)" have been added. The new document is titled "RFI Questions Revision 2."</p>
<p>5. The Statement of Objectives (SOO) has been revised significantly. The new SOO is titled AFNWC/ICBMSD A&amp;AS SOO and is dated 14 March 2011.</p>
<p>Due to the changes made to the SSS/RFI documentation (and in particular to the SOO), the Air Force has decided that all contractors that have previously responded to this SSS/RFI must provide a new response.</p>
<p>Contractors that have not responded to this SSS/RFI in the past are encouraged to answer the RFI questions and submit a capabilities package.</p>
<p>Submit responses by mail to ATTN: Casey Wiseman, AFNWC/PKMA, 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, Rm 25, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5816.

<DESC>____________________________________________<br><br>14 March 2011<br><br>Amendment 0001 has been released and is available on the UIPE I1 website: https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html<br><br>Offerors must sign Amendment 0001 and include a signed copy as part of their proposal.<br>____________________________________________<br><br>28 February 2011<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: The UIPE I1 Request for Proposals has been posted, and is available on the UIPE I1 website: https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html<br><br>Please see below for details.<br><br>____________________________________________<br><br><br>The U. S. Army Contracting Command-APG(SCRT), Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager- Protection, has a requirement for a Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE I1). The UIPE I1 will be a single supplemental system that will provide enhanced individual protective capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of psychological, physiological and heat stress associated with garment thermal burden, weight and bulk. It is not intended to replace currently fielded CB garments but will provide an alternative lightweight capability for selected missions. The UIPE I1 will provide protection from CB warfare agents to include retaining protection after exposure to Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) and other environmental contaminants. The garment will be suitable for wear while performing combat operations, whether on land or at sea, in any climate, with minimal impact on combat effectiveness. It will be designed to permit efficient communications and be compatible with current and developmental protective component systems. It will also be compatible with current and developmental clothing and equipment including load-bearing equipment, helmets (i.e., cranial protection), handwear, footwear, body cooling systems, and protective masks of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the US Navy (USN). Complete UIPE I1 performance requirements will be delineated in a detailed System Performance Specification (SPS).<br><br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a UIPE I1 that will reduce thermal and physiological burden and reduce weight and bulk, over current Chemical-Biological (CB) protective garments. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the UIPE I1 by basing the design on a modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) product is central to the acquisition strategy.<br><br>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type in which Delivery Orders may be issued for a one year base period and four, one year option periods. The Government envisions delivery orders which shall be Firm-Fixed-Price contracts. The guaranteed minimum value for each contract awarded will be $50,000.00, and the cumulative total of all Delivery Orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $129,000,000.00 over the life of the contract.<br><br>The Government envisions that multiple awards will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or a single successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. <br><br>A small business goal of 30% is in effect and proposals shall address the small business plan. NAICS Code 315211 - Mens and Boys Cut and Sew Apparel Contractors applies with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.<br><br>Berry Amendment, DFARS 252.225-7012, applies to the resultant contract. Please note that items procured under this solicitation are considered chemical warfare protective clothing, and therefore the exemption described at Paragraph (c)(5) of the clause applies.<br><br>Contract award resulting from this solicitation is subject to availability of funds. Proposals shall be valid for at least 240 days. Please annotate the last day the proposal will be valid. Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with their proposal preparation.<br><br>The Request for Proposal will be posted on the Natick Contracting Center website- https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html, on Monday, 28 February 2011. Proposals will be due on Thursday, 31 March 2011.<br><br>All questions should be directed to john.conlin3@us.army.mil not later 4:00 PM EST, 14 calendar days after the date of release of this Solicitation. <br>

<DESC>GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION - AG-02RC-S-11-0039<br />No longer HubZone Setaside.&nbsp; Contract ceiling is at or below Simplified Acquisition Threshold thus eliminating HubZone requirment per FAR 19.1305.<br /><br />Idaho Panhandle National Forest NORTH ZONE Road Blading &amp; Minor Road Mtnc.<br />Sandpoint, Bonners Ferry &amp; Priest Lake Ranger Districts only.
<p>Work consists primarily of road blading and some minor road maintenance such as ditch cleaning, culvert cleaning &amp; reconditioning, rock and minor slide removal.</p>
<p>This will be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantities contract. The Government intends to target at least two and up to three awards. Task Orders will be subject to a Fair Opportunity given to each awardee except when exceptions to Fair Opportunity occur.</p>
<p>Pricing will be by the mile for common road grading in quantity groups and will not include mobilization. Mobilization pricing will be handled on a task order by task order basis. Pricing for items on the schedule of items will reflect the maximum price per mile for that quantity group. When task orders are competed, as required by the FAR 16.505 - which is called Fair Opportunity -</p>
<p>(b) Orders under multiple award contracts- <br />(1) Fair opportunity. <br />(i) The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,000 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts or multiple task-order contracts, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section...</p>
<p>Task Orders will be subject to Fair Opportunity among the main contract's awardees (two to three) for work ordered under this contract. Task Announcements will include specific descriptions and maps for the work to be accomplished, a Schedule of Items, an estimated start date and a contract time. Task Announcements sent to each contractor on this award will serve as "mini" solicitations with a foreshortened response time and stated deadline to start work.</p>
<p>Contractor's may discount, that is lower their initial item unit prices they quoted on the main contract when competing for task order awards. Therefore, initial unit pricing for the main contract should consider this. Not too high as to be unreasonable for the main award and not too low to allow little room for discounting when competing. Mobilization&nbsp;will be&nbsp;priced on a task order basis and therefore part of the&nbsp;competitive price on each task order.<br /><br />Example Quantity Groups:</p>
<p>Road Blading price per mile if less than 20 miles on a task order. <br />Road blading priced per mile if greater than 20 miles and less than 45 miles on a task order. <br />Road grading priced per mile if over 45 miles on a task order.</p>
<p>Some limited hourly work with equipment and operator will be on the schedule of items also to be utilized per the Time Material and Labor Hour Clauses FAR 52.212-4 Alternate One.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that other minor road maintenance work may be specified and priced on a per job basis within a task order for blading. These items will be called Over and Above Items and will not be priced on the main contract but any use of the Over and Above Items cannot exceed the price of road blading on any task order. And example may be "clean 7 culverts on the XX road." Or "blade the roads in XYZ campground."</p>
<p><br />The estimated start work date on-the-ground for the project is mid May of 2011.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT LOCATION: Idaho Panhandle NF: Sandpoint RD, Bonners Ferry RD and Priest Lake RD - together referred to as the North Zone.</p>
<p><br />SOLICITATION INFORMATION: <br />The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website on or about March 21, 2011 for viewing and printing. Since the solicitation will be under FAR part 12 Commercial Item procedures, a full fifteen day synopsis/pre-solicitation notice is not required so a shorter period will be utilized for the notice (FAR 5.203(a)(1))</p>
<p>Potential responders are requested to obtain the solicitation, including any plans/drawings from the Internet FBO site. NO HARD-COPY solicitations will be issued.</p>
<p>Quotes will be due approximately 29 calendar days after the solicitation issue date - Check the solicitation form to confirm the actual closing date subject to any amendments that may extend the solicitation. Target date for solicitation closing as of this notice is April 18, 2011.</p>

<DESC>SOUTH ZONE of Idaho Panhandle NF - St. Joe Ranger District.<br /><br />GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION - AG-02RC-S-11-0041<br />This is no longer a HubZone set-aside.&nbsp; Contract ceiling price is below the Simplified Acquisition Theshold per FAR 19.1305.<br /><br />Idaho Panhandle National Forest SOUTH ZONE Road Blading &amp; Minor Road Mtnc.<br />St. Joe Ranger District only.
<p>Work consists primarily of road blading and some minor road maintenance such as ditch cleaning, culvert cleaning &amp; reconditioning, rock and minor slide removal.</p>
<p>This will be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantities contract. The Government intends to target at least two and up to three awards. Task Orders will be subject to a Fair Opportunity given to each awardee except when exceptions to Fair Opportunity occur.</p>
<p>Pricing will be by the mile for common road grading in quantity groups and will not include mobilization. Mobilization pricing will be handled on a task order by task order basis. Pricing for items on the schedule of items will reflect the maximum price per mile for that quantity group. When task orders are competed, as required by the FAR 16.505 - which is called Fair Opportunity -</p>
<p>(b) Orders under multiple award contracts- <br />(1) Fair opportunity. <br />(i) The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,000 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts or multiple task-order contracts, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section...</p>
<p>Task Orders will be subject to Fair Opportunity among the main contract's awardees (two to three) for work ordered under this contract. Task Announcements will include specific descriptions and maps for the work to be accomplished, a Schedule of Items, an estimated start date and a contract time. Task Announcements sent to each contractor on this award will serve as "mini" solicitations with a foreshortened response time and stated deadline to start work.</p>
<p>Contractor's may discount, that is lower their initial item unit prices they quoted on the main contract when competing for task order awards. Therefore, initial unit pricing for the main contract should consider this. Not too high as to be unreasonable for the main award and not too low to allow little room for discounting when competing. Mobilization will be priced on a task order basis and therefore part of the competitive price on each task order.</p>
<p>Example Quantity Groups:</p>
<p>Road Blading price per mile if less than 20 miles on a task order. <br />Road blading priced per mile if greater than 20 miles and less than 45 miles on a task order. <br />Road grading priced per mile if over 45 miles on a task order.</p>
<p>Some limited hourly work with equipment and operator will be on the schedule of items also to be utilized per the Time Material and Labor Hour Clauses FAR 52.212-4 Alternate One.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that other minor road maintenance work may be specified and priced on a per job basis within a task order for blading. These items will be called Over and Above Items and will not be priced on the main contract but any use of the Over and Above Items cannot exceed the price of road blading on any task order. And example may be "clean 7 culverts on the XX road." Or "blade the roads in XYZ campground."</p>
<p><br />The estimated start work date on-the-ground for the project is mid May of 2011.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT LOCATION: Idaho Panhandle NF: St. Joe Ranger District- referred to as the South Zone.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is issued to give the intended scope of the Test Execution Services and Launch Augmentation (TESLA) Acquisition since many requested difference in TESLA and D3I at the D3I Industry Day.<br><br>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT)Test Execution Services and Launch Augmentation (TESLA) acquisition  is planned as a competitive bridge between our current Lethality Testing and Criteria Development contract and the planned Design, Development, <br>Demonstration and Integration (D3I) acquisition.  Services to be acquired under TESLA will satisfy near term testing objectives (to include program requirements, component development, procurement, conceptual design, analysis, fabrication, integration, demonstration and execution), as well as flight test support.  TESLA is <br>designed to avoid any disruption of services pending the award of D3I.  The term of TESLA will be 24 months, and will include two 12-month options periods, providing a graceful transition to D3I.  <br><br><br>The following is a tentative schedule for TESLA.  This schedule does not include all of the SMDC/ARSTRAT internal reviews.  Every effort will be made to accelerate this schedule.<br><br><br>             	<br>       Release RFI					01/12/2011	<br>       Finalize Contract Requirements			04/15/2011<br>       Issue Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP)		06/10/2010<br>       Pre-Proposal Conference				07/01/2010<br>       Issue Final RFP					08/01/2011<br>       Receive Proposals	  			09/20/2011<br>       Draft Contract Documents				12/05/2011<br>       Award						12/30/2011	<br>       <br>       			<br>No individual meetings are planned with the contractors at this time.<br>We are in the gathering phase of market research.

<DESC>The goal of the Transformative Apps program is to place the right mobile software applications ("apps") into the hands of warfighters as the apps are needed. As a result of this program, a diverse array of apps of national security relevance will be realized using an innovative new development and acquisition process. A military apps marketplace will be created to enable rapid innovation to meet user needs based on a direct collaboration between a vibrant and highly competitive development community and involved communities of end-users. The program will address all the challenges - technical, business, and operational - faced to make the new capabilities available for use in the field. The end objective is to transition the resulting systems to the end users in the Services, and to foster a new model for rapidly and effectively acquiring, introducing, maintaining, and enhancing software.
