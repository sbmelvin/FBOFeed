<DESC>Military Sealift Command (MSC) successfully converted some of its non-bargaining unit status employees to the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) on October 28, 2007.  While a significant percentage of MSCs workforce has already converted to NSPS, the remaining non-bargaining unit status employees at MSCHQ, approximately 230 employees, are scheduled to convert on 29 March 2009.  

The NSPS Program Manager (PM) and Team were responsible for ensuring all pre-conversion tasks were completed expeditiously and accurately.   Proper execution and implementation ensured greater understanding and acceptance by employees of a system that strives to change an organizations culture and values.  The shift from a pay system where entitlements are based on longevity to one where employees are compensated based on their performance and contribution to mission, requires a change in workplace behaviors. The NSPS PM and Team created and fostered increased communication, a culture of engagement, upward feedback and coaching for high performance.  Gaining employee confidence and trust in the new pay for performance system was arguably the most critical and challenging component of implementation.

Post-conversion review of NSPS activities and an evaluation of the mock pay pool exercise highlighted the importance of pre-implementation training, communication and senior leaders involvement.  The NSPS PM and Team will have to design a comprehensive pre- and post-conversion plan and execute all outlined tasks effectively and efficiently.  

The NSPS PM and Team will also focus on assessing and evaluating the MSC NSPS program, implementing process improvements where indicated, and provide sustainment training for those employees that have already converted.  Analysis of the recently completed pay pool process, development of updated MSC NSPS policies to reflect changes in the DoD NSPS enabling regulations, and focused refresher training will be completed to ensure that the MSC NSPS program implementation is a continued success.

The purpose of this requirement is to attain contractor support and expertise that will help MSC to manage the newly implemented NSPS program.

The solicitation resulting from this notice will be available on or about 07 January 2009.  Once the solicitation has been posted, it will be available at www.msc.navy.mil.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution, water distribution, and wastewater collection systems for the Tennessee Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at McGhee-Tyson Airport, to the City of Alcoa.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. The City of Alcoa (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The systems being privatized are described as follows: The McGhee-Tyson ANGB is located on McGhee-Tyson Airport in Alcoa, Tennessee and is approximately 13 miles south of Knoxville, Tennessee.  The installation consists of 358 acres.  An adjacent twelve-acre parcel is also included in this privatization effort.  The base is located on the northwest side of the airport with a total of 39 buildings: 22 industrial, 10 administrative, 3 dormitories, and 4 service buildings; totaling 651,000 square feet.  Day-to-day activities are managed by a force of approximately 800 full-time personnel.  Two weekends per month the population increases to 1700 during military training assemblies.  Electric power enters the base at two locations, one providing power to McGhee-Tyson ANGB and the other serving two units immediately adjacent to the base; Alcoa Air National Guard Station and the Tennessee Army National Guard facility.  Electric service is provided at 13.2 kV and distributed primarily underground via a Y configured system.  The system consists of approximately 22,300 linear feet of underground wiring in conduit and buried approximately four to six feet deep.  There is also approximately 1,160 linear feet of overhead wiring.  The system contains 43 three phase pad mounted transformers ranging from 75 to 1000 kVA; along with three single phase pad mounted transformers ranging from 25 to 75 kVA; 9 wooden utility poles 40 feet tall; 32 secondary meters, and 46 pre-cast concrete manholes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Glass break detection was chosen because of this building being a 24/7 site and alarm system armed for after hours, preventing false alarms. If it is determined that motion detection can be used in place of some glass breaks, then a dual tech type unit may be used (C&K DT660STC or equal/equivalent).  


2-1.5 A count of fifty-two (52) windows were identified, if additional windows are identified during the pre-bid walk-off, then security contractor to address. If windows are functional, due to the climate environment, open and close, both top and bottom then these windows need to be protected, such as window contacts (Sentrol #1032 or equal/equivalent), top and bottom, this will be determined during the pre-bid inspection. A second window magnet (Sentrol #1937 or equal/equivalent) may be requested so that this window can be opened and keeping the alarm system armed. A specialty alarm contact (GRI # VS-06 or equal/equivalent) may be requested, this would allow window venting of four to six inches before breaking contact and creating an alarm, this would be the preferred method, being that the alarm system would not have to be armed / disarmed could open and close the window with the alarm system armed. If this specialty contact is selected the security contractor will be required to install stop blocks to prevent the window from opening beyond the six inch range and prevent someone from attempting to enter through the window opening. 


2-1.6 Three (3) door (alarm contact) and electronic access locations will need to be interfaced for delay shunting of the alarm contact during after hour use, this will prevent false alarms. Security contactor to provide and install a standalone (door) pin keypad (IEI 212ILW or equal/equivalent) with a fail secure electric strike (Von Duprin 6000 series or equal/equivalent) to provide this delay shunt when entering the building. Tamper screws/hardware to be used to prevent tamping of the keypad. For delay shunting when exiting, install a request to exit PIR motion detector (Bosh #DS-DS150i equal/equivalent). Locations as follow:

1. First floor rear employee double entrance door.

2. First floor rear secondary single door. 

3. Basement level rear employee double entrance door.



Note: For electric strike locations it shall be the responsibility of the security contractor to provide an assured fit of the electric strike and door hardware to provide no possible means of defeating the security and integrity of the door. Security contractor may determine that a type of protective cover or pick plate designed for electric strikes may be required to prevent tamping of the electric strike. If the security contractor determines that each door will require protection for the electric strike then the security contractor shall be responsible to supply and install one. 


4-1 Vendor shall provide a detailed line item unit price sheet for all equipment and related items pertaining to the installation required on this project. Contractor to submit a detailed break down of each unit, price per item and an hourly rate for installation of that unit, for cable/wire contractor to price per one-hundred feet.

For the last several years, the Department of Defense (DoD) has been engaged in a broad effort to transform its business operations while supporting 21st Century national security require-ments.  The Business Transformation Agency (BTA) was established as a DoD Agency whose mission is to guide the transformation of business operations throughout DoD and deliver enterprise-level capabilities that align to war-fighter needs and support national security requirements.  Information about the BTA may be found at http://www.defenselink.mil/bta/.   Additionally, an Enterprise-level framework was established with six Business Enterprise Priorities (BEP) targeted to improve business capabilities across personnel, logistics, real property, acquisition, purchasing and financial capabilities.  Information on the BEPs and enterprise programs can be found in the 2007 Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) located at  http://www.defenselink.mil/dbt/products/2007_BEA_ETP/etp/ETP.html.  <BR><BR>3.  Objectives:  In accordance with FAR 15.201 - Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals, this is a Statement of Objectives (SOO) and not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  BTA needs to standardize and streamline operational and sustainment capabilities of the BTA enterprise.  This SOO is intended to provide information about the BTAs requirements for hosting services to support BTA programs.   <BR><BR>4.  Scope:  The scope of this SOO includes a full range of hosting services necessary for the BTA to sat-isfy its support mission with respect to improving business capabilities across the range of personnel, lo-gistics, real property, acquisition, purchasing and financial capabilities.  The BTA is also interested in un-derstanding any additional capabilities that are industry developed and available as commercial best prac-tice.<BR><BR>The BTA is an integrated business transformation enterprise within the Department of Defense. This pro-vides a challenge to manage multiple independent collaborative programs and projects within an emerging enterprise infrastructure and application topology. Both application space and infrastructure constantly evolve and mature to meet business demands. Services of interest to BTA include:<BR><BR>"	Enterprise integrated management services with the ability to administer programs and projects independently or collectively as determined to be most optimal by BTA management considera-tion. The hosting provider should have the capability to describe effective and value driven solu-tions across the entire BTA portfolio.<BR>"	Configurable reporting tools that include: cost, performance, issue tracking, capacity and infra-structure utilization, operations statistics, risk management indicators and other information that provides insight for effective decision making.<BR><BR>Customer support capability using a portfolio integrated Support Center..  Support  Center re-sources should include multiple levels for problem escalation and resolution for system users (op-erations, administrative, management and end-user), as well as formal Trouble ticket tracking and reporting metrics.

<SUBJECT>19--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY Design and Construction Best Practices, Analysis and Recommendations for future submarine launched, diver lockout long duration combat submersibles.
<SOLNBR>N0002409N6213
<RESPDATE>022009

<CONTACT>CAPT Gard Clark(202)781-1509

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, this is a request for information. This RFI is being conducted to determine if there is industry interest to produce combat submersible vehicles as described should the Government decide to procure such vehicles.  The decision to procure said vehicles has not yet been made, but this RFI would help inform programmatic questions inherent in that decision.  This RFI is for fact finding only and does not constitute a commitment or obligation by the Government to issue an RFP, contract or order.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor would the Government return any data provided.
A future combat submersible should provide theater Special Operation Forces (SOF) commanders the operational capability to conduct insertion and extraction of SOF personnel and/or payloads into and from denied areas from strategic distances.  These submersibles would mate to a host submarine using the same interface as that of ASDS-1.  The submersibles should be able to conduct clandestine surveillance during extended loiter times at close-in distances.  A modular capability and capacity to hold varying payload would enhance its utility for a broad range of missions including intelligence collection, surveillance, and reconnaissance in support of SOF objectives.  An Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of FY 2016 is desired for the first of three potential submersible units.
BACKGROUND: The Advanced Seal Delivery System (ASDS), a first generation submarine launched, diver lockout, long duration combat submersible for SOF, was developed and completed final acceptance by the Government in CY 2003.  However, in CY 2006, the Department of Defense (DoD) cancelled the ASDS program due to operational reliability and cost issues.  A comprehensive and combined Government and Industry series of Critical System Reviews was undertaken, leading to development of design changes to improve reliability.  The fabrication, installation, and testing of these modifications are in progress.  In CY 2008, a DoD directed analysis of alternate material solutions to the ASDS program was conducted and concluded that a dry submersible launched from a host support submarine was the preferred alternative to fulfill the required mission.  Should the Navy go forward with a program, it would require an expeditious and low technological risk approach to filling this mission need! .  It is anticipated that if the Government decides to enter into a procurement that up to 3 systems may be initially procured.
APPROACH:  In order to minimize technical risk and expeditiously deliver the capability to the fleet in a cost effective manner, the designer would be expected to leverage appropriate portions of the ASDS-1 design in developing the detailed design.  The effort should take into account ASDS-1 lessons learned including operational history, investigations and results of the Critical Systems Reviews, and other available information on the ASDS program specifically to include Government Furnished Information.  One criterion for risk evaluation of potential designs would be the designer's approach to re-use of successful design elements and details from ASDS-1 as well as recommendation of appropriate and necessary changes to achieve specified reliability requirements including material availability, mean time between failure and mean time to repair.  The design is also expected to accommodate appropriate changes to facilitate cost-effective manufacture at the construction facility!  and would be expected to include changes for producibility (including potential weight reduction) and changes to account for obsolescence and/or diminished manufacturing sources.  It would be the responsibility of the designer to propose the balance of reuse and new development in the vehicle.  However, new design elements must be shown to have high technical readiness levels and minimum risk in integration with the remaining vehicle systems.  A total design effort of less than 2 years would be anticipated.
The Government expects the design drawings necessary to build the combat submersible vehicle can be completed in approximately 9 months and that a full Critical Design Review would be conducted by the Government prior to authorizing commencement of first unit construction.
The Government expects that the following potential items would be GFE:a)	Propulsorb)	Forward Looking Sonarc)	Hatches (unless bidder's proposal shows that CFE would be more economical)d)	External communications equipment and cryptographic equipment (excluding antenna system)
The Government is evaluating the following acquisition strategy, timeline, and schedule:
A full and open competition would result in award of a fixed priced multi-phased Preliminary Design-Detailed Design-Build Contract to multiple offerors.  These contracts would establish a firm fixed price preliminary design period followed by options to conduct detailed design and further individual options for the purchase of long lead time material and then actual construction for each vehicle.  Contract award would be based on consideration of the proposal for the entire design-build effort, not only the preliminary design period.  Contracts would be awarded to capable and experienced designers and builders whose proposals offer best value and demonstrates low risk solutions that can comply with the required technical requirements.  The design and construction specification would work to minimize program risk by encouraging reuse of reliable portions of the ASDS design including previous improvements and by making other appropriate reliability upgrades, producibility, aco! ustic, diminished manufacturing supply and obsolescence modifications.  The offerors would propose the balance between reuse of ASDS design including its current improvements and new design.  Exceptions to proposed new design elements are no changes will be allowed from the ASDS-1 Host Interface and the proposed hull design must not warrant the conduct of a new hull confirmation model or strain-gaging of the lead hull.  Additionally, the following GFE items would have essentially the same interface and performance capabilities as those currently installed in ASDS-1: SOF Communications Gear, the propulsor, and Forward Look Sonar.  The vehicle hatches shall be consistent with the 25 and 30 inch hatches used in ASDS-1 although updated design versions such as the Virginia Class bridge access trunk hatch may be proposed and the source is negotiable.   Following review of the preliminary design information, it is intended to award options to only one of the initial contractors th! at produced preliminary designs.  The detailed design, long lead time material and construction options on the contract would be established as fixed price options with incentives possible for cost and or schedule as appropriate to the individual option.
In the first contract year, award of multi-phased contracts would begin with a 3-Month preliminary design effort followed by approximately 2 months of evaluation at a not to exceed price.  The output of the preliminary design phase would also include preliminary design approaches to the contractor's perceived highest risk areas.  At the conclusion of the preliminary design phase, offerors would provide a Best and Final Offer (BAFO) including performance, technical features, cost, and schedule compared to the original bid and negotiated values and conditions.  Increased costs would not be accepted and a down-selection to a single designer and builder would be made based on the BAFO using the same source selection criteria used to award the contract but would also include analysis of products delivered as part of the preliminary design phase.  The option for the design effort starting in the second contract year would then be exercised using the BAFO pricing and the detailed d! esign effort would commence.  The contract priced options would also be adjusted based on the BAFO.  The option for the purchase of Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) in the third contract year may be exercised upon Government approval of the design drawings and details.  The fixed priced option for construction of System #1 may be exercised in the fourth contract year.  Similarly the fixed priced options for LLTM and Construction for System #2 may be exercised approximately one year later.  System delivery would be required NLT 36 months after contract.  Options might also exist for a third system.
A performance based specification for designing and building the system is being prepared to require adherence to appropriate specified design and construction standards where applicable, established quality control program, submission of design drawings and design data for government submission as well as the conduct of factory floor, and at sea testing culminating in a combined acceptance trials.  The specification for designing and building is under development and if the Government decides to enter into a procurement, it is expected to be released for review and comment as part of a draft RFP that may be issued as early as CY 2009.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: These unclassified system key performance parameter areas are applicable: A) Combat Range, B) Endurance, C) Passengers, D) Lock-In/Out Operations, E) Cruise Speed, F) Vehicle Signature, G) Interoperability/Net Ready Capability, H) Operational/Material Availability, I) Force Protection, and J) Survivability.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs seeks comments and identification of sources for the Veterans Information Technology Architecture and Long-term Solution (VITALS).  The draft statement of objectives and instructions to offerors are for use in soliciting comments only.  The Government does not seek nor will it accept offers to perform work in conjunction with this request.  Unsolicited offers will be rejected.  The statement of objectives and instructions to offers is provided to solicit comments and suggestions on how the Government might improve these documents.  Specifically, the Government seeks industry input as to whether or not enough information is provided for offerors  to respond with a proposal to an RFP.  The Government also seeks suggestions from industry in formulation of evaluation criteria.  The VITALS contract and use of a statement of objectives for mission critical IT systems is a significant departure from previous contracting actions.  The Government is requesting support from  industry  to identify meaningful discriminators,  by which the Government can base an evaluation and award.The Government will sponsor  an Industry Day to present the VITALS initiative.  This will be held at the International Trade Center in the Ronald Regan Building in Washington, DC on January 30 from 8:00 - noon (Tentative).  The Government will make a formal presentation of its approach, goals, and concepts for the VITALS contract and will the take questions.  The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Center for Veterans Enterprise have placed the highest priority on maximizing involvement of service disabled veteran owned businesses and veteran owned business at all levels on contracts awarded by VA. An area will also be provided both during and immediately after Industry Day for vendor networking to encourage identification and partnering between all levels of business with veteran owned businesses desiring to compete for the VITALS contract.  Participation in Industry Day will be restricted to three participants from a single company.  Companies must pre-register with VA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization by contacting Mark Taylor at 202-461-4258.The Government references a Reading Room which has not yet been established.  The Government hopes to have this room established and open before Industry Day. Comments in response to this RFI and Sources Sought should be sent to Wayne Miller, Contracting officer,  Wayne.Miller6@va.gov  VITALS STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVESScope:This contract will identify and obtain a partner that will augment and support VA by providing a broad range of IT expertise, services and systems to enable VA to better serve veterans.  Through this partnership, an IT environment will be implemented across the enterprise that will provide IT capabilities to meet specific requirements for support and operation of user level product identified, implemented, developed and acquired by VA.  This includes architecting strategies and solutions for incorporation of new and legacy IT functionalities into this new environment.  This contract will provide architecting and integration services for migration, implementation, and operation of IT systems across VA.  It will provide support and maintenance and/or maintenance coordination for all solutions architected and/or implemented under this contract. Initial emphasis of this contract will be the establishment of a new environment to replace the legacy VistA servers operating on obsolete HP Alpha computers.Reading RoomThis contract represents a departure from previous contracting strategies for provision of IT hardware and support of mission critical IT systems.  For the initial task to be proposed through this competition, the incumbent contractor is Hewlett-Packard, Corp (HP).  HP (previously Compaq Corp and Digital Equipment Corp) has been providing the systems and services called for in the initial task for over 25 years.   In an effort to level the competitive field, the Government has provided a reading room with a large number of documents that are intended to be used as reference materials to assist offerors in understanding the current VA environment.  Not all documents in the Reading Room will apply to this acquisition and are intended to provide offerors a better understanding of VA.  VA has gone to great lengths to provide these documents to provide offerors with a broader understanding of VA, our IT history, as well as previous thinking and work performed in the IT arena.  They are not intended to augment information provided in this solicitation unless specifically identified in the RFP.  VA will not take questions about the documents provided through the Reading Room unless the document is specifically referenced herein.  VA has spent a great deal of time in reviewing the documents posted in that reading room in an effort to provide only relevant and accurate information about VA.  Despite these efforts, VA acknowledges these documents are not complete and may not be completely accurate in terms of VA's current direction, implementation, approach and operation.  Documents in that room that are found to be contradictory may indicate changes in VA approach over the past.  Further, any document in the Reading Room that contradicts what is included in this solicitation should be disregarded.  Offerors are cautioned to not make assumptions based on information found in those documents unless they are specifically referenced herein. The only information the offeror should consider to be completely accurate is the information provided or referenced in the RFP.  Do not include references to documents provided in the Reading Room as part of your proposal unless they are specifically referenced within this RFP. Background:Current Environment:Definitions:Environment - This is the integrated set of Platforms, Systems, and Components that provide computing infrastructure for Products.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Management Services Division (MSD), Center for Contracting, Facilities & Administrative Services (CCFAS), Contracting Group intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Dr. Brigitte Schay, 8340 Greensboro Drive, #720, McLean VA 22102-3545 for transition management and knowledge management consulting services.

The objective of the current procurement is to secure transition management and knowledge management consulting services, as well as technical support on several longitudinal projects that require specialized program evaluation expertise. Specific support is needed on the first evaluation report for a pay-for-performance demonstration project with the Food and Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) of USDA, and the final evaluation of the CTS Pilot Incentive Program.  Both of these projects require a level of specialized program evaluation expertise that is currently not available in the branch or other parts of CTS. 

Assistance is needed in knowledge transfer concerning the highly specialized products and services provided by the Assessment Services Branch (survey research involving customer service, culture and climate, and evaluation of pay-for-performance demonstration projects), as well as transition management assistance involving internal financial management processes and human resources management.  This technical support and transition management assistance are needed for a period of approximately six months (i.e., January through June, 2009) and will require 500 hours. The technical assistance to the branch is critical to the successful completion of the work for ASBs Federal clients and for a smooth transition to a new branch manager who has to phase out of long-term projects currently being managed in the Competency Assessment Branch.  

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via e-mail to John R. Dismond at john.dismond@opm.gov within 2 days of the published date of this notice.  Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. All OPM contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to execution of award.  If no competitive responses are received, an award will be made to Dr. Brigitte Schay.

<DESC><p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (GPTC), for the purchase of Preventative and Remedial Maintenance of NOAA National Weather Radio (NWR) All Hazards System transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at four (4) GPTC owned and operated sites located in Georgia in Atlanta, Chatsworth, Pelham and Waycross. The maintenance shall ensure the quality of NWR broadcasts and the issuance of warnings to the listening public within the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA) specifications and Department of Homeland Security requirements for each station. The National Weather Service (NWS) is mandated by the Federal Response Plan to provide uninterrupted Emergency Alert System (EAS) broadcast transmissions 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission's unique ability to provide maintenance of NWR transmitter systems on a 24-hour, 7 day-a-week basis due to their unlimited access to the tower and transmitter equipment. This unlimited access is required in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. The GPTC towers have accessibility restrictions in regards to Homeland Security. Their FCC license for broadcast television systems mandates the sites remain secure and therefore GPTC does not allow other vendors unlimited access to them. Maintenance of NWR transmitter systems require 24-hour access to the tower and transmitter equipment in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. In addition, all GPTC maintenance personnel that perform routine and corrective maintenance on the NWR transmitter system have appropriate technical qualifications, training, and experience to perform the required work on the NWS high power radio frequency (RF) VHF FM transmitter systems. GPTC technical representatives are equipped with a full complement of NWR test equipment that is calibrated according to NWS specifications to assure accurateness in all NWR measurements. All maintenance personnel must meet NWS qualifications by appropriate schooling in electronics and associated theory, and specific training provided by the Government in the maintenance of its NWR transmitter equipment. No other sources appear to be technically capable of maintaining the NWR equipment at the subject Georgia sites. It must therefore be concluded that the only source capable of maintaining the NWR equipment is the GPTC.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract will be for a period of 60 months which includes a base year, and four (4) one-year option periods. Anticipated award date is no later than April 1, 2009. This requirement is a follow-on contract to RA133W04CN0004 with GPTC. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 811213 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>Background: In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA's NWR was designated the sole government operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. The mandate required uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year. Since 1978, the State of Georgia has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and GPTC. To satisfactorily perform this mandate in the state of Georgia, the NWS strategically located NWR transmitter stations at four Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (GPTC) sites at Atlanta, Chatsworth, Pelham and Waycross. The NWR Program remains a prime entry point in the Emergency Alert System (EAS) along with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The critical function of the NWR system is to activate the EAS. This is expected to continue indefinitely especially with the FEMA deployment of the ALL-Hazards Emergency Message Collection System (HazCollect). The HazCollect System will allow emergency management agencies and partners of the NWS to generate Non-Weather Emergency Messages (NWEMS) for automatic distribution through NWS Dissemination Systems. The NWR is also one of the NWS's primary means of disseminating weather forecasts and warnings.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe that they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation within 15 days after publication of this synopsis by emailing their capability statement to Contract Specialist Susan Labovitz at Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Acquisition and Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the University of Bristol located at Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS for Trace Gas Measurements in Barbados.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the University of Bristols' access to the specific specialized measuring instrumentation required under this contract, the technical expertise to continue the data linkage requirement and that no other contractor has indicated an interest in providing this service.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract will be for a period of 60 months which includes a base year, and four (4) one-year option periods. Anticipated award date is no later than March 22, 2009. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>This requirement is a follow-on contract to RA133003CN3025 with International Science Consultants. NOAA publicized this requirement on May 29, 2008 to determine if there were any other sources capable of providing highly accurate measurements. The University of Bristol located at Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, is the only known qualified and responsible source.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Barbados site is one of four stations comprising the current Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network beginning in the time frame of 1993-1996. This network originated from the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE) in 1978 and transformed to Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) with the addition of new instruments during the 1981-1985 time frame. These networks were established to monitor the long-term trends of several trace gas species that cause stratospheric ozone destruction. Aside from NOAA's Global Monitoring Division (GMD) program, there are no other such national organized networks; only one or two other sites operated by foreign governments. Data from the network are analyzed for long-term trends, changes in sources, and global budgets and published jointly by the AGAGE research team. The species are key compounds in the issues of stratospheric ozone depletion and "greenhouse" climate warming. Thus, there is a fundamental scientific need to monitor the atmospheric concentrations of these species, and document their long-term increase. To establish the long-term change with high precision, the measurements must be made with a frequency of at least several observations per day. There is a critical scientific requirement that the future measurements are directly linked to those of the past and to the other sites of the GAGE network. This requirement is completely inflexible and, without this link to the past, the future measurements would have minimal value.</p>
<p>The following measurements have been made at East Point, Barbados by contractors, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NOAA: beginning in 1978, measurements of the trace gas species CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), carbon tetrachloride (CC14,) methyl chloroform (CH3CC13), and nitrous oxide N2O. In 1985, methane (CH4) and CFC-113 (CClF2-CCl2F) were added. Chloroform (CHC13) was added in 1995.</p>
<p>GMD makes similar measurements at five additional sites and is, therefore, keenly interested in obtaining comparable data from Barbados. GMD has partially supported the Barbados measurements since 1984. The project will likely continue another 20 years or so, or as long as there is a threat of depletion of stratospheric ozone from the species being monitored.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The NOAA/GMD has a continuing need for a Contractor capable of furnishing the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services (except as otherwise specified) to perform the following functions:</p>
<p>a. Make measurements of the concentrations in ambient air of the species listed in Table 1 below.</p>
<p>b. Make these measurements of each species with the frequency of at least once every 40 minutes.</p>
<p>c. Make these measurements within 100 meters from the seacoast at East Point (also known as Ragged Point), Barbados (approx 130 10'N. lat., 590 25' W. long).</p>
<p>d. Make these measurements with an absolute accuracy (relative to past AGAGE measurements) of 0.5% for CH4 and 1% for all other species. Typical Northern Hemisphere (NH) concentrations and relative precisions are reported in Table 1. Researchers there should measure each individual type of trace gases listed at atmospheric levels near its concentration in the NH, and with the precisions listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>e. Make these measurements by gas chromatography technology using Contractor furnished Hewlett-Packard Model 6890 ECD gas chromatograph, or equivalent.</p>
<p>f. The Contactor shall house the instrument in a Contractor furnished air-controlled Windowless shelter.</p>
<p>g. The Contractor shall make these measurements to be directly comparable and linked to similar measurements made at the Barbados location since 1978 by the American Lifetime Experiment (ALE) and its successor, the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE). The ALK and GAGE programs are described in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 238, pp. 945-950, 1987.</p>
<p>h. The Contractor shall provide calibration standards interlinked with similar past measurements from ALE and similar contract-period measurements being made at other locations by the NASA-sponsored GAGE. Current GAGE standards are provided by Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p>i. The Contractor shall provide personnel to visit the shelter at least once per day, every day of the year, to confirm instrument operational status and note and record weather conditions.</p>
<p>j. The Contractor shall attend meetings of the GAGE project team (held every 6 months) to discuss linkage of Barbados and other GAGE measurements.</p>
<p>k. The Contractor shall provide technical personnel to visit the site at least once every 4 months to service and repair equipment and replace expendable parts.</p>

<p><br />Requirements:</p>
<p>Measurement Location and Infrastructure: The measurement location must be in a clean air sector and free from any local pollutants or contaminants.</p>
<p>Instrumentation must be reliable and have documented calibration and maintenance plan.</p>
<p>Every six months, a new time period of measured gas concentration data from the Barbarous site should be uploaded on the web for NOAA and other scientists to compare their measurements to the AGAGE data set. The timing should be right before the biannual AGAGE/NOAA meeting.</p>
<p>Data Reporting: A monthly report of gases measured must be submitted to:</p>
<p>NOAA / Global Monitoring Division<br />Attn: Observatory Operations<br />ESRL / GMD1<br />325 Broadway<br />Boulder, CO 80305</p>
<p>Data Linkage: The Barbados data must be directly comparable to the past historical record of measurements of these chemical species at that site and to the similar measurements at the four other AGAGE sites. The AGAGE team has achieved scientific acceptance and credibility for their data from many years of hard work with results and data freely available to the scientific community at large.</p>
<p>Measurements during the upcoming years must be directly comparable to those obtained since AGAGE began (partially supported by NOAA over the past fourteen years). This fundamental aspect of the project cannot be compromised. NOAA must be absolutely certain that detected atmospheric changes are real and not artifacts of instrumental or methodology changes.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe that they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation within 15 days after publication of this synopsis by emailing their capability statement to Contract Specialist Susan Labovitz at Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov.

In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits.

However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.

If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
		Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
		2100 Second Street, SW
		Washington, D.C. 20593
		Telephone (202)267-2285
		FAX:  (202)267-4011

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.	The Department of Veterans, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for a Spot Picker for use in the research department. This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is VA-241-09-RQ-0088. This requirement is not set aside since market research indicates there is not a reasonable expectation of receiving two (2) quotes.  The NAICS Code is 334516.All Quotes are due no later than 3pm EST on January 8, 2009.No telephone requests will be accepted.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may send their quote by e-mail to Tracey.Bissonnette-Arambula@va.gov.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the capability to comply with the below requirement.  Responses will be evaluated.  Inquires/information received after established deadline of January 8, 2009 3PM EST shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular November 14, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 221).I.

Yang  jp bla-116Jamaica Plain Campus150 South Huntington AvenueJamaica Plain, MA 02130POC: Maria Higgins (Tel:  857.364.4098)III. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT The Spot Picker with DeCyder will be used to upgrade our current Typhoon 8600 Image Scanner for 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis.  The requested instrument needs to be compatible with the Typhoon 8600 Image Scanner.The requested Spot Picker is a robotic system designed to accurately pick protein spots from 2-D gels, and transfer the picked proteins into microplate wells in preparation for further analyses, such as digestion and protein identification by MALDI mass spectrometry.  Polyacrylamide 2-D gels stained with common detection stains, such as silver, Coomassie or fluorescent dyes are scanned, and data can be analyzed using DeCyder 2-D Differential Analysis Software. A protein picklist is generated, either automatically using predefined selection criteria, or manually. The protein picklist is transferred to the Spot Picker, which then automatically picks the protein spots according to the list. Attaching self-adhesive reference markers to the gel backing prior to scanning the gel ensures a precise link between electronic image and actual gel.  A wash step is performed after each picking session, and the location of each picked protein in its respective microplate well is automatically logged to facilitate sample tracking. The requested Spot Picker needs to be extremely stable and have a high utility in areas where extensive proteomic analysis is being carried out. The entire process is completed rapidly, with minimal user intervention. The gel pieces that are obtained can be directly channeled to a mass spectrometer. The polyacrylamide pieces containing the protein of interest can be trypsinated in the same well and used for mass spectrometric analysis. IV.

To be eligible for promotion to this level, the PSC must receive at least an Excellent performance rating in the annual performance evaluation, and must meet the minimum qualifications requirements for the higher grade.  Once at the GS-10 level, the title of the position will change to Program Specialist.

The Contracting Officer will award a modification to formalize any change in position/statement of work and salary increase, as well as to provide any incremental funding required.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:
To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in this solicitation.  1)  The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  A score of Acceptable would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements.  An Unacceptable score means that the offer will not be considered for award.

PRICE:

The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance. 

(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2008).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

<p><span>
<p>QUESTION: Our company is interested in subject solicitation and want to know if Federal Excise Tax should be added to our price quote and if it is applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Although 26 U.S.C. Section 4181 imposes an excise tax on the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of "...shells and cartridges," 26 U.S.C. 4182 provides that "No ... shells and cartridges purchased with funds appropriated for the military department shall be subject to any tax imposed on the sale or transfer of such articles." Thus, it is our opinion that no excise tax is due. Please note that this is the opinion of our in-house legal counsel and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. In taking any position with respect to taxes, recommend that you consult your own tax counsel.</p>

5. MARKET VALUE: The entry grade level of this position will be the equivalent of a GS-7 or GS-9, with locality pay ($39,330 - $62,546 per year).  The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the daily pay range depending on qualifications, salary and work history, experience and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.  Candidates who live outside the Washington, D.C. area will be considered for employment but no relocation expenses will be reimbursed.  The highest level of this position is GS-10. However, USAID intends to fill this position at the entry level GS-7 or GS-9 level, not at the GS-10 level.

This position, for a Personal Services Contractor Administrative Program Assistant, has been designated as a ladder position, starting at the entry level GS-7 (salary range: $39,330 - $51,124 per year) or GS-9 (salary range: $48,108 - $62,546 per year), depending on the qualifications of the applicant.  If starting at the GS-7 salary range, the individual will work pursuant to the statement of work set forth in the contract for the established entry level position for a minimum period of 12 months.  After 12 months of performance, the PSC may be considered for promotion to the GS-9 level subject to completion of the annual performance evaluation by the CTO/supervisor.  To be eligible for promotion to this level, the PSC must receive at least an Excellent performance rating in the annual performance evaluation.  The employee must also meet the minimum qualifications requirements for the higher grade.  After 24 months of performance at the GS-9 level, the PSC may be considered for promotion to the GS-10 level subject to completion of the annual performance evaluation by the CTO/supervisor.  To be eligible for promotion to this level, the PSC must receive at least an Excellent performance rating in the annual performance evaluation, and must meet the minimum qualifications requirements for the higher grade.  Once at the GS-10 level, the title of the position will change to Program Specialist.   

The CTO/supervisor must provide a copy of the annual performance evaluation to the Contracting Officer before the end of each contract year, which will be included in the official award file.  The Contracting Officer will award a modification to formalize any change in position/statement of work and salary increase, as well as to provide any incremental funding required.

Applicants must clearly state on the OF-612 form which grade level they are applying for.  Applicants may submit applications for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each. Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position/grade level to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-9 position may not be accepted for a GS-7 position/grade level).  

6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  2 years, with three one-year option periods.  OTI reserves the right to offer a contract for a period of fewer than five years, where deemed appropriate.  There will be an initial probationary period of three months.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<a href="mailto:jonesk@us.army.mil">ACA, ITEC4</a>
<DESC>Question 1: Can you please give us list of the following systems to be covered under EFD, as per PWS?<BR>	A: Existing Funding Distribution System<BR>	B. Component ERP Systems<BR>Answer 1:  EFD is required to replace a series of stove-piped applications and manual funds distribution efforts currently operating (Release I).  EFD is required to  interface with current Military Department and Defense Agency funds distribution systems including but not limited to PBIS (Navy), AFM (Air Force), and PBAS (Defense Agencies and Army) in Releases I and II.  Finally EFD will eventually replace PBAS for Defense Agency use (Release III).<BR><BR>Question 2:  Please clarify release schedule dates as mentioned in Table 1 (EFD Releases) in item 11.1 of PWS. Dates mentioned in Table 1 dont match with the release schedule information provided in delivery matrix item 11.2. Please clarify.<BR>Answer 2:  The release schedule dates in Table I (EFD Releases) are consistent with the information provided in delivery matrix item.  Table I specifies 12 months for Release I.  Calendar Days after TO Start in delivery matrix item 11.2 specifies five PWS tasks scheduled to take 30 days each.  Since no other delivery schedule dates or time-lines are explicit in item 11.2 it is incorrect to say that item 11.2 and Table I do not match.  Item 11.2 is a delivery schedule matrix that outlines required tasks; it is not necessarily in sequential order.  Release I tasks are to be completed before Release II tasks, followed by tasks associated with Release III.<BR><BR>Question 3: In item 11.1 of PWS mention is made of Additional Releases. Are these Additional Releases over and above the Releases mentioned in Table 1 of item 11.1?<BR>Answer 3:  The Additional Releases mentioned in item 11.1 of the PWS are not over and above the Releases mentioned in Table 1 of item 11.1.<BR><BR>Question 4: Section 12 of the PWS states that all contractor support personnel are required to secure a valid DD For 254 as outlined within the Contract Security Classification Specification.  The DD Form 254 was not provided.  Is a security clearance required to work on this effort?  If yes, what level? Is U.S. Citizenship required to work on this effort?<BR>Answer 4: Backround checks are required.  Contractor personnel are required to secure a valid DD-Form 254.<BR><BR>Question 5: Demonstration scripts are incomplete.  When does the Government intend to provide completed scenario scripts, as this directly affects configuration, demonstration and response pricing.  There is no Fair and Open method to price an incomplete specification.<BR>Answer 5: We do not agree that the current demonstration scripts are incomplete.  The current scripts are complete and should be helpful to vendors if they are selected to demonstrate.  Vendors that offer the highest qualifying COTS solution may be selected to provide demonstrations; others will not.  Demonstrations may occur after vendors have been down- selected based on responses to the Requirements Matrix and the other requirements outlined in the PWS.  Vendors selected to demonstrate a COTS solution will be provided Government furnished Information (GFI) up to two weeks in advance of any scheduled demonstration.  <BR><BR>Question 6: Terms of Failure during demonstration are not defined, therefore, respondent has no fair gauge by which to judge adequacy of solution in response, or how to price solution configurations.  Does the Government intend to provide Fair and Clear Test Standards prior to submission deadline?<BR>Answer 6: Vendors down-selected for demonstration will be selected based on the technical features of the COTS solution and other specification outlined in the PWS.  Vendors selected for demonstration are not expected to fail any one of the scenarios outlined in the EFD End to End Scenario document.  These scenarios are chosen because they are standard, routine, and expected occurrences that DoD funds distribution systems handle.  Demonstrations provide the opportunity to show the relative ease in which these tasks are handled.<BR><BR>Question 7: Does the Government consider customization of an inherent system capability compliant as a mandatory function?<BR>Answer 7: The government is seeking to purchase a COTS solution for EFD.  Thus, any customization to a COTS solution potentially diminishes its efficiency.  However, customization, within a COTS solution (an inherent system capability), is compliant as a mandatory function.  Customization costs are to be reflected in the Vendor cost proposal.<BR><BR>Question 8: How many total users are anticipated by the Government across all phases?<BR>Answer 8: to RFP questions released on 12/23 indicate vastly different ranges according to which question was being answered.  It is critical the Government provide End User, Administrator and Super User quantities by phase/date in order to facilitate fair licensing quotations and best value for the Government.<BR><BR>End User, Administrator and Super User quantities by phase/date Estimates:<BR>				Phase I		Phase II/II<BR><BR>End-Users			50-100		100-500<BR>Administrator/ Super User	5-10		10-25<BR><BR>Question 9: What is the estimated throughput, in number of documents, during peak processing?<BR>Answer 9: Estimated throughput, during peak processing (in number of documents)<BR><BR>				Phase I		Phase II/II<BR><BR>Documents			150-200	500-1,000<BR><BR>Question 10a: Will the Government provide server hardware for the solution, or is the offeror required to deliver the required hardware? The HCI fully hosted solution pricing varies significantly based on use of Government Provided Servers, or the more economical/better value and scalable hosted environment for this solution.<BR>Answer 10a: The Government will provide server hardware for the solution.<BR>Question 10b. Is a fully managed/hosted environment, its inherent added value and reduced TCO of interest to the government for this solution?<BR>Answer 10b: The Government is not interested in a fully managed/hosted environment for this solution.<BR><BR>Question 11: The Government has not defined any terminology within the mandatory capability matrix. Respondents are left to suppose proper responses for each requirement.  Does the Government intend to publish a Fair Standard Set of Instructions for completion of the solution matrix?<BR>Answer 11:  The Government uses common financial management terminology within the mandatory capability matrix. Your specific questions on terminology and phrasing are addressed in question 8 below. The Government does not intend to publish additional instructions for completion of the solution matrix.  <BR><BR>Question 12: Configuration requirements in the SOW, RFP and Demonstration Scenarios are not clearly defined.  Does the Government intend to publish a Fair and Complete Set of Systems requirements prior to RFP submission due date.  Examples of incomplete configuration data:<BR>Question 12a: IE Are configuration items expected to be directly input into a productive systems or will these items go through regular SLDC stages of DEV/QA/Test? <BR>Answer 12a:  Since the government is looking for a COTS solution configuration items are expected to be directly input into a productive systems.<BR>Question 12b: Is the term configuration referring to production data that provides foundational information that is utilized by the transactional flow and is relatively stable but is still client operational data and not traditional configuration data?<BR>Answer 12b:  Yes.  The term configuration is referring to production data that provides foundational information that is utilized by the transactional flow and is relatively stable but is still client operational data.  <BR>Question 12c: Configurability  Can business rules be administered in the solution without making changes to the application code. This is dependent on the business rules in question and what is considered application code<BR>Answer 12c: The desirable COTS solution would be flexible enough to handle generic business rules without customizing the COTS product to be purchased by the government.<BR>Question 12d: Usability  Can administration of functional data (e.g., Reprogramming thresholds, work flows, appropriations, etc.) be delegated to functional analyst verse technical personnel. As I classify functional analyst this would be one of their main functions within the system but clarity in definitions is necessary.<BR>Answer 12d:  This refers to the government person responsible for funds distribution (functional analyst) being able to administer data as opposed to having to rely on an IT specialist for routine administration functions.<BR>Question 12e: Scalability  Can the system efficiently process the large number of appropriations managed by OSD.<BR>Answer 12e: Scaling data was requested and provided  in questions 4 and 5 above.<BR>Question 12f: Interoperability  How efficiently can the system be integrated with other budget and execution systems. The 64.00 question- it absolutely depends but all ERP are more or less open and the big costs are data and organizational related not technical.<BR>Answer 12f:  Vendor response to interoperability should address the technical aspects of interacting with other DoD budget and execution systems.  <BR>Question 12g: Extensibility  Can the system be deployed for agencies with no funds distribution capability to support lower level funds management capability and can the system be extended to accommodate unique requirements (e.g., Limits). Within the configuration of SAP and to an extent Oracle this is achievable but truly unique requirements may require customization.<BR>Answer 12g: Agree.  The government is looking for a COTS funds distribution product.  Customization is to be minimized and necessary only in extraordinary requirements.<BR>Question 12h: Auditability  How transparent are the records for changes to documents and transactions. SAP can be set up to provide a granular level of traceability but it must be part of the overall GRC plan.<BR>Answer 12h:  Agree.  <BR><BR>Question 13: What are the elements of workflow as the term is being used in this proposal? Does it include the manual triggers, manually generated elements, the interface driven elements, and if so can these be simulated with assumed data and events or will these elements be provided to the offerors?<BR>Answer 13:  The elements of workflow includes but is not limited to document distribution, coordination, and approval both internal  and external to a funds distribution organization; and the process by which an organization chooses to control its funds distribution process within its own organization.<BR><BR>Question 14: In the area of security will the client provide a SOD matrix or a role matrix? <BR>Answer 14: Security specification is not applicable to this action at this time since contractor will not have any interface with any classified data. <BR><BR>Question 15: Will the offerors be able to assume best practices and accepted standards for SOD, integrated security roles are acceptable if they are from an organization such as the ISACA (Previously known as the Information Systems Audit and Control Association, ISACA now goes by its acronym only)?<BR>Answer 15:  Yes.<BR><BR>Question 16: Considering the lack of clear and concise instructions regarding completed demonstration scripts, systems requirements, configuration requirements, security requirements, hardware availability (or requirements for vendor provided hardware) and the incomplete demonstration scenarios without standards for pass/fail and levels of quality, will the Government consider revising the solicitation and extending the demonstration date windows through late February to allow venders a reasonable period to a complete an effective and fair demonstration of capabilities for the Government?<BR>Answer 16:  The government has addressed each of your questions related to instructions, demonstration scripts, systems requirements, configuration requirements, security requirements, hardware availability and demonstration scenarios. The government has already extended the solicitation period and will not extend it further. <BR><BR>Question 17. The answer to question #17 states all work will be performed in the Washington, DC area but does not specify Contractor site or Government site.<BR>a.	Can development (e.g., interface or report development) be performed at a contractor site within the Washington, DC area? <BR>b.	For work to be performed at Government site, what are the clearance requirements?  Will everyone working the project have to be U.S. Citizens?  If the development work can be performed at the Contractor site, are there different security requirements? <BR><BR>Answer 17a:  a)  No.  The contractor should plan to work at a government site.<BR><BR>Answer 17b:  b)  The system and data will be operated in an unclassified site; and data may be labeled For Official Use Only.  U.S. citizenship may be required.<BR><BR>Question 18.  The answer to question #33 states that EFD will be hosted in the Washington , DC area.  Will this be at a government site?  Is the system expected to be unclassified when deployed? <BR><BR>Answer 18:  Yes.  EFD will be hosted at a government site.  The system is expected to be unclassified for the foreseeable future.<BR> <BR>Question 19.  Given the response to question #62, is it correct to assume that whether the work is performed at government or contractor site, the government will provide the hardware to support the development and test environments as well as the production environment?<BR><BR>Answer 19:  Yes.<BR><BR>
