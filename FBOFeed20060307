<CONTACT>Marsha Browning Contracting Officer 4132538236     marsha_browning@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service invites Request for Proposals for the mechanical grinding of vegetation to reduce hazardous fuels loads on approximately 55 acres at the Erie National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Guys Mills, Crawford County, PA.  Approximately 20 acres located on the Mohawk Shrub Fen Area of the Seneca Division  consists of low lying land with pockets of standing water.  The overstory vegetation contains hardwoods with diameters at breast height (DBH) of between 8 and 20 inches.  The understory consists of vines, grasses, shrubs, and downed woody debris.  The objective is to mechanically grind all areas containing multiflora rose, an invasive species.  Large specimen  hardwoods found throughout the fen area shall not be cut and ground.  The actual fen, which is a rare wetland community, shall be marked by the government with pink flagging and is not included in the area to be treated.  The second area is the Sugar Lake Division which has three separate treatment areas for a total of approximately 35 acres.  All three areas, consisting primarily of the non-native Scotch pine, 4"-12" DBH, with occasional mixed hardwoods, spruce and white pine, shall be mechanically cut and ground.  Within the treatment areas there are numerous hardwoods of various sizes ranging from saplings to pole-sized trees.  The objective of the cutting and grinding process is to focus on treating the conifer tree species, and to leave standing as many hardwood trees as practical with the understanding that some hardwood trees must be cut and ground in order to treat the conifer tree species.   Certain trees within each of the three treatment areas have been marked with blue paint as cut and leave trees.  Cut and leave trees shall be severed from the stump and left in place without further grinding with the goal of protecting existing hardwood saplings from deer browse.  Work at all treatment areas in both Divisions SHALL NOT be conducted during the migratory bird nesting season (April 15 through July 15) and during deer hunting season (November 27 through December 9).  The boundaries of the treatment areas in both Divisions are marked with black and blue flagging. The Contractor shall use mechanized equipment to cut and grind the vegetation which WILL NOT remove the vegetation root mat, NOR create any ruts in the soil.  The Contractor shall cut and grind the understory vegetation so the slash remains on-site, and is evenly distributed where the slash does not exceed one (1) foot in height.  Logs slash, or other woody debris shall not be placed in streams channels, drainage ditches, roads, maintained trails or mowed areas.  All trees outside the designated areas shall not be cut or damaged by vegetation cutting operations.  If an undesignated tree is accidentally damaged, the Contractor shall be responsible for correcting the damage using standard arboricultural and pruning techniques.  Vegetation shall be cut and treated so as not to damage adjacent homes, lawns, fences, pools, driveways, sidewalks, streets, buildings, utilities, vehicles or other property both public and private.  TIME FOR COMPLETION-Work shall be completed within one year of the notice to proceed.  The contractor shall schedule work between 7:30 am and 5:30pm, Monday through Friday.  PRE-BID SITE VISIT-One PRE-BID SITE VISIT is scheduled for March 23, 2006 at 8:00 AM.  Interested parties shall meet at the Erie NWR Office, 11296 Wood Duck Lane, Guys Mills, PA  16327.  The refuge is located off Route 198E on Wood Duct Lane, 3/4 mile east of Guys Mills and 10 miles east of Meadville.  In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for any price adjustment.  Questions regarding this scope of work shall be directed to Gerald Vickers at 410-228-2692 ext 123 weekdays between 7:00am and 3:30pm, Fax 410-228-3261 or email Gerald_Vickers@fws.gov.

http://www.arnet.gov/far/farqueryframe.html. 52.204-7. Central Contractor Registration. (Oct 2003) Alternate I (Oct 2003). (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. Alternate I (Oct 2003).  As prescribed in 4.1104(a), substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause: (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR database by December 31, 2003.  The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of the SF 30, Amendment of solicitation/Modification of Contract, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in this contract. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Contractor is registered in the CCR database. Quotes shall include a total price for each of the two items. Quotes are due by close of business 03/20/06 at the SW Idaho/Nevada Acquisition Center, 1249 S. Vinnell Way, Ste 200, Boise, Idaho 83709. FAX quotes will be accepted at 208-373-4197.

<DESC>Solar Energy Technology Program This is not an Acquisition Solicitation.  This is a Financial Assistance Pre-Solicitation Notice for the Solar America Initiative (SAI) Technology Pathway Partnerships Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA).  This notice is to disseminate the opportunity across industry. The Department of Energyâ€™s Solar Energy Technologies Program (SETP) is sponsoring a Technical Exchange Meeting (TEM) to facilitate contributions to planning for the Solar America Initiative.  The goal of the SAI is to make electricity generated by PV systems cost-competitive with other electricity sources by CY2015, promoting commercialization of 5-10 GW of new grid-connected generating capacity by that year. In pursuit of this Initiative, an initial, competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is currently planned for issuance in CY2006.  A Notice of Program Interest (NOPI), DE-PS36-06GO96021, was issued March 3, 2006, requesting industry and stakeholder input for this planned FOA. The NOPI may be accessed at the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at https://e-center.doe.gov/ under Financial Assistance Opportunities. Comments and recommendations received from respondents to this NOPI, as well as discussions of the same critical issues identified in the NOPI at this Technical Exchange Meeting, will have a significant impact on shaping the program direction for the SAI, as well as the content of the initial FOA action.

<SUBJECT>R -- GCCS-J Readiness Assessment System Bridge Contract
<SOLNBR>HC1047-06-R-4015
<RESPDATE>042106
<ARCHDATE>05062006
<CONTACT>Marina Atchison, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-681-0928, Fax 703-681-0346, Email Marina.Atchison@disa.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to award a sole source bridge contract for a five (5) month period of performance to Indus Corporation (formerly Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc.) for Readiness Assessment System (RAS) Support for the Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) program.  It is the Government’s intent to conduct a competition, as previously indicated in a posting to FedBizOpps dated 3 February 2006, under DISA’s NexGen suite of indefinite-delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) small business contracts for these requirements after this bridge contract.  The effective period of this bridge contract will be from 12 May 2006 through 11 October 2006.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), implemented under FAR 6.302-1 which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time frame.  The present contract with Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. will end on 11 May 2006.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  The GCCS-J is tasked to provide a single joint command and control (C2) system that allows seamless integration of information for the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJSC), the Combatant Commanders, and the military services providing joint and multinational operations for the 21st century.  The system supports the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, CJSC, Combatant Commands, and services by providing synchronized operations from disperse locations and provides joint command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) to support the entire force protection cycle.  As such, the system provides responsive command and control, the capability to assess the level of success, and retains flexibility to re-engage with precision by allowing the Joint Task Force commander the ability to maintain dominant battlefield awareness through a fused, integrated, near real-time picture of the battle space.

It is critical that the Government retain the services of Indus Corporation (formerly Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc.) through the testing phases of the GCCS-J Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS ) Strategic Server Enclave Version 4.1 release that is to be delivered on 1 May 2006.  Although the current period of performance under the existing contract HC1047-04-C-4056 will permit delivery of software items, there will not be sufficient time for completion of Government testing to validate that the required functionality is contained within the deliverables and functions adequately.

Under this bridge contract, the contractor will be required to fix any latent defects uncovered as part of Government testing.  This SORTS release will contain significant functional enhancements mandated by the Joint Staff and critical program office required architectural changes.  The complexity of this release makes it exceedingly difficult for another contractor, not fully involved with the development process, to take over testing and to fix any problems that might arise.  GCCS-J program-related changes have already caused release schedules to shift several times.  These program-related changes have caused this subsequent realignment of the SORTS V4.1 release and the need for this sole source bridge contract. 

The Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services Engineering Directorate (GE), GCCS-J Force Readiness Products Branch (CC35) accomplishes its mission by providing a variety of Readiness Assessment Systems (RAS) in support of the CJCS.  These systems are developed and fielded in an evolutionary manner through distinct phases and increments.  These systems include the Global SORTS (GSORTS), which is a mission application of the GCCS-J that provides access to the SORTS joint database.  The SORTS is an information management system within the DoD that provides the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff with authoritative information on the identification, location, resources, and readiness of U.S. Armed Forces units.  Other related RAS maintained by CC35 include:  Global Online Marine Edit and Report System (GOMERS), which provides SORTS data entry tool support for the Marine Corps;  RAS Input Tool (RAS IT), a web-based GCCS application which provides a common easy-to-use SORTS reporting tool in support of the Chairman’s Readiness System;  and the RAS Output Tool (RAS OT), a web-based GCCS-J application which provides an improved user-friendly analysis and graphical display of readiness and operation plan data.

In order to meet planned testing and field obligations, it is critical that the technical expertise provided by the current contractor not be interrupted during this five (5) month bridge contract period.  This effort will provide a continuation of support until award of the competitive contract under the DISA NexGen suite of indefinite-delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) small business contracts. 

Tasks to be accomplished under this sole source bridge contract include:

Readiness Assessment System Support:  Perform requirements analysis support, maintenance of software scripts or segments to promote interoperability, provide missing functionality, and add additional configuration data, as tasked.  Correct all RAS defects associated with the GCCS-J Global/SORTS baselines, as directed by the task monitor.

Segment/Patch Preparation:  The contractor shall prepare software segments/patches for the purpose of incorporating deficiency corrections and software modifications for all RAS software, as directed by the task monitor.

Testing:  Install, verify, and control the correct hardware and software configuration to ensure correct test baseline on the test systems.  Plan and conduct testing in accordance with the Software Test Plans of segments, mission applications, databases, associated interfaces, integrated subsystems, and system builds.  Perform analysis of Integration and Run Time Specification (I&RTS) compliance, performance, functionality, security, problem reports, and documentation.

Engineering Support for Fielded Systems:  Provide post-deployment engineering support, including maintenance of hardware and software, system management backup and recovery, configuration management of software and hardware, and system and network security.  Provide database administration, including creating and managing user accounts and passwords, supporting vulnerability alert processes, maintaining system administration accreditation, and providing technical assistance to users in direct support of all RAS software issues associated with integration, transition planning, installation, and system configuration.

Contract Level (Task) Management, as directed by the task monitor.

Indus Corporation (formerly Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc.) has the only RAS subject matter experts (SMEs) capable of troubleshooting and fixing the current deliverables under Contract HC1047-04-C-4056 for worldwide fielding of the GCCS-J Global V4.0 release.  As such, there will be no interruptions to services.

These SMEs have critical cross-functional knowledge of the SORTS and Joint Planning and Execution System (JOPES) operational requirements.  This is critical to the success of the SORTS and Global Operational Tests.  These engineers will be able to take immediate action to provide support to each phase of testing, thereby preserving the integrity of the systems, in the event problems arise.  In the past, these engineers have maintained constant vigilance by monitoring the flow of more than seven million data records while the team maintained dual operational capability.

Given the complexity and uniqueness of the current readiness system, the impending release of new Readiness assessment applications with the historical database scheduled for 1 May 2006, and the ongoing restructuring of the SORTS database to support new requirements, it is not likely that another contractor would be capable of successfully providing the Readiness Assessment System Support Services during this critical time period.

The current program fielding schedule for GCCS-J Global V4.0 coincides with the end of the current contract HC1047-04-C-4056 with Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. (now Indus Corporation).  Disruption in providing SMEs to the current fielding teams would drastically impact the GCCS-J mission to provide the warfighter with the capabilities for timely, accurate, and secure input of force readiness data during essential operations.

Significant changes will be made to the force readiness applications by the incumbent contractor just prior to the end of contract HC1047-04-C-4056 on 11 May 2006.  These changes include:

Functional requirements changes (e.g., RAS OT redesign, establishment of XML data transfer/reporting from Navy to SORTS, streamlining RAMP message processing and accessibility for Navy, create joint/BSA registration/reporting capability, and several other approved GRID requirements).

Critical security enhancements for the RAS IT.

Architectural changes for BEA Web Logic, JAVA 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE Deploy Tool), SAFE, Mozilla, and Windows Client XP.

Interested parties may provide substantial documentation that addresses the requirements in this announcement in order for the Government to determine if your company is able to do the work required.  This is an on-going requirement and no break in services will be acceptable.  Responses must be received by noon (local time) on Friday, 21 April 2006.  Responses may be submitted by facsimile to Marina Atchison at (703) 681-0346 or by e-mail to marina.atchison@disa.mil.  No costs will be paid by the Government for responses submitted.  Responses will not be returned.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  See numbered note 22.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed bridge contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for this bridge effort.

<CONTACT>Rhonda LaGarde, Contracting Officer, Phone (703)681-1250, Fax (703)681-1211, Email Rhonda.LaGarde@disa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to issue a solicitation to Harris RF Communications Division, 1680 University Avenue Rochester, NY 14610 for AN/PRC-117F software improvements.  The AN/PRC-117 software will implement, integrate, test and certify the latest approved Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) military standards (i.e. MIL-STD-188-181C, -182B and –183B, also known as the Integrated Waveform (IW).   In addition the contractor will provide modification to the technical manuals, training materials, training classes, and technical assistance to upload the software to fielded terminals.

The UHF SATCOM system provides the US Department of Defense (DoD) and other US Government departments and agencies critical beyond line-of-sight communications for tactical and special forces operations.  UHF SATCOM is the only commercial or military system that can operate under all weather conditions and cover.  However, the currently implemented UHF SATCOM Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) waveforms (MIL-STD-188-181B, -182A and –183A) is no longer technologically current, efficient and effective to fulfill the UHF SATCOM user operational requirements. DISA revised the UHF SATCOM standards to IW, which maintains consistency with user needs and evolving technology.  To achieve the IW benefits for present operations, DoD has selected a number of user terminal types that must be upgraded to IW.  The AN/PRC-117F is one of these types of terminals.

The intended contract will be for IW Phase-I, which will implement MIL-STD-188-181C and MIL-STD-188–183B and will provide maximum benefit to the warfighter in a shortened development time.  This phase is estimated at 15 staff years of work.  This phase will support single access (one NET per channel) and multiple access (multiple networks per channel using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)).  The intended contract will also include an option for Phase II, which will implement MIL-STD-188-182B for demand assignment capability and is estimated at 12 staff years of work.

<SUBJECT>D -- MD-1324/RT-18XX Integrated Waveform (IW) Software
<SOLNBR>HC1047-06-R-4018
<ARCHDATE>04302006
<CONTACT>Rhonda LaGarde, Contracting Officer, Phone (703)681-1250, Fax (703)681-1211, Email Rhonda.LaGarde@disa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to issue a solicitation to ViaSat Corporation, 6155 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA, for MD-1324/RT-18XX software improvements that implement the latest approved Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) military standards (i.e. MIL-STD-188-181C, -182B and –183B also known as the IW).  The contractor will integrate, test and certify the IW software, which was developed for the PSC-5 family of radios under a separate contract, into the MD-1324/RT-18XX modems and terminals.  In addition, the contractor will provide modification to the technical manuals, training materials, training classes, and technical assistance to upload the IW software to fielded terminals.

The UHF SATCOM system provides the US Department of Defense (DoD) and other US Government departments and agencies critical beyond line-of-sight communications for tactical and special forces operations.  UHF SATCOM is the only commercial or military system that can operate under all weather conditions and cover.  However, the currently implemented UHF SATCOM Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) waveforms (MIL-STD-188-181B, -182A and –183A) are no longer technologically current, efficient and effective to fulfill the UHF SATCOM user operational requirements.  DISA revised the UHF SATCOM standards to IW, which maintains consistency with user needs and evolving technology.  To achieve the IW benefits for present operations, DoD has selected a number of user terminal types that must be upgraded to IW.  The MD-1324/RT-18XX modems and terminals are among the terminal types selected.

The intended contract will be for IW Phase I, which will implement MIL-STD-188-181C and MIL-STD-188–183B and will provide maximum benefit to the warfighter in a shortened development time.  The work is estimated at 5 staff years.  This phase will support single access (one NET per channel) and multiple access (multiple networks per channel using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)).  The intended contract will also include an option for Phase II, which will implement MIL-STD-188-182B for demand assignment capability and is estimated at 20 man-years of work. The Phase-II software developed under this option will be used to upgrade the modems for the PSC-5 family of radios in addition to the MD-1324/RT-18XX  modems and terminals.  Award is expected during fourth quarter FY06.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to issue a solicitation to ViaSat Corporation, 6155 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA, for the development of Integrated Waveform (IW) software for the Network Controller Subsystem (NCS) of Joint (UHF) MILSATCOM Network Integrated (Control System) (JMINI) Initial Operating Capability (IOC).  The IW software implements the latest approved Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) military standards (i.e. MIL-STD-188-181C and MIL-STD-188-185).  The contractor will develop, integrate, test and certify the IW software for the NCS.   In addition, the contractor will provide modification to the technical manuals, training materials, training classes, and technical assistance to upload the IW software to fielded terminals via the NCS.

The UHF SATCOM system provides the US Department of Defense (DoD) and other US Government departments and agencies critical beyond line-of-sight communications for tactical and special forces operations.  UHF SATCOM is the only commercial or military system that can operate under all weather conditions and cover.  However, the currently implemented UHF SATCOM Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) waveforms (MIL-STD-188-181B, -182A and –183A) are no longer technologically current, efficient and effective to fulfill the UHF SATCOM user operational requirements.  DISA revised the UHF SATCOM standards to IW, which maintains consistency with user needs and evolving technology.  To achieve the IW benefits for present operations, DOD has selected a number of user terminal types, which must be upgraded to IW.  The NCS is the system that will provide the IW control for those terminals. 

The intended contract is for two IW phases, which will implement MIL-STD-188-181C and MIL-STD-188–185 and will provide maximum benefit to the warfighter in a shortened development time.  Phase-I will support single access (one NET per channel) and multiple access (multiple networks per channel using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)).  The work is estimated at 5 staff years.  Phase-II will support demand assignment capability and is estimated at 20 staff years of work.  The IW software developed under both Phase-I and Phase-II will be integrated into the NCS that will provide the IW control for the terminals.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Mary C. Rico, 301-619-8669
<DESC>1.	The Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security proposes to establish and award a Contract for a Federally Funded Research and Development Center to operate the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The NBACC facility will provide the nation with biocontainment laboratory space for biological threat characterization and bioforensic work.  The programs conducted at the NBACC will provide knowledge  of infectious properties of biological agents, (select agents) effectiveness of countermeasures (i.e., detectors, drugs, vaccines and decontamination procedures) and forensics analyses to support policy makers and responders' development of policies, prog rams and technologies.  2.	By The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296, as amended), Congress  authorized, at Sections 305 and 308, DHS to establish one or more FFRDCs to assist the DHS in formulating and addressing important homeland security issues, particularly those where scientific, technical and analytical expertise is involved, such as biolog ical threat characterization and bioforensic analysis.  3.	DHS is the ultimate sponsor of the NBACC; however, the Science and  Technology Directorate (DHS (S&T)) should be viewed as its primary sponsor. In  general, the DHS (S&T) will provide business, financial and contractual oversight.              	The NBACC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs  of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust.  Any subsidiary relationship the NBACC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such par ent organizations.  Work performed by the NBACC for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS (S&T).  4.

Upon completion of construction of the new NBACC Facility, or acceptance of beneficial occupancy to the NBACC Facility by the Government, the  NBACC Contractor shall begin an orderly and programmed transition of all performance of the NBACC management function including moving employees into the new NBACC Facility at Fort Detrick, MD. 5.	The work to be performed under this contract will involve access to, handling of and generation of classified information up to and including Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). 6.	The Contractor shall provide a wide range of research, studies, analyses, analytic and computational models, simulations, and other technical and analytical support useful for policy and program planning, and management by its Sponsors.  This Contract w ill result in a completely new management and support mechanism for DHS.  The NBACC will assist DHS in establishing an enduring national capability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from bioterrorist attack, and support DHS in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to terrorist attack and major disasters involving biological threat agents.  The work will be focused in three areas of need - NBACC Contract Core Support, Biological Threat Characterization and Bioforensic Analysis competenci es as mentioned herein. (a)	Core Support includes the efforts of the Contractor to support DHS NBACC  Program Management.  It includes: 	Efforts associated with the required workload to consult widely with  representatives from private industry, institutions of higher education, and  nonprofit institutions. 	Efforts to exercise sound financial control over the Contractor's resources.  	Work on special projects to complement requirements and provide quick  response analytic support. 	Concept formulation research, as directed by DHS as necessary to support  strategic planning by providing a forward-looking perspective, which can  anticipate problems and issues to preclude simply reacting to events. 	Submission of Quarterly Progress Reports, Technical Reports, Final Technical Reports, Monthly Quality Control and Financial Reports. (b)	 Biological Threat Characterization support includes: 	Providing biological threat awareness and characterization for the nation. 	Leveraging the existing National Biological Threat Characterization Program  Plan and partners and leveraging dedicated program personnel to guarantee optimal program execution continuity and minimize program development redundancies. 	Developing a seamless program and execution transition strategy to ensure the optimal and efficient execution of the program into the new NBACC facility. 	Maintaining and utilizing the capability to conduct testing of aerosolized high hazard threat agents against animals, bench research on threat agents, and  bioforensics analysis. 	Adopting, advancing and evolving the existing National Biological Threat  Characterization Program, its requirements and execution strategy. (c) 	 Bioforensic Analysis support includes:  	Providing a full-scale operational bioforensics capability. 	Developing, evaluating and validating physical and chemical analytical tools and procedures to support bioforensic casework. 	Conducting bioforensic research and casework. 	Establishing, evaluating and validating methods to identify and characterize threat agents. 	Establishing bioforensic reference collections for comparative identification. 	Establishing and maintaining third party ISO 17025 accreditation of  bioforensic casework. 	Establishing a capability to support traditional forensic analysis within  biocontainment laboratories with threat agent contaminated evidentiary samples. 	Maintaining the integrity of law enforcement sensitive work, meeting the  evidence handling and storage standards of a crime laboratory and in a method  acceptable to the lead law enforcement agency. 	Providing expert witness testimony to support criminal prosecutions and other attribution inquiries. 	Maintaining and enhancing the facilities to perform bioforensic work  (coordination with appropriate Government agencies is required). These needs are expected to evolve over time, and the Contractor's capabilities and areas of concentration will evolve accordingly.   7.	A Request for Proposal is planned for release 14 March 2006 with proposals due 28 April 2006.  The selection decision is anticipated to be made in June 2006. 8.	The complete solicitation package will be available electronically at  www.usamraa.army.mil.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be provided.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on a project to extend the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) Bi-SC AIS (Bi-Strategic Commands Automated Information System) Core to the NU (NATO Unclassified) Network.

Within the Bi-SC AIS there is a need to provide cost effective, secure, interoperable, survivable and robust NATO Unclassified Public Access Local Area Network (PA LAN) capabilities between Allied Command Operations (ACO) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and ensure interoperability with National Information Systems, which are connected to the Internet. These capabilities will be implemented for the different NATO Commands by multiple NATO Host Nations. This Contract will need to deliver PA LAN facilities at SHAPE and NCSA (NATO CIS Services Agency) Headquarters in Mons, Belgium, and will run in parallel with other Host Nation Contracts, which will deliver PA LAN facilities in the Commands in their Nations.

The main purpose of the project is to ensure that the SHAPE - NCSA PA LAN is standardized and upgraded to be compliant with PA LANs throughout the Bi-SC AIS, and thus create a consistent baseline in the NU domain space. The main project objective will be to extend the Bi-SC Core Capability to the PA domains and provide a secure Remote Access solution that will be used by all Commands.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. Contractor selection will be based on the lowest compliant bid (One Envelope Procedure). All bids submitted in response to this IFB shall show the minimum validity of 12 (twelve) months from the bid closing date.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 8.4 million (USD $9.9 million). 

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11910-BISC-SHAPE. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

Only companies from the Participating NATO nations are eligible to engage in this competitive bidding process. In addition, all contractors, sub-contractors and manufacturers, at any tier, must be from participating countries. None of the work, including project design, labor and services shall be performed other than by firms from and within participating countries.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The IFB package shall not contain material of a classified nature. Prospective bidders, however, should be aware that contractor personnel may be called upon to work at a NATO site in connection with the contract and such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET inclusive. All such personnel clearances must be in place prior to contract award.

As the PA LAN is a NATO Unclassified Network, it will be based on standard COTS equipment.

This project will provide SHAPE and NCSA:

- Computers, Laptops and Peripheral Equipment
- Networking Hardware, including switches, racks, local cable and wiring
- Servers to support Firewall, DBMS, DMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage and Infrastructure Services
- OEM versions of Operating System Software
- Hard/software to support security service requirements 
- Replacement of any substandard hardware
- A secure Remote Access Capability to allow users to access their mail and files when at home or on travel
- Contract Support to install the system and, where required, do the system transition work required
- Migration of Data on workstations and servers
- Internet Access Gateway
- Enterprise migration/setup for connected commands

The Contractor shall provide an integrated system solution, utilizing as much as possible the existing infrastructure, procuring all additional necessary hardware, software, components, cables and connectors, and install, configure, test and achieve acceptance by NATO.

This project will ensure that any existing or new client or server will be migrated to Windows XP/Windows 2003.

The Contractor will install, integrate and test all equipment and configure all components based on NATO Bi-SC AIS Configuration Baseline.

The remote access solution will need to provide authentication and identity management and access control at a granular level.

The Contractor will be asked to provide comprehensive Management and Logistic Support plans. This would include, but may not be limited to, providing spare parts, warranty, periodic and emergency maintenance, technical documentation, as well as training.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 27 March 2006

The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.<br><br>

All capabilities statements received by 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time, 16 March 2006, will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.

Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested party to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the capabilities of the alternate equipment.<br><br> 

The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis for the equipment based upon the responses received.  The Government will not pay for any information received.<br><br>

This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The Bishop Group, Inc. developed a risk approach specifically tailored for the LCS MIW Mission Package (Risk Management Approach for LCS MIW Mission Package).  The extensive and unique experience of their personnel in expeditionary and mine warfare and prior LCS risk work provide unique expertise in the development of the needed MIW Mission Package risk program.  Use of any other source would involve an expensive and time-consuming learning curve that would not support the program's aggressive schedule.  NAICS Code is 541611, FSC Code is R425.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Curtiss Wright Embedded Computer Systems of Huntsville, AL for procurement of  the following items: Part Name SVME 181 Boards, 500MHz 7410 CPU,512 MB SDRAM, 48MB Flash, Power PC Board; Manufacturer Part No. SVME-181-000; Quantity 12 each. Part Name VXWorks Driver for the IP4-206,Digital I/O Industry Pack Module; Manufacturer Part No. DSW-206-000-CD; Quantity 1 each. Part Name Front Panel Breakout Cable; Manufacturer Part No.CBL-SBC-FPL-000; Quantity 12 each. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: Lockheed Martin, the sole AN/WLD-1 developer, used SVME 181 boards from Curtiss Wright to populate the simulation boards of the RMV/DLS Sim Stim.  These boards provide the correct voltages and enable internal communication among other related hardware of the RMV/DLS Sim Stim. It is critical that the NSWC PC Sim Stim be configured identically to the Lockheed Martin Sim Stim to ensure consistency of data and test results. For this reason the SVME boards from Curtiss Wright are required so that the RMV/DLS Sim Stim simulation operates and executes the binary images identically to the Lockheed Martin system. Use of any other component would require extensive and costly re-testing to ensure performance compatibility. NAICS 421430. FSC 5963

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Thomas Martinez, Purchasing Agent, Phone (703) 308-7461
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   NAICS code 541990:     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Julie Kimble of CIIT Centers for Health Research. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.  The basis of this determination is that the U.S. EPA, National Center for Environmental Assessment, previously awarded a Purchase Order, 2RN018-QT-0H-05-000006 and Cooperative Agreement CR 820429 to Dr. Kimble.  The National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the Environmental Protection Agency proposes this project to assure accurate estimates of dosimetry to nasal tissue in rats, obtained using so-called hybrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)  models, since these estimates are being proposed with greater frequency as the basis for dose-metric extrapolation of inhalation toxicity endpoints from rats to humans.  Within such hybrid CFD-PBPK models, a set of constants which define the air-phase resistance to mass transfer (denoted kGs) were  previously estimated using an incomplete CFD model of the rat nose and in some cases appear to have been inappropriately integrated into the CFD-PBPK models due to the way multiple resistances were quantified.  Since 1) nasal tissues are fairly often targets of inhaled toxic compounds; 2) hazard  and dose-response data for such endpoints are often obtained in experimental studies with rats; and 3) it is EPA's goal to make use of the best available science, we seek to update these kGs using the improved, complete rat nasal CFD models now available.  This specific project will also implement  a procedure where the simulated absorption of a gas in the anterior portion of the rat nose is set to zero when estimating gas-phase resistance in posterior regions to avoid numerical instability and inaccuracy that otherwise can occur.  Thus it will utilize state-of-the-science methods to estimate  dosimetry parameters in an important test species.  The contractor will accomplish this work using existing rat CFD models which they have already developed independently.   The published results of this project could potentially be applied directly to Agency inhalation dosimetry and to risk  assessment procedures for inter-species extrapolation.        The National Center for Environmental Assessment is seeking to contract with Dr. Julia Kimbell of the CIIT Centers for Health Research to provide expertise in the highly specialized area of application of inhalation dosimetry in the  respiratory tract to address issues of test-animal dosimetry estimation for use in inter-species extrapolation. Through her current work, Dr. Kimbell has developed a body of intellectual property in the form of unique, sophisticated, computational models that describe inspired air flow in areas of  the respiratory tract relevant for risk assessment.  These models have been developed for rats as well as monkeys and for a number of individual humans using anatomically accurate reconstructions of nasal anatomy.  These models therefore provide a unique opportunity to accurately predict regional  dosimetry in both experimental animals and humans.   Although the information on these models have been or will be published, the specific computational analyses needed to update the gas phase mass transfer resistances have not been performed and are otherwise not being planned.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with North American Hoganas, Inc., 111 Hoganas Way, Hollsopple, PA  15935-6416.  NAH is the only known qualified source to perform this effort.  AFRL/MNMW desires to purchase small melts (heats) of experimental steels for evaluation in the AWEF Dynamic Properties Laboratory for application to future “high speed penetrator” programs.  In order to develop and produce these more advanced steel and ensure the proper quality control requirements are met, the Government requirement mandates using the production process of (1) Electric Arc Furnace melting with Induction Stirring, (2) Ladle Refining with Argon Purging Capabilities and (3) Vacuum Degassing Treatment.  Production of the experimental steels will be in small, 5 ton increments totaling approximately 20 tons.  Market research indicates that NAH is uniquely capable of producing small melts (5 tons) to the production methods outlined above.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience with steel melting process of (1) Electric Arc Furnace melting with Induction Stirring, (2) Ladle Refining with Argon Purging Capabilities and (3) Vacuum Degassing Treatment in small melts (heats).  Submit SOCs within 15 days of publication to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn: Mark Fitzgerald, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810.  Please refer technical questions to Morris Dilmore at (850) 882-9644 and contractual questions to Mark Fitzgerald at (850) 883-2670.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Mr. Dennis Love, AAC/XP, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-0312.     Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT); 501 East Saint Joseph Street; Rapid City, SD 57701 to provide the following:  (a) Critical and final design of the Sample Concentrator Delivery Sy stem (SCDS) to include; (b) Technical input on the integration of the final designed SDSMT SCDS with the final-designed CB007 Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) (to become the real-time detector) and with the Aerosol-Vapor-Liquid Assessment Group A VLAG fixture; (c) Technical input on the validation of the real-time detector/AVLAG system with various chemical simulants; (d) Capabilities to provide up to 60 additional similar GCMS systems to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during FY07-08; (e) Co nceptual and critical design, modeling, assembly, and testing of a new AVLAG cell prototype. Thermodynamics and wind flows of the new cell design will be modeled during development.  Development will be included in quarterly report.  The following paramete rs will be considered in the design: lower density metal, thinner walled cell, and smaller sized swatch; (f) Technical input into the design of a cell that incorporates over pressure on the underside of the swatch within the AVLAG system; (g) Development, assembly, and testing of a new AVLAG 10-cell fixture prototype with temperature, humidity, flow and pressure control testing (to be used as a test bed in subsequent testing within this statement of work).  Testing will be performed that will determine temp erature characteristics of the swatch within a current AVLAG cell in relation to convective properties of the air outside the cell to determine convective influence on internal cell temperatures.  This information will be leveraged into the CBART COLPRO fi xture development process; (h) Preparation of presentations for and-or attendance at the following meetings; (i) Technical input into the development of peer review papers to cover SCDS hardware and software development with simulants, dilute and neat agen ts at DPG; (j) Semi-weekly teleconferences; (k) Quarterly reports and a final comprehensive data report on the SCDS system at the end of the contract year; (l) Delivery of SCDS Documentation: Operators Manual and Maintenance Manual.  The tentative period of performance for the requirement is from April 15, 2006 to April 14, 2009.  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on  contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.  This contract is a follow-on effort to achieve requirements that are important to the overall real-time  detector effort and are specific to what SDSMT has completed over the past 2 years.  The work required involves the iterative critical and final design process that is important in the completion of the development of the preconcentrator. The work require d also involves the integration of the SCDS onto the miniature GCMS, and validation on the AVLAG swatch fixture.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agenc y.  Supporting evidence must be furnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with the Government's requirements.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with sole source negotiations with SDSMT.  The solicitation (W911S6-06-R-0010) wil l be available on or around 21 MAR 2006 through the Army Single Face to Industry website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ or through the U.S. Army Contract ing Agency - Dugway Proving Ground website at https://www. dugway.army.mil/10-3_ContractingDivision.htm (NOTE: When accessing either the Army Single Face to Industry or the Dugway Proving Ground websites, make sure the web address begins with https not htt p to gain access to the secure web servers.

<DESC>RDECOM Acquisition Center anticipates awarding a sole source contract to Applied Marine Technology, Inc. to assist in three major sustainment efforts undergoing by the Chemical Detection Engineering Team (CDET).  First, the assistance of the M256 Low  Volatility Hazard (LVH) Integrated Process Team (IPT) in a Product Improvement Program that expands the capability of the M256A1 Chemical Detector Kit by providing a means to detect LVH.  Second, technical consulting support to assist the Improved Chemica l Agent Monitor High Temperature IPT to resolve technical issues identified in the ICAM by the RESET team.  Third, a subject matter expert on chemical detection to provide technical consulting support to review and evaluate emerging technologies to improve , modernize, and reduce life cycle cost of existing fielded detection equipment.  The need for the technical consulting support from Applied Marine Technology, Inc. is critical to the success of these three major sustainment efforts to ensure quality produ cts get delivered into the hands of the warfighters.  Sole source award of this effort to Applied Marine Technology, Inc. is justified because of the direct working knowledge and experience in current M256A1 Chemical Detection Kits and ICAM High Storage su stainment efforts over the past two years. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous notice is to correct information regarding the status of Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc..  The parent company of Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. is Indus Corporation.  This five month sole source bridge contract will be awarded to Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc., the current incumbent contractor under HC1047-04-C-4056.

*****

NOTICE OF INTENT:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to award a sole source bridge contract for a five (5) month period of performance to Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. for Readiness Assessment System (RAS) Support for the Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) program.  It is the Government’s intent to conduct a competition, as previously indicated in a posting to FedBizOpps dated 3 February 2006, under DISA’s NexGen suite of indefinite-delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) small business contracts for these requirements after this bridge contract.  The effective period of this bridge contract will be from 12 May 2006 through 11 October 2006.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), implemented under FAR 6.302-1 which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time frame.  The present contract with Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. will end on 11 May 2006.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  The GCCS-J is tasked to provide a single joint command and control (C2) system that allows seamless integration of information for the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJSC), the Combatant Commanders, and the military services providing joint and multinational operations for the 21st century.  The system supports the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, CJSC, Combatant Commands, and services by providing synchronized operations from disperse locations and provides joint command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) to support the entire force protection cycle.  As such, the system provides responsive command and control, the capability to assess the level of success, and retains flexibility to re-engage with precision by allowing the Joint Task Force commander the ability to maintain dominant battlefield awareness through a fused, integrated, near real-time picture of the battle space.

It is critical that the Government retain the services of Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. through the testing phases of the GCCS-J Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) Strategic Server Enclave Version 4.1 release that is to be delivered on 1 May 2006.  Although the current period of performance under the existing contract HC1047-04-C-4056 will permit delivery of software items, there will not be sufficient time for completion of Government testing to validate that the required functionality is contained within the deliverables and functions adequately.

Under this bridge contract, the contractor will be required to fix any latent defects uncovered as part of Government testing.  This SORTS release will contain significant functional enhancements mandated by the Joint Staff and critical program office required architectural changes.  The complexity of this release makes it exceedingly difficult for another contractor, not fully involved with the development process, to take over testing and to fix any problems that might arise.  GCCS-J program-related changes have already caused release schedules to shift several times.  These program-related changes have caused this subsequent realignment of the SORTS V4.1 release and the need for this sole source bridge contract. 

The Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services Engineering Directorate (GE), GCCS-J Force Readiness Products Branch (CC35) accomplishes its mission by providing a variety of Readiness Assessment Systems (RAS) in support of the CJCS.  These systems are developed and fielded in an evolutionary manner through distinct phases and increments.  These systems include the Global SORTS (GSORTS), which is a mission application of the GCCS-J that provides access to the SORTS joint database.  The SORTS is an information management system within the DoD that provides the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff with authoritative information on the identification, location, resources, and readiness of U.S. Armed Forces units.  Other related RAS maintained by CC35 include:  Global Online Marine Edit and Report System (GOMERS), which provides SORTS data entry tool support for the Marine Corps;  RAS Input Tool (RAS IT), a web-based GCCS application which provides a common easy-to-use SORTS reporting tool in support of the Chairman’s Readiness System;  and the RAS Output Tool (RAS OT), a web-based GCCS-J application which provides an improved user-friendly analysis and graphical display of readiness and operation plan data.

In order to meet planned testing and field obligations, it is critical that the technical expertise provided by the current contractor not be interrupted during this five (5) month bridge contract period.  This effort will provide a continuation of support until award of the competitive contract under the DISA NexGen suite of indefinite-delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) small business contracts. 

Tasks to be accomplished under this sole source bridge contract include:

Readiness Assessment System Support:  Perform requirements analysis support, maintenance of software scripts or segments to promote interoperability, provide missing functionality, and add additional configuration data, as tasked.  Correct all RAS defects associated with the GCCS-J Global/SORTS baselines, as directed by the task monitor.

Segment/Patch Preparation:  The contractor shall prepare software segments/patches for the purpose of incorporating deficiency corrections and software modifications for all RAS software, as directed by the task monitor.

Testing:  Install, verify, and control the correct hardware and software configuration to ensure correct test baseline on the test systems.  Plan and conduct testing in accordance with the Software Test Plans of segments, mission applications, databases, associated interfaces, integrated subsystems, and system builds.  Perform analysis of Integration and Run Time Specification (I&RTS) compliance, performance, functionality, security, problem reports, and documentation.

Engineering Support for Fielded Systems:  Provide post-deployment engineering support, including maintenance of hardware and software, system management backup and recovery, configuration management of software and hardware, and system and network security.  Provide database administration, including creating and managing user accounts and passwords, supporting vulnerability alert processes, maintaining system administration accreditation, and providing technical assistance to users in direct support of all RAS software issues associated with integration, transition planning, installation, and system configuration.

Contract Level (Task) Management, as directed by the task monitor.

Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. has the only RAS subject matter experts (SMEs) capable of troubleshooting and fixing the current deliverables under Contract HC1047-04-C-4056 for worldwide fielding of the GCCS-J Global V4.0 release.  As such, there will be no interruptions to services.

These SMEs have critical cross-functional knowledge of the SORTS and Joint Planning and Execution System (JOPES) operational requirements.  This is critical to the success of the SORTS and Global Operational Tests.  These engineers will be able to take immediate action to provide support to each phase of testing, thereby preserving the integrity of the systems, in the event problems arise.  In the past, these engineers have maintained constant vigilance by monitoring the flow of more than seven million data records while the team maintained dual operational capability.

Given the complexity and uniqueness of the current readiness system, the impending release of new Readiness assessment applications with the historical database scheduled for 1 May 2006, and the ongoing restructuring of the SORTS database to support new requirements, it is not likely that another contractor would be capable of successfully providing the Readiness Assessment System Support Services during this critical time period.

The current program fielding schedule for GCCS-J Global V4.0 coincides with the end of the current contract HC1047-04-C-4056 with Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc..  Disruption in providing SMEs to the current fielding teams would drastically impact the GCCS-J mission to provide the warfighter with the capabilities for timely, accurate, and secure input of force readiness data during essential operations.

Significant changes will be made to the force readiness applications by the incumbent contractor just prior to the end of contract HC1047-04-C-4056 on 11 May 2006.  These changes include:

Functional requirements changes (e.g., RAS OT redesign, establishment of XML data transfer/reporting from Navy to SORTS, streamlining RAMP message processing and accessibility for Navy, create joint/BSA registration/reporting capability, and several other approved GRID requirements).

Critical security enhancements for the RAS IT.

Architectural changes for BEA Web Logic, JAVA 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE Deploy Tool), SAFE, Mozilla, and Windows Client XP.

Interested parties may provide substantial documentation that addresses the requirements in this announcement in order for the Government to determine if your company is able to do the work required.

The interests described above include those of the partner, its affiliates, proposed consultants, or proposed subcontractors.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. When a request for quotations is issued, it is expected that only those responding to this information request will be asked to respond to the RFQ. The partner(s) selected through that process will be asked to provide, at no cost to the Department of Justice or the MEO, the necessary conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates to be responsive to the requirements of the DOJ competitive sourcing solicitation. 

Upon Department of Justice selection of the winning offer of the standard competition, it is anticipated that the JAWS proposal would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). However, as the MEO, we cannot guarantee that this partnering opportunity will result in the award of any contracts by the Government, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment by the Department of Justice to pay for the information this notice is soliciting.

The preferred method of response to this notice is via email to: Bob.JAWS@comcast.net. The MEO has an interest in making its decision on partnering opportunities as soon as practical. Toward this end, the due date for submission of responses to this notice will be COB March 20, 2006.

A:  The basic intent is to take the schematic design and develop it into construction documents.  The Government is not seeking a new design concept.  Suggestions enhancing functionality will be encouraged, but in general these changes should be relatively minor compared to a whole new design. 3.  Q:  HOW MUCH INFORMATION DO WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR OUR TEAM - AT WHAT SUBCONTRACTOR/SUBCONSULTANT LEVEL?      A:  You should provide enough information you deem necessary based on the evaluation criteria cited in the RFQ. 4.  Q:  HOW DOES THIS PROJECT RELATE TO THE KOHM YAH-MAH-NEE VISITOR FACILITY AND THE SOUTHWEST FACILITY?      A:  This project is a re-design/re-solicitation of effort previously advertised as the Kohm Yah-Man-Nee Visitor Facility and the Southwest Visitor Facility.  These are the same facility that is currently advertised. 5.  Q:  SINCE THIS PROJECT IS SOLICITED FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, WILL THERE BE ANY PRICE PREFERENCE FOR SMALL DISADVANTAGED OR HUBZONE FIRMS?      A:  FAR Clause 52.219-4 - "Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns (Jul 2005)" will be included in the Phase 2 RFP Package.

<CONTACT>Paula Frickey, NOAA Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-4791, Fax 301-427-2164, Email paula.frickey@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) intends to extend an existing sole-source contract with Harris Corporation effective May 1, 2006, through April 30, 2007, for a period of 12 months due to significant resource issues at the NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) from November 2004 to the present time.  However, it is the government’s intent to conduct a competition after this bridge contract.  The purpose of this contract is to provide Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) support for the DOC/NOAA/NESDIS/NPOESS program.  Further, the Government requires an enduring and survivable capability to provide the United States military with accurate worldwide weather information. This capability is provided by the DMSP, which collects and disseminates global visible and infrared cloud data in support of worldwide operations and high priority programs.  The global data must be provided in a timely manner to users at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC).  The DoD also needs a capability to collect and disseminate other specialized meteorological, terrestrial, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical data to users.  Users require these services through all levels of conflict in which they are capable of surviving.  DMSP consists of a space segment, link segment, ground segment, and user segment.  
Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. There are currently 6 operational DMSP satellites on orbit: two are designated primary, two are secondary, one is partially operational, and one is reserved for testing only.  The DMSP mission is expected to continue until 2019.  
The DMSP ground system network is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The ground segment consists of the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; AFSCN tracking stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA tracking stations in Fairbanks, AK, and Wallops, VA; user sites at AFWA, Omaha, NE, and FNMOC, at Monterey, CA.  Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  Future operational nodes may include McMurdo Ground Station, Antarctica, and the Svalsat Ground Station in Svalbard, Norway.


GROUND SEGMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Support for the ground system will include hardware and software component supply, repair, test, maintenance, upgrade, and technical support.  System upgrades, which include new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) components, shall be integrated into existing legacy systems in such a manner as to ensure requirements for timely and enduring data delivery are met.   Current software/OS consist of:  Open VMS, Windows NT/2000, Unix, Oracle, MS SQL, PVWAVE, EPOCH, and What’s Up Gold.  Programming languages consist of Fortran, C++, Ada, and PERL.  Network protocols consist of TCP/IP and DECNET.  

The Command Control and Communication (C3) system uses COTS and custom built hardware and software to provide satellite S-Band (2207.5—2252.5 MHz) command up-link and data down-link capability.  This includes equipment such as the Telemetry and Command System (TCS), Dual Decommutator and Command processor (DDCP), System Communications Unit (SCU), ARTS Interface Unit (AIU), Aiken Switch, and Data Quality Monitor (DQM).  The TCS is a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) platform running custom code that maintains satellite telemetry and command databases, generates satellite loads and commands, archives data and logs for engineering analysis, provides information for display on operations consoles and controls overall ground system function.    The DDCP is a custom designed device that provides decommutation and time-tagging of DMSP real-time and stored payload telemetry and outputs data via TCP/IP to the TCS via custom developed code.  It performs DMSP satellite command and load formatting, authentication, and echo check verification as well as provides KG control. Command and control, telemetry, and mission data up-link and down-link flows through cryptographic processors including KG-61 and KG-144.  The SCU is a custom designed device that provides point-to-point and broadcast inter-site communications via a TDM scheme and specialized formatting to ensure the reliable delivery of DMSP mission, telemetry, and commanding data between DMSP ground locations. The AIU is a modified, commercially available command processor that provides a direct interface with AFSCN tracking sites.  The Aiken Switch is a 20+ year old legacy component that provides switching and routing of DMSP DOMSAT links, SCUs, and TCS strings.  The input and output of all DMSP commanding and telemetry routes through and is controlled by the Aiken Switch.  DQM is a Windows XP based custom coded tool that allows users and operators to monitor data quality as it is down-linked.  DQM will provide the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) with a robust switching capability for multiple DOMSAT streams for its ingest processors.  The DMSP ground system network provides interconnectivity between all sites, users, and operations centers with TCP/IP based communications systems, DOMSAT links (3.2256 Mbps), and T1 connections.  The network is presently divided into three subsystems:  Communications, Switching, and Processing.  Many network components are integrated into more then one subsystem.  DMSP C3 support shall include in-depth comprehension of the DMSP C3 system, from operator interface to satellite command, control, and data recovery through to data receipt, quality monitoring, and ingest at AFWA and FNMOC.  DMSP C3 support will also include sustainment engineering for mission unique software, independent test analyses and problem isolation.  

The Government requires Level 1, 2, and 3 for depot level support on all operational and spare hardware.  The Government requires a ground segment mission reliability of 99.8%.  The ground segment operational availability rate will be 99.7% with a mean time between critical failures of the ground segment greater than 328 hours.  The mean time to repair the ground segment shall be less than 1 hour and the maximum corrective maintenance time of all repair actions shall not exceed 3 hours.  AFWA and FNMOC shall receive 100% of global smooth data within 10 minutes of downlink, and 100% of find data within 4 hours of downlink.  


SERVICES INFORMATION:

Required services will include technical support to all DMSP equipment at any site.  Technical support includes development, integration, and preventive and corrective maintenance. DMSP will need supply storage at a Contractor depot location for all depot items.  The Contractor shall furnish all facilities, parts, materials, data, equipment and services.  In order to meet the timely data delivery requirements, the Program will require on-call emergency technical support to any DMSP ground segment site, system engineering and analysis of ground segment equipment, configuration management, and feasibility studies for system enhancements and modifications.   The Program also requires sustaining engineering, system performance analysis, and test support.  Because of the use of legacy equipment, component and operational system modifications will be needed.  Modifications will include design, develop, fabricate, test, produce, manufacture, install modification kits and update all required technical documentation.  Support for the DMSP ground segment will include interaction and in-depth knowledge of the AFSCN, access to AFSCN sites, and support at AFSCN technical meetings.  DMSP support includes launch and early orbit support for DMSP spacecraft, providing ground system expertise and on-site support to the operations command center in Suitland MD.  Interaction with government and other contractors, as well as independent work, for launch and early orbit anomaly resolution related to the DMSP ground system will be required.  In addition, the contractor shall be able to send and receive equipment to CONUS and international locations, work with foreign governments and contractors to track, inventory, and/or transfer custody of equipment.  A SECRET clearance is necessary for this effort.  Services will include part-time availability of a knowledgeable engineer with access to Schriever AFB, CO, and a full-time engineer in Suitland, MD.  Engineering labor categories include software, system, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and quality assurance.  Other labor categories may include scientist, program management, administrative, and logistics.  DMSP requires investigating new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) technologies, and then testing and integrating these new acquisitions into the current system.  The Contractor will be expected to develop a long term system engineering and sustainment plan for DMSP C3 and provide the government with recommendations and milestones to sustain the ground network.  All hardware and software upgrades will meet the Department of Commerce’s Information Technology security requirements.   

Steps are near completion to begin replacement of the System Communications Units (SCUs) within the DMSP ground system.  These steps included tasks needed to identify, test, and demonstrate potential commercial equipment that can enable NOAA to potentially transform its data handling of DMSP bit stream data to an IP switched packet network.  It also included the associated design work to integrate the selected replacement device into the ground system with the least possible impact.  Work to procure, install, integrate and test the SCU replacement devices within the ground system will need to be started during this effort.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) intends to extend an existing contract with User Technology Associates/BAE Systems Co. for approximately 14 staff per year, effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2007, for a period of 12 months.  The basis for this extension is due to significant resource limitations at the NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) from November 2004 to the present time.

The NPOESS IPO provides the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to protect life, property and the environment, and to promote economic well being. Interested parties must respond in writing to Paula Frickey within 15 calendar days of the posted date of this Notice of Intent. TEXT OF MODIFICATION 2: In accordance with FAR 5.203(a) this Modification No. 2 to this Notice of Intent is to revise the response time from 45 calendar days to 15 calendar days. The response due date is hereby changed from April 17, 2006 to March 18, 2006.

<DESC>It is NOAA’s intent to negotiate a sole source contract with DATRON Advanced Technologies, Inc. for the replacement of the DATRON Model 1453-103A 13M Tracking Antenna Motor/Servo Control Systems at NOAA’s Command and Data Acquisition Stations located at Fairbanks, AK and Wallops Island, VA. The purpose of this synopsis is to perform a sources sought for the replacement of the DATRON Model 1453-103A 13M Tracking Antenna Motor/Servo Control Systems. It is NOAA’s belief that DATRON is the only source available to complete the necessary work in the time frames required to keep the 13M antenna systems operational on a 24 hour per day, seven day per week basis and minimize serious risk to the U.S Environmental Satellite program.  This upgrade shall include the replacement of four motors (two for the Azimuth axes, two for the Elevation axes) in each of the three DATRON 1453-103A 13M antenna systems at NOAA’s Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) and replacement of six motors (two for the Azimuth axes, two for the Elevation axes, and two third axis motors) at NOAA’s Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS).  Along with replacing the motors, the respective Azimuth and Elevation servo amplifiers shall be replaced in all FCDAS and WCDAS DATRON 1453-103A 13M antenna systems. The third axis servo motors are to be replaced at the WCDAS but not at the FCDAS. The Digital Electronics Unit (DEU) circuit boards in the Elevation servo assembly shall be removed, modified, and installed in a separate enclosed chassis that is to be located in the base of the antenna systems. All new interface cables shall be supplied to support this configuration/assembly.  In summary, the contractor will be required to replace and correspondingly modify all antenna systems drive motors; the motor’s respective servo amplifiers; all cable harnesses; all necessary modifications to the DEU (hardware, firmware, etc.); replace the antenna’s maintenance handheld controllers, and all other facets needed to perform a turnkey upgrade to the DATRON 1453-103A 13m antenna systems. Other facets shall include factory testing, shipment packaging to each site, site installation, site testing, antenna systems documentation and upgrade, management support and systems training. 

Questions concerning this acquisition shall be directed to Contracting Officer Paul Reed at Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov. All inquiries must be submitted in writing. Telephone inquiries will not be honored.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. (TBE), Huntsville, AL for an increase to the ceiling on the current TBE Contract DASG60-02-C-0051. The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii).  This action is to support a continuation of current efforts; specifically, the following critical Missile Defense Agency Ground Tests:  GTX-1a, GTX-1b, GTI-061, and  PATRIOT Interoperability Demonstration  Limited User Test (LUT). The support includes hardware integration, network interconnectivity, software tool development, interfaces and drivers, and Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Element Laboratory relat ed operations including test execution with the Joint National Integration Center (JNIC). The MDA test community has had and will continue to have a very aggressive schedule of experiments.  The test schedule in FY06 contains many tests and experiments req uiring continued development and support of the current MDSE team.  Any source other than TBE would result in unacceptable delays and cost burdens.  The processes currently being developed will continue to provide the means by which the community can acqui re the BMDS Block 4 Capabilities Assessment in a timely manner and insure that the MDA can meet the programmed milestones to declare a BMDS system capability mandated by Congress.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus award term inc entive contract.  The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned for the remainder of the basic five years of the MDSE contract not exceeding 23 April 2007.  The significant cost duplication that would be involved with a new firm is consid ered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), this action is directed toward Teledyne Brown Engineering.  This acquisition is not open t o foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to SMDC-RDCM-SS/Astrid Lahiere and must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of the publication of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract DASG60-02-C-0051 is not a request for compet itive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the pu rpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepte d.

<CONTACT>David E. Thomas  Contract Specialist  3039692166     David_Thomas@nps.gov ;
<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Architect -Engineering Services Contract with the design team lead by Paul Murdoch Architects, 5151 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 504, Los Angeles, CA 90036 to acquire the below listed services. 	The Flight 93 National Memorial Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-226) authorized a national memorial to "commemorate the passengers and crew of Flight 93 who, on September 11, 2001, courageously gave their lives thereby thwarting a planned attack on our Nation's Capital." The Act charges the Flight 93 Advisory Commission with developing recommendations for the planning, design, construction, and long-term management of a permanent memorial at the crash site and submitting those recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior by September 24, 2005. The National Park Service is responsible for the development and long-term stewardship of the memorial. 	The Commission and its other partners - the Families of Flight 93, the Flight 93 Memorial Task Force, and the National Park Service - agreed that a design competition open to everyone would be the most inclusive and democratic way to create a national memorial. 	The partners of the Flight 93 National Memorial conducted an international design competition to discover a design for the Flight 93 National Memorial.  The Partners collectively sponsored the Flight 93 National Memorial International Design Competition with $1 million in support from the Heinz Endowments and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. In the spring of 2004, the Families of Flight 93, a nonprofit organization, hired professional design competition advisors to help develop and administer an international competition to design the Flight 93 National Memorial.  	At the end of the grueling 6-month selection process, the jury's recommendation was forwarded to the Partners. Through this competition process, a design created by Paul Murdock Architects was selected as that which best embodies the Mission Statement as developed by the family members and the Partners.  All groups concurred with the recommendation which was then adopted by the Commission and announced publicly on September 7, 2005. The selected design represents the Preferred Design Alternative and the agency's preferred alternative in the General Management Plan.  	This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures of FAR 5.201 and 6.302.  The subsequent contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR 36.606 and FAR Part 15.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the "only one responsible source" as defined by FAR 6.302-01 (a)(2)(ii) for the required Architect-Engineering services.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services described below are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED:   The design team has completed the supplemental services stage for the memorial.  The design is currently in between the pre-design and schematic design stage.  For the purpose of this contract, the design team led by Paul Murdock Architects will be responsible for completing schematic design, design development, construction document preparation, and construction phase services. REQUIRED DISCIPLINES: Architecture,  Landscape Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural design/engineering and documentation services, surveying, HAZMAT testing, and acoustical design. Lighting design, geotechnical engineering, and Historical Architecture may be required.  Incidental services, e.g. CADD drafting and 3D modeling, word processing, cost estimating, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements. Firms believing they can provide the required services must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements via submission of Standard Form 330, Parts I and II.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 30 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 987-6646, Attention:  Dave Thomas.  Responses should include the completed SF 330 Parts I and II, the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number and identification of the firm's business size in accordance with the size standard. Title of Project: Design of the Flight 93 National Memorial Description:  The work of this proposed contract action consists of design for the Flight 93 National Memorial.      Type of Procurement: A sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract is anticipated.

The building’s concrete masonry units (CMU) do not meet current seismic criteria.  Reinforcement will be incorporated into existing CMU wall sections and will tie into the existing foundation and bond beams.  A similar upgrade technique, which utilizes steel flat bar shapes and wall fasteners, will be employed where unreinforced grout filled CMU wall construction or similar construction is encountered.  Additional shear walls (CMU and steel framed with plywood skin) will be constructed where new construction is provided and where it can strengthen the structure.  The existing roof system will be “X” braced along each exterior wall.
The new standing seam metal roof system design will utilize a performance type specification with contract and referenced as-built drawings.

Mechanical 
The new floor plan will necessitate the addition of new above ceiling water-source heat pump units and air distribution systems.  The existing condenser water pump, piping to well field, DDC head-end controls, sanitary sewer system (in part), and the domestic water system (in part) will be reutilized.  New plumbing fixtures will include water closets, urinals, lavatories, showers, and mop sinks.

Electrical

The building is served with secondary delivery voltage of 120/208V, 3 Phase.  New panels, wiring, and light fixtures will be provided.  The existing communications system will be reused with new telephone/data outlets added as required.  A complete addressable, supervised fire alarm system will be installed.

The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Y199, ConstructMisc Bldgs.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees. The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  A decision will be made to issue this solicitation as a competitive set-aside for 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or HubZone Small Business contractors or to issue an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition. The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  

A two-phase design-build selection procedure will be used.  Phase one shall include the scope of work, phase-one evaluation factors to include technical approach, technical qualifications, and past performance.  Phase two will require submission of technical and price proposals which will be evaluated separately.   

The contract will be for a term of five years consisting of one base year and four option years.  The estimated cost for this acquisition is between $55,000,000.00 and $60,000,000.00 for the five-year term of the contract.  Task orders will range from $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00.   

The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be five to ten pages, following the set format.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed projects within the last three years that are similar to the construction work and within the same dollar value magnitude (adjusted for inflation) of this notice.   Each reference shall include the company name and title, telephone number, and point of contact.  Provide evidence of sufficient available bonding capacity with the name of bonding company, telephone number, and point of contact.  Indicate whether your firm was the prime contractor or subcontractor on other similar projects.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify any Small Businesses (SBs), Non 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), SBA 8(a) Program Businesses, HubZone Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and/or Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs)  that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide technical support as described in the draft Statement of Work for the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs/Antimicrobials  Division (OPP/AD). EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) as required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996, institutes procedures for the registration of pesticides.  OPP develops data requirements and study guidelines that are used to assess the potential impact pesticides may have on human health and the environment.  Before using these data for regulatory purposes, OPP must evaluate the studies to determine their adequacy and to guarantee that appropriate quality assurance (QA) procedures were performed.   OPP also convenes workshops and seminars to discuss and resolve scientific issues related to the registration and re-registration of pesticides. Under Section 33 of FIFRA (as added by subsection (f)(2) of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003), the EPA will collect fees from registrants to register their pesticide chemical for review.  The benefit of this Fee is to guarantee the registrant that the time frame for registering their chemical will be reduced. 	As a result of the new FIFRA amendments the Antimicrobials Division (AD) was created in 1997.  The division was assigned the task of assisting in the reduction of antimicrobial pesticide registration and re-registration backlog.  With the new amendments the AD was given the authority to regulate the sale, distribution and use of antimicrobial pesticides.  All antimicrobial pesticides must be registered by EPA before they may be imported, sold or distributed in the U.S. Registered uses include disinfectants, slimicides, algaecides and sanitizers.  As new products and new protocols emerge, the onus is on the Agency to develop novel testing strategies and methods that stimulates the most ideal use environments.        The objectives of this potential contract are to: -	Provide a resource for statistical analysis and rationale for testing protocols, research                      reports, and efficacy data that is reviewed by the EPA for product registration and re-             registration.  The analysis will determine if the prescribe method design, work performed,              and the conclusions reached are statistically valid and complete.  Some registration              projects will require independent analysis of raw data.  	-	To assist the Antimicrobials Division (AD) in the establishment of quantitative  performance standards having specified decision error rates.  By assisting in the generation of quantitative analysis, the Contractor will assist AD in partitioning the steps involved in setting performance standards into those based on scientific knowledge and those that require policy decisions.   	-	To initiate and test in vitro applications for which methodology and performance standards have not been generated by EPA.  Through analysis of raw data and methods, novel test protocols can be implemented, allowing for effective product registration. -	Perform special assignments as they relate to emerging, re-emerging, and unresolved issues in the AD. Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) which will be posted to the following web-page on or about March 08,2006:      http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0613760/index.htm     The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690 with a size standard of $6.5 million for potential socioeconomic program businesses.  The current contract is 68-W-02-050 with an approximate maximum value of $850,000 over a four year period ending 30 September 2006 with Montana State University as the incumbent.   The potential contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Performance Based Service  type with a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods with a maximum estimated cost of approximately $875,000. Any interested small business concerns are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section I Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a small business set-aside contract for services "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."  Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.  Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested socioeconomic program concerns who believe they have the capability of providing services as defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, a Capabilities Statement with sufficient information within the 10 page limitation.  Responses shall demonstrate capabilities/expertise with consideration to the SOW requirements.

One strategy in this overarching initiative is collecting enroute barcode scans from mail bar-coded with USPS value added services such as Delivery Confirmation™ and Signature Confirmation™. The Small Parcel Bundle Sorter (SPBS) is legacy mail processing equipment technology used for sorting small parcels and bundles. SPBS transport Parcels on Carrier Cells. The Track & Trace Scanner (TATS) solution will be mounted to the SPBS equipment in the “recentering area” of the SPBS sorter and will read and report value-added service barcode scans from mail sorted by the SPBS. The technology source must not only be capable of meeting the barcode reading technology requirements described herein but must also be capable of designing the complete TATS mounting solution assembly equipped with status indicator lights for the SPBS application, assembling and distributing complete TATS installation kits to USPS locations with SPBS, and producing a Technical Data Package, solution handbook, and instructional DVD. 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: 1. The barcode reader solution shall at a minimum read the following barcode symbologies: USS Code Interleaved 2 of 5, USS Code 128 (all subsets), UCC/EAN 128, and USS Code 39 (USS Code 3 of 9). 2. The solution must read at the accuracy level specified for all the symbologies referenced above at the minimum allowable printing standards permitted by USPS publications. These publications include USPS Publication 91, DMM S918, DMM S19, and USPS Publication 97. Minimum barcode standards include but are not restricted to ANSII Code Quality ratings of A, B, or C, narrow bars or spaces as little as 0.013 inch (this minimum must be readable at all depths of field), and a minimum white space reflectance (Rs) as low as 50 percent when measured in the red spectral range between 630 nanometers and 675 nanometers and a maximum bar reflectance (Rb) as high as 25 percent. 3. Scan coverage must span the top of the parcel as well as up to a 45 degree angle decline on all four sides from the top of the parcel when the parcel surface is oriented parallel to the Carrier Cell. Barcode read rate on the top of the parcel must meet or exceed 99 percent. Barcode read rate on the 45 degree angle must meet or exceed 95 percent. 4. The solution shall read parcels with a minimum size of 2.5” x 2.5” x 0.1“and a maximum size of 12” x 15” x 12”. 5. The distance between the Barcode Reader and the Carrier Cell shall be a minimum of 4 feet. 6. The barcode reader shall read the symbologies specified at the quality and accuracy levels specified in a SPBS Carrier Cell speed range of 250 to 350 ft/min in conjunction with the Carrier Cell specifications listed below. If the barcode reader requires adjusting to achieve the required read rates at the speed range specified the vendor shall provide an optical sensor (or similar apparatus) mounted in proximity to the Barcode reader to detect the speed of the SPBS Carrier Cell. In addition to prompting barcode reader adjustments the cell speed sensing apparatus must alert the scanner to go into safe mode when the SPBS is not in operation. The SPBS has two speed settings measuring approximately 273 fpm and 343 fpm. SPBS carrier cells are 15.5” wide with a 22.2” pitch. There is a 2” Separation between carrier cells. 7. The Barcode Reader shall not transmit duplicate barcode strings for a single Special Service label pass through the barcode reading zone. 8. The barcode reader shall report the decoded barcode data via RS-232 interface with the following RS-232 parameters: Baud rate = 19200, Data Bits = 8, Parity = None, Stop Bits = 1 and Flow Control = NONE. 9. In the case of a laser-based solution the scanner shall be a Food and Drug Administration Class 1, 2, or 2A device under 21 CFR 1040.10, or Class 1, 1M, and 2 under International Electrotechnical Commission Standard 60825-1.  FDA Classes 3A, 3B, and 4 or IEC Classes 2M, 3M, 3R, and 4 shall not be used as barcode scanners for this application. The scanning solution configuration and/or design shall allow for limiting the scanner beam path from extending beyond the immediate perimeter of the processing equipment into potentially occupied spaces. 10. The barcode reading solution shall allow for pre-configuration of calibration settings tailored to this application. 11. The barcode reader solution components shall be capable of use in industrial, hazardous, and dust-filled environments. 12. The Barcode Reader and associated equipment must operate while exposed to 90% non-condensing relative humidity at 122°F and operate in an ambient temperature range of -40°F to 100°F. 13. The Barcode Reader will be subject to vibration during use and shall operate without compromised integrity, calibration, or functionality for the life of the warranty and for the length of the required calibration interval. 14. The Barcode Reader and associated equipment shall operate without compromised integrity or functionality in a dust-filled environment.

SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES: For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide performance data for available systems for USPS review. This information should include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor’s ability to meet the requirements in this specification. This written information shall be provided no later than March 31, 2006. Minor variations to the values expressed within the above specification will be considered by the USPS if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications. In the event that a potential vendor is currently has or plans to develop a system which will meet the requirements provided herein, such vendor must provide a date by April 03 2006 when those development activities would be completed and their system be available for USPS review. Following USPS review of the submitted system performance data, pre-qualification determination will be made and competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished. The prequalified suppliers are firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards. The USPS will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements. Interested parties of this sources sought are to submit a total of two copies (one hard copy and one soft copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs, technology performance specifications, and operations manuals of equipment that meets or exceeds these specifications and requirements to the address provided in this announcement. Overly elaborate responses are neither expected nor required. The USPS by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to acquisition of any barcode reading technology.

<DESC>Request for Information JTRS Software Internet Controller Application March 7, 2006 1.0     DESCRIPTION The Army Contract Agency, Information Technology, E-Commerce, and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), in support of the Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) Joint Waveforms Program Office (JWPO), is seeking information from interested parties on how the  JTRS program can address communications and interoperability requirements of and strategies for the acquisition of a Software Internet Controller (SoftINC) that: "	complies to the Armys INC SRS version 3.10 (4 May 2005), which corresponds to version 6.2 of the legacy INC implementation, "	complies to JTRS SCA version 2.2.1, "	meets the requirements of MIL-STD-188-220C, and "	meets current JTRS Information Assurance requirements, including applicable requirements from the 1 Dec 2005 version of the JTRS Unified Infosec Criteria (UIC). This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   Responses to this notice shall not be construed as offers and cannot be accepted by the G overnment to form a binding contract.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not re sponding to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued. Release of reference technical documentation is limited to United States corporations and United States citizens.    2.0     BACKGROUND The Department of Defense established the JTRS program to provide a family of software programmable radios designed around a Software Communications Architecture (SCA).  As such, the JTRS will provide reliable multi-channel voice, data, imagery, and video communications and eliminate communications problems caused by stovepipe legacy systems.  The JTRS will achieve these objectives through the procurement and fielding of a digital, programmable, modular communication system based on software-defined radio t echnology. JTRS will provide interoperability through the capacity to communicate with current tactical communications systems in the near term.  In the future, JTRS will provide integrated information sharing through new waveforms to support joint operations.  This interoperability will help meet the demands of U.S. Military forces and, when needed, communications with other government entities and first responders. As part of this initiative, the JTRS program is evaluating the means by which they can establish a SoftINC capability within this family of communications products.  The JTRS SoftINC will perform IP Routing between the SINCGARS radio nets; EPLRS radios net s, external host computers, commercial routes and other networks.  The SoftINC application as implemented by the JTRS program will be a software controlled data router that contains the UDP/TCP/IP protocol stack as well as specializes agent that provide th e routing of IP data and Situational Awareness (SA) packets through the Armys Lower Tactical Internet (TI).  The SoftINC will also contain MIL-STD-188-220D link layer protocol to support networking over SINCGARS. This RFI is to solicit industrys views on the state of the software based internet controllers, provide insight into methodologies for developing a JTRS SoftINC capability that will be interoperable with non-DoD SoftINC standard devices, and comment on is sues that could affect the affordability of the JTRS SoftINC waveform.  3.0     REQUESTED INFORMATION This RFI requests information from industry regarding the JTRS SoftINC application requirements as well as information regarding possible acquisition strategies.  The questions below provide a starting point for information input. 3.1          Are there any existing technologies/products that could satisfy the JTRS SoftINC req uirements?  Please quantify and explain any required modifications where possible. 3.2          Are the current APIs as defined for the SCA and SoftINC sufficient to produce and field a fully interoperable SoftINC capability?  If not, what are the issues? 3.3          What are the projected technology trends that will support SoftINC?  3.4          Are there any critical issues associated with integrating SoftINC capabilities onto handheld/small form factor sets? 3.5          How can current industry life cycle support to SoftINC products be leveraged to support the JTRS SoftINC? 3.6          Which requirements would drive cost/schedule for a SoftINC application development? 3.7          What acquisition strategies may be available that could reduce implementation technical, schedule, and/or cost risk? 3.8          Are there any issues with implementation of MIL-STD-188-220D vice MIL-STD-188-220C? 4.0     TECHNICAL REFERENCES.

The Contractor shall mount an HG1700-AG58 unit on this base unit within a PC-104 frame of minimum height.  The Contractor shall mount the IMU to the base plate with the IMU axes aligned with the base plate axes.  If alignment cannot be performed to within 0.01 degrees, the alignment error must be measured and reported for each unit.

2.3  Interface Unit (IU) Requirements

The IU shall be designed to perform without failure under a normal industrial temperate range.  The IU shall include conformal coating, shall accept a TTL-level-1 Hz timing signal which it shall use for timing purposes and also feed to a selectable IRQ on the PC-104 bus.  The IU shall include an interface to the HG1700-AG58 IMU for the purposes of providing unit power and collecting measurements, shall include a general-use RS-422 asynchronous serial port that is accessible through the PC-104 bus and able to share an interrupt line with other ports, shall accept Type 1 and Type 2 messages from the IMU, shall time-tag the measurements with fractions of second to an accuracy of 1 microsecond and shall include a bus-level interface to provide measurement and timing information to a GFE computer in the PC-104 stack.  This can be either I/O mapped or memory mapped and shall be selectable.  The IU shall provide a bus interrupt when a complete IMU data message is available and  the interrupt shall be selectable by jumpers.  The Contractor shall provide the cable between the IU and the IMU.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Lenses, Ophthalmic, Manufacturing
<DESC>BILLING CODE: 8025-01

U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Lenses, Ophthalmic, Manufacturing.  
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Lenses, Ophthalmic, Manufacturing.  According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith Butler, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.§ 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR §121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR §121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Lenses, Ophthalmic, Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 339115.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
HIGH-ENERGY FIBER LASER AND AMPLIFIERS


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to engage in cooperative research to develop and commercialize new fiber laser technology.

Background:	LLNL is an acknowledged leader in the design and fabrication of short-pulse high-energy lasers, and in recent years has devoted considerable effort to developing versions of these that take advantage of optical fiber technologies.  Such lasers are more robust and efficient than their bulk-optic predecessors, though the fiber damage threshold tends to limit their output pulse energies.  LLNL has designed fibers having large effective areas to mitigate the damage issue, and is currently developing new high energy fiber lasers and amplifiers based on their techniques. 

Description:	LLNL is seeking to jointly research and develop for commercialization both high-energy lasers and amplifiers based on their optical fiber designs.   The Researchers are currently testing fiber-based amplifiers that can create and sustain nanosecond-scale pulses having energies up to 1.0 mJ and plan to scale to 10 mJ pulses in the future.

Development Status:  LLNL currently has prototype designs for novel high-energy fibers and novel high-energy fiber amplifiers, both for 938nm and 1080nm, which LLNL can demonstrate to an interested industry partner.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.

<SUBJECT>D -- SBInet Advisory Multi-Step Process
<DESC>Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the Department of Homeland Security, Customs & Border Protection’s (CBP) SBInet – Advisory Multi-Step Process.

Customs and Border Protection intends to issue a Request for Proposal that may result in the award of an indefinite deliver/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This contract is to provide services, products and management needed to ensure accomplishment of the CBP SBInet Initiative, to achieve border control through the optimum mix of staffing, infrastructure and technology.  The focus of SBInet is securing the land borders at and between the Ports of Entry (POEs) of the United States of America and establishing a Common Operational Picture (COP) within DHS.  The Solicitation/Request for Proposal number has not yet been assigned.  All documents applicable to this special notice will be available via the Internet at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/contrtact/sbi_net/.  
 
Interested parties are invited to respond to this Special Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.  This method also correlates with use of a Statement of Objectives for performance-based support under a single integration support contract for CBP’s multi-year SBInet Program.  Telephone requests for this Special Notice cannot be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1 of the Advisory Multi-Step Process, described below.  The anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) (Phase 2) release date is March 31, 2006.  Please ensure the reference number and program title (U.S. Customs & Border Protection – Secure Border Initiative, SBInet) is referenced on all correspondence.  


ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS: 
This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.  Phase 1 consists of the submission of Vendor Capability Statements, agency evaluations of the capability statements, and subsequent advisory notifications to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.  To preserve the integrity of the on-going solicitation, the government will not entertain any phone calls, emails, questions, or communication of any kind during this phase.  Phase 2 consists of the solicitation, proposal evaluation, and award.

Phase 1 – Submission of Vendor Capability Statements, Agency Evaluations and Advisory Notifications  
This phase includes submissions of Vendor Capability Statements the SBInet Relevant Experience Questionnaire, followed by CBP’s assessment and the advisory notifications.  

A. Submission of Vendor Capability Statements:
Interested vendors are invited to submit Capability Statements describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements and the accompanying Relevant Experience Questionnaire forms must be submitted via email to SBInet@dhs.gov no later than Tuesday, March 14, 2006, 9:00 am EST.  Please ensure the RFP number and program title (U.S. Customs & Border Protection – Secure Border Initiative, SBInet) is referenced in the subject line of the email.  

Responding to a performance-based solicitation, especially one utilizing a SOO that seeks contractor-developed solutions requires a significant effort on the part of contractors to propose to the government.  It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the agency's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches and solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the agency’s intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solution thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this performance-based contract award are asked to carefully review the attached SBInet Program Background, and Capability Statements and Criteria documents to make a realistic self-assessment as to their potential viability.  

B.  Agency Evaluations:
The Vendor Capability Statements will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statements Instructions below.  The agency will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the vendors who provide submissions.  There will be no opportunity for questions during this phase.  

C.  Advisory Notifications:
CPB will issue advisory notifications stating that the respondent will either be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or, based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  As explained in FAR 15.202(b), Advisory Multi-Step Process, “….The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.”

Phase 2 – Solicitation, Proposal Evaluation and Award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract 
This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed technical and cost proposals, management plans, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify initial (or possibly sample) tasks to be completed by the selected offeror following contract award.  To ensure that the government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors will be provided an opportunity to participate in a “due diligence” period where prospective offerors meet with key agency representatives to learn as much as possible about the SBInet program, mission goals, and requirements in order to develop a competitive solution.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-22 - Wireless Adaptable Network Node (WANN) Proposer's Day
<DESC>SN06-22 - PROPOSER'S DAY CONFERENCE

DARPA will host a Proposer's Day Conference in support of the Wireless Adaptable Network Node (WANN) effort on March 16th, 2006 at George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, 3401 North Fairfax Drive, Room 239, Arlington, VA; beginning at 8AM and lasting until noon.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the BAA 06-26, Wireless Adaptable Network Node (WANN), promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

WANN is part of a larger effort to develop and demonstrate technologies and system concepts that will enable intelligent adaptive wireless networks consisting of densely deployed low-cost wireless nodes.  The premise is that significant advantages can be realized by densely deploying low-cost nodes that have been jointly optimized with network operations.  WANN networks should adapt to changing conditions by adjusting the topology of the network and the operational mode of the nodes to reduce the demands on the nodes, in particular on the physical and link layers.  By working around the limitations of the low-cost nodes that form the network, and by utilizing the rich interconnection fabric created by dense deployment, the WANN network should provide reliable and highly available battlefield communications at a low system cost.

Previous practice has been to build high cost and hence sparsely deployed nodes, and to organize the network around these nodes.  This program aims to shift the approach used to design military wireless networks from design for radio range to design for node density.

The larger effort consists of two program elements, the Wireless Adaptable Network Node  (WANN) effort and a future Network Development effort.  The two efforts will develop and demonstrate Mobile ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) architecture and technologies comprising: 

1.	Low-cost multi-channel spectrum-agile MIMO-capable wireless nodes using inexpensive RF circuit technology (WANN)  
2.	A mesh network with densely deployed low-cost wireless nodes and an adaptive network layer that mitigates the shortcomings of those nodes by leveraging the density of the mesh.  (Future effort).

The result will be a novel MANET that is both inexpensive and high-performance.  In particular, the throughput and reliability of the communications at each node should significantly improve on today’s capabilities.

As currently defined, the WANN Wireless Node Development effort will cover all four phases of node development:  design, development & small-scale demonstration, medium-scale demonstration, and large-scale demonstration.  DARPA plans to solicit proposals for all four phases of the WANN Wireless Node Development effort with the forthcoming BAA. 

The design of the WANN wireless nodes should be based on an RF processing circuit that can be replicated to dynamically support a variety of network radio capabilities.  The capabilities that should be dynamically adaptable include, but are not limited to the following:  MIMO, spectrum agility (location and bandwidth), modulation, data rate, multiple-channel beam-forming, and nulling.  The wireless node design should be traceable to an expected large quantity (initial buy only) procurement cost to the Government that is sustainable throughout the life-cycle of the system at no more than $500 per unit (initial large buy and follow-on variable size buys).

The overall program concept and specific objectives of each phase will be presented at the Proposers’ Day meeting.

DARPA anticipates that the Wireless Adaptable Network Node effort will be unclassified.

The meeting will be open to the public.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

”Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

The dimensions of the conveyor should be as follows:  40ft x 20ft, with a 3ft moving belt, and no higher than 20-21 inches from the ground.  As safety of the canine trainees is of paramount importance, the conveyor must also have additional safety features such as emergency start-stop features with visual and audible alarms, and multiple control stations.

Award will be made based on the offer considered to provide the best value to the Government, technical factors and price included.

	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.

Management must be effective with flexible and responsive staffing with no performance problems or deficiencies that impact task quality, time or cost.  Vendor must meet all requirements in overall satisfaction to end-users.
