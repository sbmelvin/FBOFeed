<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 04-13 Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN); CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of its publication in www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS: 9 July 2004;  POC: Preston Marshall, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA04-13@darpa.mil;  Web:  www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/DTN/index.htm
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the development and demonstration of key technologies based on several "problem areas" in the implementation of DTN.  The Disruption Tolerant Networking program will develop and demonstrate technology that will provide network services when no end-to-end path exists through the network, and additional network behavior and functionality required as DoD transitions from conventional networks to more dynamic, self-forming, peer to peer architectures, such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETS).  This program builds on work previously performed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Delay Tolerant Networking Research program (http://www.dtnrg.org).  The DARPA DTN program?s goal is to provide delay tolerance by organizing information flow into bundles. These bundles are to be routed through an "intelligent" network that can manage the delivery of the bundles to the maximal extent permitted by the available topology.  This method will allow messages to pass through the network with successive responsibilities, rather than the traditional end-to-end scheme. In the DARPA DTN program, features appropriate to military use of the Delay Tolerant mechanism will be researched.

This BAA requests proposals for Phase 1 "only" of a potential 3 phase program.  There may be subsequent BAA(s) to address Phase 2 and 3, but the Government is under no obligation to issue any subsequent BAA(s) to this solicitation.  

Phase 1 will focus on the development and demonstration of key technologies based on several "problem areas" in the implementation of DTN and evolution into the capabilities of a disruption tolerant network.  Phase 2, is anticipated to address the integration of the phase 1 technologies into a single framework that meets military needs.  Phase 3 is anticipated to consist of experiments and demonstrations of the integrated DTN system.  Progression through the program will be based on successful completion of the program metrics as indicated in the BAA and future solicitation activities. 

In Phase 1, the Government anticipates from one to three awards in three "problem areas" of fuzzy delivery scheduling, policy-based resource planning and utilization, and late binding.  These areas are described in the BAA.  The Government desires to award the optimum combination of proposals, which offers the best overall value to the Government.  DARPA reserves the right to fund some, all, or none of the proposals submitted under this BAA.  Further, DARPA may choose to select for negotiation all of a given proposal, or selected portions thereof. 

PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE:  A Proposers Day Conference was held on January 21, 2004 to provide additional information, discussion, and to facilitate teaming on this topic.  Proposers Day information will be posted to http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/DTN/index.htm for proposer review.  NOTE:  It was not mandatory to attend the Proposers Day Conference to respond to this BAA. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated on their general merit, compliance with program requirements, and other factors listed below.  In order of importance, the proposal Evaluation Criteria includes: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Management Approach; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission; and (d) Cost Realism. 

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet that provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.  The pamphlet is available at http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/DTN/index.htm and  http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  In the event of any conflict between what is posted at http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/DTN/index.htm  and http://www.fedbizopps.gov, the information posted at http://www.fedbizopps.gov shall take precedence.

Request for Equitable Adjustment or  Extraordinary Relief Due to Changed Revenue in APF Commercial Travel Contracts.  
(a)	The contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting officer, in writing, of 
unanticipated changes in the conditions of commercial travel office revenues and expenses that may affect contract performance.

(b)	 If unanticipated changes in the commercial travel industry significantly increase
of decrease the level of the Contractor’s revenue and/or profits under the contract, then
the Contractor may submit to the Contracting Officer a proposal requesting equitable adjustment of the contract terms.  The proposal must fully explain the advantages of, disadvantages of and rationale for various alternatives for possible relief.  The proposal must also explain why the Contractor did not anticipate the change and describe the ways in which the Contractor thinks the change will degrade contract performance.  The proposal must describe in detail the actions the Contractor is taking to mitigate its alleged losses, such as reengineering its own organization and business practices and taking actions against the commission sources.  If the Contractor is requesting relief that includes a reduction in discount, then the proposal must identify the anticipated dollar amount of effect on the Government (resulting increase in the ultimate cost of travel or other services), for purposes of helping the Contracting Officer determine who has cognizance over a request of this dollar magnitude and adequacy of any legal consideration the Contractor is offering to support the requested change.  If the Contractor is not offering adequate consideration, then the Contractor must describe why and how national security will be affected if the requested adjustment is not granted, and must contain information in the format set out in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 50.

(a)	In order to be considered the Contractor’s proposal must be properly certified in accordance with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2410(a).  This certification requires full disclosure of all relevant facts, including:
	
	(1).  cost or pricing data if required in accordance with FAR 15.403-4 or by the Contracting Officer

	(2).  information other than cost or pricing data, in accordance with FAR 15.403-3, including actual cost data and data to support any estimated costs, even if cost or pricing data are not required, and 

	(3).  a  thorough explanation of how the actual or estimated dollar amount and percentage reduction was determined.

	(d) If the parties can agree on adequate consideration, then the parties may mutually agree on a written contract modification to implement the agreed adjustment.

	(e) If there is not mutual agreement on adequate consideration, and if the agency official who is authorized to approve requests for extraordinary relief finds, in his or her sole discretion, that there is adequate justification to show that the Contractor could not have anticipated the changed circumstance and did not include it in the preparation of the offer that resulted in the contract, and that the changed circumstance threatens national security through undermined contract performance (quality and price of services), then that official may unilaterally grant equitable relief as that official deems appropriate.

	(f) There is no requirement that the Government must make up, in whole or in part, the loss in revenue the Contractor allegedly experiences as a result of the changed circumstances in the travel industry.

	(g) If the conditions that resulted in the requested equitable adjustment should change again within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the contract modification implementing the adjustment, then the Contracting Officer shall have the sole discretion to reinstate the original terms of the contract.

(h) Regardless of whether the Contractor gives notice under (a) or submits a proposal under (b), above, if changes in the travel industry or in the method and amount of compensation of the Contractor (through commissions and other methods) result in an increase in revenue stream to the Contractor, then the Contracting Officer shall unilaterally modify the contract to increase the amount of discount and thereby decrease the cost of official travel for the Government

 Any questions regarding this notice should be directed to Robert Hough (509) 247-4873 or e-mail at robert.hough@fairchild.af.mil. Quote is due 8 Jun 2004; NLT 4:30 p.m. PDT.  Anticipated award date is 14 Jun 2004.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The Bureau of Land Management intends to award a firm fixed-price contract for a customized Oil and Gas Stakeholders workshop. The development of federal oil and gas resources in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico presents numerous challenges on split estate, where private individuals own the surface and the federal government owns and leases development rights to the private industry to extract natural gas.  With the increase in well density resulting from the downspacing of the Fruitland Coal Formation from 320 acres to 160 acres, the Farmington Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management is aware of increasing conflicts associated with the siting of wells on split estate.  Early in Fiscal Year 2004, the Bureau of Land Management issued revised instructions to the field with regard to the process to involve private surface owners in the development of the federal mineral estate.  This change has not been widely publicized or understood by many of the critics of BLM's oil and gas program in the San Juan Basin.  The FFO proposes to hold a one day workshop on Saturday, July 24, 2004 between the hours of 9am to 5pm with a one-hour break for lunch.  Up to 125 individuals may attend.  The workshop will be held at San Juan College in Farmington, New Mexico to educate surface stakeholders on the following topics: 	History of split estate  	Legal rights of surface and mineral owners/lessees 	BLM Policy on Split Estate 	Becoming proactively involved in the well development process 	Basic Geology of the San Juan Basin 	Effective Communication Strategies 	Exploring potential impacts to air and water quality                 Resources available through the State, County and City 	Basic Noxious Weed Awareness The training, to be presented in Farmington, shall be customized to address the peculiarities of New Mexico State, County and local ordinances and regulations.  By educating stakeholders and interested members of the public on the process used to develop the federal mineral estate, we can reduce the level of conflict and controversy. Vendor shall provide workshop information to attendees in the form of workshop binders.  In addition to the binders, vendor shall also provide all supporting handouts necessary to educate stakeholders.  Both shall be provided in sufficient copies for all registered attendees plus 20% additional quantity to accommodate late registrants.  Vendors overall responsibility is to prepare workshop materials, coordinate final edits with BLM, execute workshop using approved materials.  BLM will advertise the workshop to the public and register attendees for the workshop.  BLM will make the workshop location available to vendor one hour before and one hour after the workshop for set-up and clean-up of materials and equipment.  The Government shall retain all rights in data for materials developed and presented at the workshop.   At time of contract award, vendor will be required to execute a statement indicating they have no personal or organizational conflict of interest in development or performance of the workshop.  Vendor shall include in presentation a statement to clarify that vendor is under contract to the US government and is not a federal employee.  BLM will provide needed audio-visual equipment, including podium, microphone, overhead projector, and laptop/powerpoint projection capability.  Vendor shall provide a fixed price quote for development and presentation of the workshop based on each of 40, 80, or 125 attendees, plus the per binder cost of additional binders if notified of late registrants within two days prior to the workshop.  All travel, per diem, and/or lodging costs shall be included in vendor's quote for the workshop. Deliverables: 1) Draft workshop binder and presentations (2 paper copies and 1 electronic copy) 2) Final workshop binder and presentations, as follows: - Binder quantity to equal # of registered attendees as of 19 July 2004, plus 20% additional binders to accommodate late registrants plus electronic copy of planned presentations,  - One copy of binder and all presentations as "file copy" for BLM. - Electronic copy of binder materials and all presentations. Proposed schedule: 6 July 2004, 9am:  Vendor delivers drafts of workshop binder and presentations to BLM. 12 July 2004, NLT 4pm:  BLM returns final edits on workshop binder and presentations to vendor.  Edits may be hand-written or electronic. 19 July 2004, NLT 4pm: BLM notification to vendor of number of attendees. 24 July 2004: Vendor delivers workshop and materials at BLM Oil and Gas Stakeholders Workshop. Vendors wishing to provide a quote must include the following with pricing information: Development and Presentation of workshop - $ Based on 40 attendees:  $ Based on 80 attendees:  $ Based on 125 attendees:  $ Binders, each, for late registrants:  $ As part of your quote, potential vendors shall provide a summary of their relevant experience developing and presenting similar workshops within the past 3 years to include syllabus or table of contents from similar efforts, education and credentials applicable to this effort, and current information on at least 3 past performance references.

Small business participation:  Although this procurement is open to large business, small, small women owned, small disadvantaged, Section 8(a), Service-disabled Veteran, and HUBZone small business firms are strongly encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in construction of Federal facilities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
				2100 Second Street, SW
				Washington, D.C. 20593
				Telephone:   (202) 267-2285

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-04-R-6F9007 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN): CLIN 0001 Propane refueling-Two sites; Total Quantity 3,400 gallons.  The locations are: 1) Naked Island, 2,300 gallons; 2) Point Pigot, 1,100 gallons.  CLIN 0002 Propane refueling-Seven sites; Total Quantity 6,800 gallons. The locations are: 1) Robert Barron, 2,200 gallons; 2) Duke Island, 800 gallons; 3) Sukkwan Island, 800 gallons; 4) Cape Fanshaw, 700 gallons; 5) Zarembo Island, 700 gallons; 6) Mt. Mac Arther, 700 gallons; 7) Althorp Peak, 900 gallons.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The Contractor shall re-fuel two Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Valdez area and seven Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Juneau area.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the permanent site-standard (five) 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.
START OF WORK:  Work shall not start before 1 August 2004.
DELIVERY: Services shall be completed for all sites, except Robert Barron, not later than 30 September 2004.  The Robert Barron site shall be refueled no later than 30 August 2004. 
AWARD:  This purchase will be based on the following criteria:  Past performance and technical capability will be evaluated.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for the effort required to conduct Power Harmonics Risk Mitigation Testing between the SSGN Power System and the Tomahawk Block III AUR AC/DC Converters.  The tasking associated with this effort includes, but is not limited to, the systems engineering and systems test efforts required for SSGN Power Harmonics Test planning, execution, analysis, and reporting phases.  This effort also includes the development of a Power Harmonics Test Procedure and a Power Harmonics Test Report.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely posesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this effort, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing these requirements in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number N00019-04-R-0148 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22 & 23 effective 5 May 2004.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  This is not a small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 336413.  The contract line item numbers are:  CLIN  0001  Extended Cargo Rail System for V-22 (Qty: 2 shipsets).  Development, fabrication, and delivery of two ship sets of an Extended Cargo Rail system for test and evaluation.  Drawing packages of the ramp attachment channel will be provided upon request.  Options:  CLIN 0002: - drawings, CLIN 0003:  2 ship sets of external cargo rails (for testing).  Non-developmental (NDI) equipment is highly desired.  1)  General Requirements:  a)  The cargo rails are mission equipment and will be carried in the aircraft.  No stowage provisions are required.  b)  The cargo rails should mount to the aircraft ramp using a means similar to that of the H-46 cargo system (drawings provided upon request).  c)  Designs shall not require Group A changes (e.g. aircraft attachment locations and methods, aircraft structural load paths).  d)  The system shall be capable of carrying up to 5,000 lbs over an 88-inch running length.  e)  Special attention shall be given to minimize the weight, need for hand tools, handling requirements of the system. f)  Workmanship shall be in accordance with high-grade aircraft practice and of quality to insure maximum safety, proper operations, and design service life.  2)  Basic Roller Rail Extension Requirements:  Extensions shall have the capability of accepting a wooden warehouse pallet loaded on non-contiguous runner boards.  a) The spacing between individual rollers shall take into account the actual versus nominal non-contiguous runner spacing for typical 40x48 wooden warehouse pallets.  A four-inch center to center would be preferred.  b)  Extensions shall be manufactured from lightweight material capable of holding up to 5000 lbs of cargo spread over a running length of 88 inches or 2500 lbs spread over the non-contiguous runners of the 40x48 pallet.  c)  Extensions roller material shall provide smooth movement of the pallet load with minimal amount of human force to push the pallet in the event the winch is unavailable.  Roller material and type that are current installed on the V-22’s new cargo handling system (Aircraft 19 and subsequent) are preferred (aluminum crown barrel bearing rollers).  d)  The extensions shall integrate a fully adjustable “flip-up” style pallet guides.  Minimally the adjustment, per side should be a 7 –inch adjustment in 1-inch increments.  Total adjustability is from 40 inches to 54 inches wide.  e)  Extensions shall be stabilized with the use of  “spreader” type bars, which, when locked in place, restrict movement laterally.  Spreader bar locations shall allow for an 88-inch long pallet to be loaded with a forklift directly onto the extensions without interference of the bars on the forklift tines.  The “spreader” type bars shall be integral to the rails to reduce the opportunity for lost equipment.  f)  Removable ramp interface brackets with a design similar to those of the H-46 system shall be used in the design of the rail system.  Upon attachment into the V-22 ramp, the extensions shall lock in place for positive restriction of movement in all directions.  g)  The extensions shall be nineteen feet in length.  3)  Specific Roller Rail Extension Requirements:  a)  Cargo Ramp Roller Rail Extensions shall utilize interlocking means to prevent misalignment of attachment to the ramp.  b)  Mechanical Lock Pins can be used (although not desired) where necessary to minimize the need for hand tools, special tools or procedures.  c)  Since the extensions will be used in an austere environment the ability to quickly disengage extensions from the ramp is also desired.  d)  Each extension shall provide three tiedown ring locations, one forward, one aft and one approximately mid-span, for fastening of the beam to the aircraft floor during flight.  e)  All labeling of installation locations shall be etched and painted.  Labeling of spreader bar adjustment locations should be provided to ensure concordance with ramp mounting locations.  4)  Priced Options:- a)  Priced option for drawings  b)  Priced option for 2 ship sets of external cargo rails (for testing).  The contractor shall deliver CLIN 0001 with all standard commercial support documentation and equipment manuals no later than 30 August 2004 to the following address:  Hangar 109 Suite 2A, 22474 James Rd., Patuxent River, MD 20670 Attn: Mark Schroeder.  Inspection and acceptance shall be made at destination.  FAR 52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (JAN 2004) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The provision at 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is incorporated and applies to this acquisition.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement, 2) price, 3) past performance.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  Technical capability will be determined on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the Offeror to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposal.  The Offeror shall provide backup information verifying the price offered, e.g. a copy of the current catalog, three invoices for the same equipment, etc.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror with the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (May 2004) with its proposal.  FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (Oct. 2003) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>As a result of an unsolicited proposal, NASA/HQ intends to negotiate and award a contract to TECOP International.  Proposal is to study the R&D in civil aeronautics related to large transport aircraft airframes, aircraft engines, rotorcraft, air traffic management and general aviation sponsored by the European Commission and member nations.  The research is to identify possible areas of mutual concern such as research cooperation that could yield results in a more timely and efficient manner, areas of mutually beneficial standardization, and to relate the European efforts in civil aeronautics R&D to its "Vision 2020" document.	GSFC intends to negotiate with TECOP International on a sole source basis.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented at FAR Part 6.302-1.  Pursuant to 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), TECOP has submitted an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a unique capability to provide the research services, offers a concept and service not otherwise available to the Government and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive acquisition.  TECOP International's demonstrated knowledge of European R&D in civil aeronautics; an established information network in Europe; and team expertise in analysis of technology and economics as they relate to the aviation industry are key factors.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Jami Rodgers, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4781
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) Radiation Protection Division (RPD) Center for Radiation Site Cleanup intends to award fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a  written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items,  apply to this acquisition.  The Government will award a Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  BACKGROUND: EPA's Radiation  Protection Division is dedicated to minimizing incidences of lost radioactive sources that enter into consumer metal supplies and the public domain.   Radioactive sealed sources commonly found in industrial devices and consumer products have the potential to become lost, stolen, or abandoned and  enter into the public domain.  Once in the public domain, the sources may be subjected to harsh conditions capable of exposing the radioactive source  providing the potential to expose the public to harmful radiation.  In addition to the public health risk, the financial impacts associated with the  contamination of industrial facilities and consumer metal supplies are substantial. In previous efforts with the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, the World Resource Institute and Yale University, the utility of materials flow accountings in the management of radioactive sources has  been investigated.  The commercial radioisotope industry has proven to possess unique attributes that offer potential of voluntary reporting of data for the improved management of these materials.  In conjunction with data provided by other agencies and the possibility of voluntary reporting of  data from industrial suppliers of source producers and manufacturers, materials flow accountings may potentially provide opportunities for better managing radioactive sources through the entire commercial life cycle. This Purchase Order will address the feasibility of a voluntary reporting  initiative with manufacturers of radioactive sources and devices and how this information could effectively be coordinated with other data sources in a materials flow account (MFA).  MFA will support more effective environmental management strategies to control radioactive sources used in  commercial applications in the economy of the United States. Using Co-60 as a pilot isotope, the Contractor shall complete an inventory of Co-60 sources entering in and currently circulating through the economy and apply a materials balance approach to evaluate the flow of Co-60 through the  economy.  This Purchase Order shall provide an assessment of all manufacturers, producers, disposal options, and licencee information in agreement states in an attempt to develop a useful framework for collecting data through a voluntary reporting effort with industry.  This assessment will include  an evaluation of the level of willingness of participation in a voluntary reporting effort by industry stakeholders, data collection protocols, and data base formats.  This Purchase Order shall also investigate recommendations concerning coordinating voluntary reporting efforts by source producers  and device manufacturers with existing initiatives aimed at source tracking in the Federal Government.  TASKS: The Contractor shall perform the following tasks. TASK 1: Document existing data sources for Co-60 considering manufacturers, consumers, disposal facilities, and licensee information from  the NRC, agreement states and any other relevant federal and state agency.  Additionally, the Contractor shall identify gaps in data.  The Contractor shall develop an initial protocol for data collection. DELIVERABLE: A progress report detailing all data sources of Co-60 and the mechanism required  to collect the data.  For example, if the source of data is a government agency, what requirements must be met to collect the data from that source.  The report shall also include any voids in data that would be required for a complete materials balance and an initial protocol for data collection  for all sources of data. DUE DATE: September 30, 2004. TASK 2:  The Contractor shall gather available data from appropriate sources according to the approved initial protocol developed in Task 1. The EPA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)  will specify the temporal range of data collection.   The Contractor shall conduct interviews with industrial entities that either are Co-60 source producers or manufacturers of devices containing Co-60 and assess the level of willingness to participate in a voluntary reporting of data efforts.  EPA will determine discussion questions. The Contractor  shall assess the level of participation based on responses to discussions with the Contractor, but will in no way indicate a commitment by a given manufacturer.  The Contractor shall analyze data bases for organizing and maintaining data. DELIVERABLE: A progress report summarizing all data  collected as well as any gaps in data.  The report shall also include summaries of discussions between the contractor and manufacturers and an evaluation of a data base. DUE DATE: December 30, 2004. TASK 3: The Contractor shall conduct and assessment of the feasibility of an industrial voluntary  reporting effort for Co-60 source producers and device manufacturers containing Co-60 of sales data on a yearly basis.  Utility of a voluntary reporting scheme in conjunction with other source tracking efforts shall be evaluated.  Recommendations shall be provided on data collection protocols and  data bases.  DELIVERABLE:  A final report incorporating all criterial in Task 3. DUE DATE:  March 30, 2005. QUOTE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: The Offeror shall prepare a succinct project plan which demonstrates an understanding of the Statement of Work (no more than 10 pages, not including resumes).  The Offeror shall identify key staff proposed for this requirement. For the labor category of Project Manager, the Offeror shall describe qualifications, education and experience of managing projects similar in nature. The Offeror shall also provide three references who can evaluate performance  based on similar requirements. The Offeror shall also include a cost proposal, including a labor-hour quote with a ceiling price for this requirement. The Contractor shall include proposed amounts for any indirect costs and other direct costs. Copies of the project plan and cost proposal shall be  submitted electronically to Contract Specialist Jami Rodgers at rodgers.jami@epa.gov and COR Sally Hamlin at hamlin.sally@epa.gov by the response date. EVALUATION FACTORS: The Government intends to make award to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the Request for Quote (RFQ) and is most  advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered. For this RFQ, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. I. Technical Expertise/Merit: The Contractor shall demonstrate expertise in conducting and  interpreting voluntary reporting as it relates to radioactive sources. II. Key Personnel: The Contractor shall demonstrate availability of staff, facilities and equipment for the performance of the tasks listed in this Statement of Work.

<SUBJECT>R -- Quantifying Improvements Based on Lab Testing of Questionnaires
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-000HCS13200409713
<RESPDATE>061004
<ARCHDATE>06252004
<CONTACT>Jennifer Bayer, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513)533-8586, Fax (513)533-8283, Email jmh8@cdc.gov - Dwight Favors, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone (513)533-8137, Fax (513)533-8283, Email dyf3@cdc.gov
<DESC>Negotiation are being conducted on a sole source basis with the University of Massachusetts at Boston, Center for Survey Research for quantifying improvements based on laboratory testing of questionnaires.


Background Information:  This requirement is requested by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Office of Research and Methodology, for a research organization to assist in a methodological investigation involving alternative versions of survey questions.  Specifically, this study will evaluate whether questionnaire revisions based on cognitive interviewing or other forms of technical appraisal are easier to administer in a standardized manner, pose fewer problems for respondents while answering, or generate response distributions that are more plausible or consistent with expectations than the original versions.  The contractor will collaborate with NCHS staff to select appropriate questions to be included in the study; administer a split-ballot telephone survey; behavior-code the results; and collaborate with NCHS staff in analyzing the data; therefore, the contractor must have expertise in all of these areas.

Objective:   The purpose of this requirement is to procure the professional services of a research organization capable of collecting and interpreting data necessary to explore the benefits of alternative question wordings.  Specifically, this will involve selection of appropriate questions and their alternatives, collection of survey data, and performing a highly specific task known as behavior coding.  These efforts should be led by a senior researcher with expertise in questionnaire design and survey methods who will oversee this data collection and advise NCHS throughout the project. 

It is widely accepted that cognitive interviewing is a useful tool for questionnaire design, but there have not been many attempts to demonstrate that cognitive interviewing recommendations result in question wordings that are “better” (i.e., provide more accurate data or are easier to administer) than previous wordings.  Part of the difficulty is practical B often there is no gold standard to determine the accuracy of survey responses (and some gold standards such as medical records are not necessarily better, since they sometimes include errors of their own).  One of the few attempts to look into whether cognitive re-designed questions are actually better was conducted by Willis and Schechter (1997).  Their study used split-ballot experiments to compare responses from before-and-after question wordings.  Although there was no way to externally verify their survey data, responses from the modified question were more plausible and closer to expected findings than the previous versions.

Some of the major hypotheses to be considered are:  

&#61507;	Some questions are difficult to answer because they actually contain two distinct concepts-- splitting them into two separate questions will change response distributions in expected manners and will reduce administration difficulties.
 

&#61507;	Presentation of qualifying information is easier to process when it appears after the primary subject matter of the question has been presented.  In other words, it may be significantly easier for respondents to answer a question such as, AHave you been to a doctor, not including X, Y, and Z@ than ANot counting X, Y, and Z, have you been to a doctor?@  At present, questionnaire design literature contains no guidance about optimal structuring of complex questions. 

&#61507;	Re-wordings that clarify vague concepts will significantly affect response distributions and reduce interviewer-respondent negotiations about meaning; however, expanding question length to explain nuances of meaning that only apply to a small subset of respondents will not affect response distributions, and may increase the complexity of interviewer-respondent interactions. In other words, it may be better to provide such clarifications only when respondents need them.

Scope of Work:  In order to achieve the above objectives, the following activities will be carried out under this requirement:

1a) Select about 10-15 complex health survey questions.  Some of these may be draft questions proposed for surveys such as the NHIS, while others may be questions that have actually been fielded.
  
1b) Compile (or construct) alternative versions of each of these questions.  For example, sometimes laboratory testing or technical reviews have led to alternative versions that split one long question into two smaller ones; restructured the wording within a particular question; or proposed new wordings or response categories.  In some cases the alternatives have been incorporated onto fielded surveys, while in other cases the original version was retained.  (This could be for the sake of consistency over time, consistency with other surveys, or based on a determination that the evidence in favor of changing the question was not sufficiently compelling.)  In either case, there are often two versions of questions available that apparently measure the same thing; however, there may not be clear evidence that one or the other is measurably “better.”

2) Embed the questions into split-ballot experiments on an RDD telephone survey.  With respondent permission, as many of these interviews as possible would be tape-recorded.   The overall sample size should be approximately n=450 at the level of funding requested, which should be adequate to detect significant differences across question versions.  The actual sample size may vary based on the total number of questions included in the instrument.

Data would be collected by telephone due to maximizing the number of interviews conducted at a reasonable cost.  It is also more feasible to tape-record and behavior code interviews that are conducted at a central telephone facility.   Many of the questions to be tested are used on both face-to-face and telephone surveys and the use of this mode should not diminish the value of findings.

 
3) Behavior-code those interviews that were successfully tape-recorded.  The behavior coding technique was developed by Cannell and colleagues to measure both interviewer and respondent behavior during the process of administering and answering questions.  Thus, the method is used to identify questions that:

&#61507;	interviewers have difficulty administering as written
&#61507;	require extensive probing before codeable answers can be obtained
&#61507;	respondents interrupt 
&#61507;	need to be repeated

4) Provide tabulations from survey data and behavior coding, copies of datasets and appropriate technical documentation; and collaborate on analysis of the data collected in association with the project officer, including a preliminary report based on findings.  

Period of Performance:  From date of award of a purchase order through December 31, 2004


Deliverables:

1.	Alternative versions of questionnaire to be included in the study, to be selected in collaboration with the NCHS project officer.  Overview of the research design and general plan of the experiments, including basic procedures to be followed and approximate number of research subjects.  The overview should also include suggestions of possible survey items to be included in the experiments.  Due approximately 9 weeks following award of contract.

2.	Tabulations of the survey data collected in telephone interviews and a report of survey procedures and field results.  Due approximately 24 weeks following award of contract.

3.	Tabulations of behavior coding data, electronic copies of datasets associated with the project datasets, and a preliminary report of findings.  Due approximately 30 weeks after award of contract.  


Certification Statement:  This contract meets applicable policies and procedures in OMB Circular A-120.  Contractor shall perform only those services described in the scope of work.  All materials relating to this contract are the property of the government and shall be returned to the government at the completion of work.  The contractor shall not release any information related to the work performed or the results obtained without the written permission of the project officer.  

Capabilities Requirements:  Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.  To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they have the following:


At least ten years experience and expertise in:

INTENDED SOURCE: AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY (AACAP)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH EIGHT AND A HALF (8 1/2) MONTHS

PURPOSE:

   THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES (DHHS), SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA ), CENTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES (CMHS) THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER-DIVISION OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT  PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.
CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 10, 200

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS TO:

BACKGROUND:

A. RATIONALE
MINORITIES REPRESENT LESS THAN 10% OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.  INCREASING THE NUMBERS OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY MENTAL-HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IS NECESSARY TO SERVE THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES, TO PROMOTE RESPONSIVENESS TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE GROUPS AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. 

TRADITIONALLY, FEW MINORITIES SELECT THE SPECIALTY OF PSYCHIATRY, AND EVEN FEWER, AND ADVANCED RESIDENCY OF TWO MORE YEARS IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.  NEVERTHELESS, SURVEYS HAVE REPEATEDLY IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS TO MEET EXISTING CLINICAL NEEDS.  BECAUSE SO FEW MEDICAL STUDENTS ENTER CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY, AND EVEN FEWER ARE FROM MINORITY GROUPS, MINORITY PRESENCE NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED.  AS THE UNITED STATES POPULATION BECOMES MORE ETHICALLY AND RACIALLY DIVERSE, THE NUMBER OF PRACTITIONERS SERVING THIS
COMMUNITY NEEDS TO INCREASE PROPORTIONATELY.  THE TREATMENT, DIAGNOSIS, AND PREVENTION OF MENTAL ILLNESSES EXPERIENCED BY CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MINORITIES ARE BEST HANDLED BY MINORITY PSYCHIATRISTS WHO ARE SENSITIVE TO THEIR OWN CULTURE'S UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS.  THE AACAP UNDERSTANDS THAT IF MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE NOT INTRODUCED TO CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY, THEY WILL NOT PURSUE CAREERS IN THIS AREA.  THEREFORE, PROMISING MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS MUST BE EXPOSED TO THE CLINICAL PRACTICE OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY. 

SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS WITH MEDICAL SPECIALISTS IN GENERAL, AND CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS IN PARTICULAR, ILLUSTRATE THAT THE KEY TO STIMULATING INTEREST IS EARLY EXPOSURE TO CHALLENGING CLINICAL EXPERIENCES AND PERSONAL CONTACT WITH MENTORS.  CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY MUST BE PRESENTED AS A VIABLE CAREER FOR MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS AND AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A VERY CRITICAL WAY.


	
	
	THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO:
	-HEIGHTEN AWARENESS OF THE OPPORTUNITIES IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE CONTRACTOR'S EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THE FOLLOWING:

THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY (AACAP) IS THE ONLY U.S. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS.  ITS MEMBERSHIP (6,900) INCLUDES THE LEADING RESEARCHERS, ACADEMICS, AND PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD.  THE ACADEMY'S MONTHLY JOURNAL (JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY) AND ANNUAL MEETING BOTH INCLUDE SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL PAPERS AND PRESENTATIONS ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL DISORDERS.  

THE AACAP HAS EMBARKED ON A 10-YEAR PLAN TO RECRUIT MORE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS INTO CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.  THERE ARE OVER 15 MILLION CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF TREATMENT. APPROXIMATELY 7,000 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE PRACTICING, TEACHING, AND CONDUCTING RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT ON MENTAL HEALTH IN 1999 STATED:  'THERE IS A DEARTH OF CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS."  IN FACT, AS FAR BACK AS 1980, THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT OVER 34,000 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS WOULD BE NEEDED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION.

THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH WORK FORCE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE BUREAU OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS FORECASTED THAT THE DEMAND FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SERVICES WOULD INCREASE BY 100% BETWEEN 1995 AND 2020. HOWEVER, IT PROJECTED THE INCREASE OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS TO BE ONLY 30%.  THE NEED FOR MINORITIES IS EVEN GREATER.  OVERALL, THE AACAP IS COMMITTED TO INCREASING RECRUITMENT INTO CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY BY 10% EACH YEAR, BEGINNING IN 2004, OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

EXISTING AWARDS AND PROGRAMS SHOW AACAP'S COMMITMENT TO ENHANCING THE RECRUITMENT OF MINORITIES AND SUPPORTING CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC EDUCATION IN GENERAL AND THE RECRUITMENT OF MINORITIES SPECIFICALLY.  THE ACADEMY HAS ADMINISTERED THE NIMH-FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL PHYSICIAN SCIENTIST DEVELOPMENT AWARD (K12) AND THE NIDA-FUNDED MENTORED CLINICAL SCIENTIST AWARD (K12), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE INCLUDED MINORITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN MENTORING PROGRAMS THAT FACILITATE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH.  THE AACAP ALSO SPONSORS A PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLAR PROGRAM THAT OFFERS FIVE AWARDS EACH YEAR TO CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY RESIDENTS IN THE AREAS OF RESEARCH, PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION.  THE PROGRAM, INSTITUTED IN 1997, PROVIDES FUNDING FOR EACH RECIPIENT TO SPEND A WEEK UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF A CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY MENTOR ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 1991, THE AACAP'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH IMPLEMENTED AN INITIAL PROGRAM THROUGH NIMH TO RECRUIT MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS INTO CAREERS IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH. IN 1993, THE ACADEMY WAS AWARDED AN NIMH T35 MINORITY RECRUITMENT RESEARCH CAREERS GRANT TO SUPPORT THE JAMES COMER MINORITY RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS.  THESE WERE OFFERED FROM 1991 THROUGH 2000.  NAMED AFTER JAMES COMER, AN EMINENT CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIST, THE COMER FELLOWSHIPS RECRUITED MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS INTO CAREERS IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH BY PROVIDING EARLY, HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH.  THE FELLOWSHIPS WERE DESIGNED TO OFFER THE STUDENTS A CHANCE TO MEET AND WORK WITH MENTORS AND ROLE MODELS AS WELL AS DEVELOP A GROUP IDENTITY AS INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH.  THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO CREATE A GROUP OF MINORITY CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY INVESTIGATORS TO FOLLOW, ENCOURAGE, AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS.  OVER THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS, THE COMER FELLOWSHIPS PROVIDED 94 OUTSTANDING MEDICAL STUDENTS STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.  

FROM 1995 THROUGH 2003, UNDER CONTRACT FROM CMHS, AACAP DEVELOPED A PROGRAM FOR RECRUITING MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS INTO CLINICAL CAREERS IN ADOLESCENT AND CHILD PSYCHIATRY.  AACAP SOLICITED APPLICATIONS FROM MINORITY MEDICAL STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A SUMMER FELLOWSHIP THAT FOCUSED ON GAINING SUPERVISED CLINICAL EXPERIENCE.  THE CULMINATION OF THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR WAS WHEN THE FELLOWS PRESENTED THEIR EXPERIENCES IN A POSTER SESSION AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AACAP.  EVALUATIONS OF THE EXPERIENCE BY MENTORS AND SELF-REPORTS FROM THE MEDICAL STUDENTS INDICATED CONSISTENTLY HIGH LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS PROGRAM.  

	THE CONTRACTORS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH A VERY SIMILAR RELATED MISSION, AACAP HAS ALREADY FORMED A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH A HOST OF EXPERTS IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE KEY RESOURCES AND CRITICAL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS EFFORT.  THESE PRE-EXISTENT RELATIONSHIPS REPRESENT THE BASIS FOR THE EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG TEAM EFFORT NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT CONTRACT, WITH AACAP AS AN ALREADY ESTABLISHED NATURAL LEADER FOR THIS PROCESS.
	
	AACAP HAS ILLUSTRATED ITS CAPABILITY TO CARRY OUT A CONSULTIVE, COORDINATED PROJECT WITHIN REQUIRED TIME PARAMETERS.  OTHER THAN ITS OVERHEAD AND DIRECT LABOR, AACAP WOULD RECEIVE VERY LITTLE FROM THIS PROJECT BEYOND GRATIFICATION FOR UNDERTAKING A STRENUOUS COLLABORATIVE ENDEAVOR OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.
	
	WITH CHANGES TO HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION AND FINANCING RAPIDLY REVOLUTIONIZING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR MENTAL HEALTH, THAT AFFECT THE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT POPULATION, WORK ON THIS PROJECT MUST BEGIN IMMEDIATELY.  THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE EXTREMELY CRITICAL TO CMHS IN PLANNING FOR FUTURE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION AND FINANCING INITIATIVE AND PROGRAMS FOR MINORITIES.  THUS, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL IF THIS CONTRACT WERE NOT CARRIED OUT AT THIS TIME.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: MAY 27, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04R000159

INTENDED SOURCE: NATIONAL PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION (NPSF)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWO (2) MONTHS

PURPOSE:

   THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (DHHS), AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER-DIVISION OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT  PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO NATIONAL PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION .
CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 10, 2004

   THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS TO:

BACKGROUND:  

THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) IS HOSTING MAKING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SAFER:  3RD ANNUAL PATIENT SAFETY CONFERENCE ON SEPTEMBER 26-28, 2004.  THE CONFERENCE WILL HOST MANY RESEARCHERS AND DISPLAY THE PRODUCTS, TOOLS AND FINDINGS OF AHRQ SUPPORTED PATIENT SAFETY RESEARCHERS.  THE NATIONAL PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION (NPSF) IS LARGE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY IN ALL ITS FORMS INCLUDING EDUCATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND RESEARCH.  

AHRQ IS THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TASKED BY CONGRESS TO EXAMINE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND TO OFFER EVIDENCE TO HELP MAKE SYSTEM INPROVEMENTS THAT WILL REDUCE HARM TO PATIENTS.  THE CURRENT BUDGET FOR THE TASK IS FAR LESS THAN IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT RESEARCH THAT WILL PRODUCE THE TOOLS, EDUCATION MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE ALL COMPONENTS OF THE US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.  AHRQ PARTNERS WITH MANY ORGANIZATIONS WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR CONSTITUENCIES AND PATIENT SAFETY INTERESTS.  THE NATIONAL PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION (NPSF) CONGRESS IS UNIQUE IN THAT ATTENDEES ARE INTERESTED IN A SINGLE FOCUS: PATIENT SAFETY.  FURTHERMORE, NPSF ATTENDEES CUT ACROSS ALL COMPONENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM INCLUDING CAREGIVERS, ADMISITRATORS, PATIENTS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, LABS AND MEDICAL TRAINING.  THE EXPECTED ATTENDANCE FOR THE NPSF IS OVER 1500 INDIVIDUALS, MANY OF WHOM WILL BE AHRQ GRANTEES.  

OBTAINING THE PROCEEDINGS AND PARTICIPANTS LIST FROM ALL OF THE NPSF CONGRESS SESSIONS ASSISTS THE GOVERNMENT ON SEVERAL WAYS: (1) AHRQ IS ABLE TO EXPAND INVITATIONS TO RESEARCHERS AND EXPERTS IN PATIENT SAFETY RESEARCH TO ATTEND ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE RESULTING IN A RICH AND VARIED DISCUSSION AND CREATES A SYNERGY WITH AHRQ GRANTEES PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW PARTNERSHIPS; (2) IN ORDER TO MORE FULLY INFORM CONGRESS ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THEIR PATIENT SAFETY INVESTMENT, AHRQ IA ABLE TO COMBINE EVIDENCE OF SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS FROM TH ENPSF CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS WITH EXISTING AHRQ GRANTEES RESEARCH TO SUPPORT METHODS THAT IMPROVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SAFETY, AND INFORMATION GAPS THAT NEED TO BE PURSUED; AND (3) COMBINING KNOWLEDGE FROM EVIDENCE-BASED SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR (AHRQ) WITH EVIDENCE-BASED SCIENCE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR (NPSF) RESULTS IN A POWERFUL ALLIANCE THAT NOT ONLY INCREASES THE IMPACT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS DEDICATED TO PATIENT RESEARCH BUT RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY.

SCOPE OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES:

WE ARE ASKING THE NPSF TO PROVIDE TO AHRQ:  (1) PROCEEDINGS FROM THE OVER 70 PRESENTATIONS OF THE CONFERENCE; (2) POSTER REPRINTS AND CONTACT INFORMATION ON OVER 40 RESEARCH POSTERS; AND (3) A MAILING LIST FOR CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS THAT AHRQ CAN USE TO MARKET ITS PATIENT SAFETY CONFERENCE AND TO USE AS A DATABASE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL REVIEWERS FOR STUDY SECTION MEMBERSHIP, NATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP, INNOVATIVE RESEARCHERS, AND INVITEES TO FUTURE CONFERENCES.  ALL THREE DELIVERABLES ARE DUE NOT LATER THAN JULY 1, 2004. 


  SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

THE NATIONAL PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION (NPSF) IS THE ONLY NOT-FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT IS AS BROAD BASED IN ITS EXAMINATION OF PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES AS AHRQ AND IS HOLDING A CONGRESS AT A TIME THAT WOULD PROVIDE HELPFUL FOR AHRQ'S OWN CONFERENCE ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE FOCUS OF NPSF'S MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTHCARE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF PARTNERS WHO CAN HELP US EDUCATION AND DISSEMINATE RESEARCH, TOOLS, PRODUCTS, AND FINDING TO CLINICIAN, HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND CONSUMERS NPSF IS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROVIDE AHRQ WITH PROCEEDINGS FROM THE CONGRESS AND RESEARCH POSTER SESSION.  IN ADDITION, AHRQ DOES NOT KNOW OF ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION THAT CAN PROVIDE A CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED MAILING LIST OF A BROAD RANGE OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN PATIENT SAFETY THAT CAN BE INVITED TO ITS SEPTEMBER 26-28 CONFERENCE.  THE AHRQ PATIENT SAFETY TEAM NEEDS TO KEEP CURRENT ON OTHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN PATIENT SAFETY.  THE NPSF CONGRESS AFFORDS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AHRQ TO LEARN FROM PRESENTERS AND PARTICIPANTS IN ONE ORGANIZED VENUE.  USING THIS GATHERED INFORMATION WILL ASSIST AHRQ TO LEVERAGE BUDGET DOLLARS BY ENCOURAGING RESEARCHERS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE SAME AREAS TO PARTNER; TO AVOID DUPLICATION, AND TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER PATIENT SAFETY INFORMATION TO THE VARIOUS HEALTHCARE AUDIENCES.



   THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), to acquire on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) with Samueli Institute, Corona Del Mar, CA, to identify and investigate integrated healing practices that may be useful for veterans returning from the Iraq War and Afghanistan, and those at the end-of-life.  The United States Congress has established the Veterans Heal (VETHEAL) program to explore the application of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to military relevant situations.  Specifically, to enable individuals and institutions to perform basic and clinical research studies on specific CAM approaches that may assist the soldier in the operational environment and that may benefit military populations.  USUHS has partnered with Samueli Institute for the independent scientific evaluation of proposals submitted for funding under the VETHEAL program.  Under the VETHEAL program the contractor will:  1) conduct two clinical research projects specifically designed to evaluate the effect of integrated healing practices that may be useful for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress in soldiers returning from deployment and conflict areas as Iraq and Afghanistan; 2) conduct two clinical research projects specifically designed to evaluate the effect of optimal healing interventions integrated into hospice and nursing home care and at Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Centers that may be useful for veterans nearing the end-of-life; 3) work in a coordinated effort with USUHS for scientific review and management of the program; 4) work in collaboration with Department of Defense (DoD) and VA centers to investigate the role of these practices in the care of veterans; and 5) conduct and manage complementary medicine research with military populations.  The proposed acquisition is an add-on effort under contract, MDA905-03-C-0003 and will be procured under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The period of performance will be for one year from the date the modification is signed with the option to extend services for one additional year. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, all interested parties may contact the Contracting Officer for details.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office by June 11, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from contractors interested in entering into a Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (s) to support the world wide demand for Primary Total Hip Implants, Hemi-Arthoplasty Hip Implants, Primary Total Knee Implants and all components necessary for implantation.   Contractors will be required to submit a catalog, detailing their entire product line that falls within these product line groups.  All products must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.  We intend to award contracts to manufacturers who submit offerors that comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Initially, contractor’s will be asked to supply a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog, which includes all facilities located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  The offeror may include Alaska and Hawaii as a separately priced catalog to incorporate any additional transportation costs.  The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States and will be required in the future.  Each manufacturer’s product line will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs. Physicians from the ordering facility will make a “Best Value” decision when selecting products.  

Delivery for Primary Total Knee and Primary Total Hip Implants, with all instrumentation sets necessary for implantation will be “Just-in-Time”.  Delivery of Knee and Hip Components and instrumentation sets necessary for implant surgery will be “Direct Delivery”.  This procurement contains an on-site personnel requirement for the contractor to provide technical advice and guidance to physicians before, during and after implantation at the request of the Medical Treatment Facility.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  Each vendor will be required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication options available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standards and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Vendors must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  Vendors will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.

The subject solicitation is a standing solicitation that will remain in effect unless replaced by an updated solicitation.  Closing dates and time for receipt of proposals are hereby established as 3:00 P.M./EST on the last business day of every month.  Vendors can submit proposals any time prior to the closing date.  However, evaluation of all proposals received by the closing date will not be evaluated until the solicitation has closed.  Any resultant contract will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $20 million dollars over the total contract period for all contracts combined.  Solicitation SP0200-04-R-5008 is expected to become available June 25, 2004 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.dla.mil/home/

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations having the ability to serve as one of the initial Study sites for the National Children’s Study (NCS).  Background information on the NCS is available at www.nationalchildrensStudy.gov.  The National Children’s Study is a longitudinal cohort Study that intends to examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 children. Environment is broadly defined to include biological, physical, chemical, and social/cultural influences on children’s health and development.  Priority outcomes are expected to include obesity, diabetes, and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; child development and mental health.  Children will be followed from before birth until the age of 21 years.  The goal of the Study is to learn information that will ultimately lead to improvement in the health and well being of children.  The NICHD is exploring various strategies to ensure that results from the Study have broad application to American children.  A leading strategy for enrollment of Study participants is to enroll through approximately 30-50 sites across the country. Initially, approximately five sites will be selected to serve as initial or Vanguard sites.  We anticipate that more sites may be added later under separate acquisitions.  All Study sites will be expected to follow a common Study protocol. Additionally, the initial sites will pilot new Study procedures prior to implementation in the full complement of Study sites.  It is expected that the full complement of Study sites will be subsequently phased-in as full funding for this effort becomes available. A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL BE RELEASED FOR A SINGLE, COMPETITIVELY AWARDED NCS COORDINATING CENTER (NCS-CC).

To be deemed capable, a small business must: 1) Demonstrate a clear understanding of the complexity of this Study, including the need for complex multi-level sampling strategies for selection of Study neighborhoods and participants within neighborhoods; the longitudinal nature of the data collection; the need to collect, process, and ship environmental samples and biologic specimens from multiple sites; and the need to collect interview data from multiple participants including pregnant women, fathers, and other primary caregivers, and children; 2) Demonstrate ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings; 3) Provide evidence of ability to identify, recruit, and enroll at least 2000 maternal-infant dyads over a 4-year enrollment period; 4) Provide evidence of ability to collect, process and ship/transport biologic specimens from mothers, fathers, and offspring; and environmental specimens from the household and neighboring environment; 5) Provide evidence of the ability to enroll participants and collect Study specimens and information (environmental, interview, and biologic) prior to conception and early in pregnancy; 6) Demonstrate the ability to retain and follow Study participants from all socioeconomic groups, including the medically underserved.  [It is anticipated that measurements that require in-person contact will occur at least three times during pregnancy, around the time of delivery, approximately 3 additional times in the first year of life, annually until 4 years of age, and every 3-5 years until the age of 21 years.  Collection of interview data may occur at more frequent intervals.]; 7) Provide evidence of ability to collect cord blood and the placenta at the time of delivery; 8) Provide evidence of understanding and experience in packaging and transporting biological and non-biological samples to a repository(ies) from the site.  (Note: The NCS-Coordinating Center will develop standard operating procedures in collaboration with the Study sites.); 9) Provide evidence of the ability to perform a standardized examination of the newborn as well as other clinical and neurodevelopmental exams throughout childhood; 10) Provide evidence of the ability (equipment and expertise) to perform 3-D fetal ultrasounds; Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA); Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA); detailed developmental and psychometric assessments; placement, calibration and use of instruments to collect environmental samples, and other measures as selected in the development of the protocol.; 11) Demonstrate previous experience in the implementation of Quality Assurance/Quality Control activities covering the collection of interview data; collection, storage, and shipping of biologic and environmental specimens; and collection of field observational data;  12) Provide evidence of qualified personnel to oversee all aspects of the Study, as outlined above.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>TACOM-Picatinny has a requirement for the development and implementation of the Marine Corps range assessment program known as the Range Environmental  Vulnerability Assessment (REVA), which includes performing baseline range and training area assessments and modeling for potential munitions constituent releases at Marine Corps installations.  REVA is a Headquarters Marine Corps  (HQMC) sponsored initiative under their Range and Munitions Programs.  The main objective of REVA is to characterize and assess ranges and training areas across the Marine Corps to identify areas and activities that are vulnerable or potentially vulnerable to environmentally related regulatory or physical encroachment.  Regulatory encroachment may include, but is not limited to, potential pressures from environmental laws, regulations, policy, and guidelines including addressing emerging contaminants that may occur on ranges or training areas.  REVA is a comprehensive program designed to be the foundation for sustaining Marine Corps operational ranges and training areas.  At this time, the Government is contemplating a sole source award to Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. under an Indefinite-delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  A draft solicitation will be published on or about 6/14/04 subject to the availability of funds and can be found at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Note 22 applies.

Proposals for this project were already received in two phases - technical and price. Phase I (Technical) has concluded. The Government evaluated Phase I (Technical) proposals and established a "competitive range" based on the offerors received. Offerors determined to be in the competitive range were published at www.fedbizopps.gov on December 23, 2002. The above named short-listed general contractors submitted Phase II (Price) Proposals on November 4, 2003. Prices and scope were re-evaluated resulting in a Request for Final Price Proposal Revisions received on Tuesday, January 13, 2004. Due to the significant amount of time that has elapsed since the first Final Proposal Revision was received and since steel prices now appear to have stabilized, we are requesting a second round of Final Price Proposal Revisions.  They will be due Tuesday, June 15, 2004. Plans and Specifications, which include 8 amendments, may be purchased only
from Lane Blueprint, 1520 Main Street, Kansas City, MO 64108, ph: (816) 221-2500. Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must provide to Lane Blueprint a valid identification in the form of one of the following: a business license; DUNS number; or valid state driver's license. The planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications. The cost of drawings and specifications is non-refundable. 







ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  Request for Proposals Notice for the Edward Zorinsky Federal Building Renovation, Omaha, Nebraska, Job PCN: INE99004.  Request for Technical Proposals o/a 10-01-02.   Request for Price Proposal o/a 02-18-03.  Estimated cost range:  $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Time for completion: 420 calendar days.  Summary of project:  The purpose of this source selection is to select a highly qualified construction contractor to provide renovation construction services on an existing Federal Office Building.  The Federal Office Building will be 430,000 gross square foot building located in Omaha, Nebraska and consists of nine (9) stories above grade, a basement, and partial sub-basement below grade plus a mechanical penthouse and small elevator penthouse at the top of the building.  This portion of the renovation will be a ?shell? construction contract which will include site/landscaping work, exterior demolition, exterior construction, some existing structural modifications, shell mechanical, electrical and plumbing, plus interior layout and finish work. Tenant fit out work will be procured under separate contract by GSA.  In compliance with Executive Order 12770, the building is designed and will be constructed entirely with metric dimensions.  There may be minimal asbestos removal.  The bidder, or subcontractor used by the bidder, shall meet the competency qualification requirements for asbestos removal as specified in Section 00120 of the specification.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos removal shall satisfy special responsibility and shall provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with hazardous materials involved.  Proposals will include a base bid, and options.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process. Phase I will be technical evaluations; Phase II will be for pricing. The Government intends to use the ?greatest value concept? in selecting the prime contractor.  The ?greatest value concept? is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  

Phase I, the Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP), contains a general scope of work, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  This RFTP will be issued on or about 09-13-02. All requests for the RFTP must be in writing.  Contact Joe York at 816-823-4915 or fax 816-926-3571.   There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about 
10-16-02.  Proposals shall be received on or about 12-05-02 at the GSA, Office of Business & Support Services (6ADB), Federal Building, 1500 East Bannister Road, Room 1161, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088..  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFTP.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number on the face of the envelope for identification purposes.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52-215-1.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  There will be a short list of technically qualified contractors published in the FedBizOpps on or about 12-13-02.

Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered:  
(1) a technical evaluation factor, and (2) price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance, are:  (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm (50%), (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel (35%), and (3) Management and Technical Approach (15%). The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factor.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price becomes more important.  Joint venture arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependence of the members to provide a quality team.  The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those firms within the ?competitive range.? Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of: (1) pricing, (2) Subcontracting Plan, and (3) special competency requirements as specified in the specifications.

Phase II, Specifications (Bidding Documents) and drawings will be available for review at plan rooms at no cost.  The documents may be purchased by full size,  half size, and CD (cost to be determined later).  Cost is non-refundable.  Bidders interested in obtaining the bidding documents will need to make financial arrangements directly with Lane Blueprinting, 1520 Main Street, Kansas City MO 64108, phone 816-221-2500.  The planholders list will be based on those requesting the documents. The bidding documents will be available on or about 8-30-02.   For further information contact Joe York at phone 816-823-4915, or fax 816-926-3571.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Glen Essink at phone 816-823-4904.

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to negotiate a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the contractor will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Business concerns, Small Business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic limitative of the Federal Government, the GSA has established for fiscal year 2002 subcontracting goals of: 40% for small business, 8% for small disadvantaged business, 5% for women-owned business, 2.5% for HUB Zone, and 5% for Veteran Owned (may include 3% Service Disabled Veteran Owned).  In support of the agency efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract should provide maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities.  Offerors must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize these small businesses.   Phase Two offerors will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their price proposals.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE DECISION (FINAL DECISION) ON ITC STUDY.  The Department of Labor conducted a streamlined competition of OASAM’s ITC Workstation Team.  The contracting officer evaluated the relevant market information and has determined that it is more cost-effective to have federal employees perform the IT functions involved than to have contractor employees perform the function. The SLCF form reflecting the savings is posted at FEDBIZOPPS on today's date. The estimated savings are significant—over a five-year period, performance by federal employees will cost almost $750,737 less than the equivalent performance by the private sector, according to market research. Total Government costs were $4,377,848 while the lowest industry costs were $5,128,585. The determination that performance by federal employees is more cost-effective means this function will remain in-house.   No party may contest any aspect of the outcome of a streamlined competition, this determination is not subject to appeal and is final.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in support of the FRA Human Factors R&D Program plans to procure expertise in occupational health psychology, industrial psychology and safety climate psychometric instrumentation and sources are sought for this expertise.  Current measures of occupational safety performance in the U.S. railroad industry focus almost exclusively on outcome measures such as worker injuries.  Fortunately for the industry injury rates have been declining over the last 25 years.  The industry incident rate fell from a high of 12.1 incidents per 100 workers per year in 1978 to 3.66 in 1996.  Unfortunately for safety researchers and managers this drop in rates has made the use of injury rates as outcome measures suspect by many in the industry.  Thi s procurement will focus on assisting the Volpe Center to identify alternative safety measures in the railroad industry.  One alternative measure found to relate to safety outcomes and reported in published studies is safety climate.  The contractor will be required to provide a finalized safety climate survey with accompanying response form, based on the draft survey provided by the Volpe Center.  The contractor will need to have expertise in on line and paper based surveys in order to design the instrument to address psychometric, and usability issues.  The contractor shall establish the validity and reliability of the instrument.  The contractor will be required to electronically scan and analyze the collected survey data, write a report summarizing the findings using descriptive statis tics and where appropriate inferential statistics.  The contractor will be required to advise on the appropriate statistics for the analysis including such techniques as inter-item correlations, correlations, regression and factor analysis. The survey will be administered at three Canadian railroad research sites at three points in time (baseline, mid term and follow up). The contractor must have prior research experience using established psychometric survey instruments in the areas of occupational health psychology, industrial and organization psychology, organizational behavior, occupational safety climate and/or union-management relations.  Previous experience with railroads, knowledge of railroad operating practices and railroad worker shift work influences preferred.  The contractor  must be acceptable to railroad carrier management and the unionized workers at the three sites.   Interested offerors must submit a capabilities package in two copies demonstrating their abilities in each of the Organization Behavior and Safety Climate Psychometric Instrumentation areas cited above; this capabilities package should not exceed 5 pages. Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 12 days of publication. FAX 617-494-3024 or email: dohertym@volpe.dot.gov response is acceptable. Telephonic requests will not be honored. This is not a solicitation or pre-solicitation. No award will be made from this Sources Sought announcement. For more business opportunities, visit the web site of http://www.volpe.dot.gov and the Small Business Administration (SBA) web  site: http://www.sba.gov. For Minority, Women-Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small Business and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has a program to assist minority, women-owned, and disadvantaged business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to identify potential domestic sources and gather information on current capabilities within the domestic market.  This notice is neither a solicitation for, nor request for competitive proposals.  The Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.), Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating a project to establish a domestic supplier(s) of commercial, deep submicron Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) (<0.5mm) ROICs processed for radiation tolerant and radiation hardened applications in order to meet known and evolving military requirements.  The Title III Radiation Hardened Cryogenic ROIC project will extend the current knowledge and capability to fabricate advanced ROICs for DOD programs at the foundry level.  The Title III program is looking to leverage one or more commercial foundry to make advanced ROICs for the DOD and to incentivize them to achieve the desired geometries (i.e. <0.50 mm) on their commercial production processes for radiation hardened/tolerant cryogenic ROICs.

The Title III Radiation Hardened Cryogenic ROIC program will compliment another envisioned project sponsored by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) that will focus on ROIC architecture development, circuit design, simulation, layout, and verification.  Working together with MDA, Title III will be able to impact both the design and fabrication of the desired geometries (i.e. <0.50 mm) on commercial production processes for radiation hardened/tolerant cryogenic ROICs.  Interested parties should discuss their capabilities concerning production interface with design kits, cell libraries, and process models associated with the ROIC design (i.e. design house and foundry interface).  

The DOD needs highly specialized, mixed mode (analog/digital) circuitry that operates in demanding environments.  Such sophisticated circuitry includes ROICs for imaging devices that need to operate in various combinations of radiation conditions and cryogenic temperatures.  These conditions are typical of airborne and space borne applications.  ROICs are found in focal plane arrays (FPA) for imaging, tracking, and detecting in space and other applications.  The demands for cryogenic radiation hardened/tolerant ROICs designs are increasing each year.  The length of most space missions are increasing therefore increasing the dose of natural radiation the ROIC is exposed to.  Interested parties should be familiar with and be able to comply with the recently approved High Altitude Exoatmospheric Nuclear Survivability standard (MDA-STD-001).  Interested parties should have documented expertise and existing capability in domestic production of ROICs with cryogenic and radiation hardening/tolerant capabilities.  Additionally, the ability to economically produce larger physical size devices (¡Ý6.4cm X 6.4cm) is a requirement.  Government representatives may wish to discuss interested parties DOD ROIC customer base.  Understanding of the current customer base for ROIC (with and without radiation hardening and cryogenic capabilities) is essential in determining business viability and overall project risk factors.  The government contemplates that the Title III Radiation Hardened Cryogenic ROIC project will last 24-36 months.  Other items that will be discussed include business plans as well as an understanding of DOD ROIC production plans to assist in determining market share and their response to customer demands.

Tasks envisioned for the Title III Cryogenic Microelectronics project would include:

-- Demonstrate Manufacturing Process Improvements;
-- Defect Prevention;
-- Yield Improvements;
-- Large Device Processing;
-- Cycle Time Improvement;
-- Special Test Equipment Acquisition;
-- Capital Equipment Enhancement;
-- Production Interface with Design Kits, Cell Libraries, and Process Models;
-- Manufacture ROIC Samples (w/ cryogenic, rad hard (tolerant), and physical size characteristics);
-- Characterize Performance of ROIC Samples;
-- Defect Density and Distribution;
-- Electrical Performance;
-- Radiation Tolerant and Radiation Hardening;
-- Cryogenic Temperatures;

Under the authority of the DPA, any potential acquisition is restricted to sources with domestic production capabilities; therefore, firms without domestic production capabilities are ineligible for any potential award.  All submitted information should be limited to no more than 15 pages, one-sided, minimum font size 10 and should be sent to Susan Palmer, Contract Negotiator, at (937) 656-9883 facsimile (937) 255-5302 or via e-mail at susan.palmer@wpafb.af.mil by 01 JUL 2004 no later than 1500 EST.  Submittals via email are preferred.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS Code for this action is 334413 with a size standard of 500.  All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the technical or contractual points of contact listed above. All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note 25.

<DESC>This snyopsis is issued to express the Government's intent to enter into a sole source contract with Bluemark LLC to support FNS nutrition assistance programs. This effort will focus on providing services in accordance with the following Statement of Work. C.1 		BACKGROUND  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), administers nutrition assistance programs, which provide access to a more nutritious diet for low-income people.  The largest of these programs is the Food Stamp Program (FSP), which provides eligible participants with a monthly allotment of benefits via an electronic benefits card that is used to purchase food at authorized retail stores.  FSP benefits help low income people buy the food they need for good health and aid local economies when they are are redeemed at local food stores. State public assistance agencies operate the FSP through their local offices.  The basic requirements apply in most States.  However, some States have obtained waivers from FNS to operate their programs differently.  Therefore, the FSP does vary from State-to-State.    Since Fiscal Year 2001, FNS has received funds to educate the public about the nutrition benefits of the FSP.  Because they have traditionally underused the program, FNS focuses outreach efforts on seniors, immigrants, and the working poor.  These funds are used to provide individuals with information on how to access this nutrition program.  Outreach is important because as of July 2000, participation in the FSP declined by nearly 40 percent from its peak in March 1994. However, recently the rate began rising again.  The FSP serves about 62 percent of individuals who are eligible for program benefits.  However, FNS' strategic goal is 68 percent participation among eligible people by 2005 FNS is aware that State food stamp offices and nonprofit organizations are using computerized software pre-screening tools to determine potential eligibility for one or more programs.  For the FSP, these pre-screening tools provide their customers with accurate (within $5.00) estimated food stamp benefit amounts. These pre-screening systems are important because they enable potential applicants to be screened for eligibility at sites other than local food stamp offices and facilitate a one-stop shopping approach.  For example, individuals are currently pre-screened for benefits at places of worship, employment sites, schools, hospitals, senior centers, etc.  These tools are also important because they estimate the amount of benefits one could receive.   Research has shown that providing this information helps people understand how the program can impact their own personal situation and encourages them to take the next step to apply. In 2001, FNS requested that the General Services Administration's Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (GSA FEDSIM) provide acquisition and technical support to help FNS acquire and implement an automated pre-screening tool .  GSA FEDSIM issued a Task Order Request (TOR) through Millennia Lite Functional Area 1 for a Requirement Analysis and Market Analysis to assist FNS to make a knowledgeable decision regarding its pre-screening tool.  The contractor was required to recommend one pre-screening tool to the Government, and justify the recommendation.  The contractor recommended a pre-screening tool developed by Community Catalyst, a non-profit organization.  The system is named RealBenefits.    Based on these results, FNS requested GSA FEDSIM to provide acquisition and technical support to help FNS acquire and implement a modified (or customized) version of RealBenefits.. An award was made to VGS through Millennia Lite for this purpose.  This task is now in the maintenance phase.  Since deployment of the prescreening tool, FNS discovered that post development support is required to keep up with changing requirements in the food stamp program environment.  FNS has requested post deployment support. C.2		OBJECTIVE The objective of this Task Order is to provide post deployment support for FNS' Food Stamp Prescreening tool (www.foodstamps-step1.usda.gov.).

<SUBJECT>65--Intent to make a Firm Fixed Price, sole-source award to Digital Technologies Corporation
<DESC>The Department of the Interior/GovWorks intends to make a firm-fixed price award to Digital Technologies Corporation.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC. This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and solicited with FAR 13.3, Simplified Acquisition Methods.  Walter Reed Army Medical Center has the requirement listed below.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities or submit quotes.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, the government will consider all quotes received within 5 days after the date of the publication of this synopsis.  All expressions of interest shall be faxed to 703-787-1009 (Attn: Kathy Giordano) or emailed to kathy.giordano@mms.gov for consideration by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 1.0	Scope The contractor shall provide a firm fixed price for thirty (30) Digital Video over IP (DVIP) cards to meet the distance training needs of Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Regional Anesthesia Distance Learning project. 2.0	Background Walter Reed Army Medical Center's (WRAMC) Regional Anesthesia Service has been funded to develop and implement a Regional Anesthesia Distance Learning project to guide students at the Uniformed Services University (USD) Patient Simulation Laboratory and residence through the use of nerve block techniques. Physicians are reluctant to use opioid-based medications to manage pain for ambulatory surgery because of side effects.  Two techniques that offer a solution to part of this problem are long acting peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) and outpatient continuous peripheral nerve blocks (CPNB).  The Army Regional Anesthesia Initiative at WRAMC has as its principle goal the continued development of this anesthetic technique in the management of acute pain in out patients at home and on the battlefield.  Expertise in these unique anesthetic techniques is concentrated in the WRAMC Anesthesiology faculty with the Army's only fellowship trained regional anesthesiologist directing. Using uncompressed video tele-conferencing over Internet2, WRAMC regional anesthesiologists will guide students and resident through the PNB and CPNB techniques.  DVIP video cards encode and decode audio/video streams with no change to the data in the signals. This state-of-the-art technology will provide Regional Anesthesia trainers with a capability to monitor student progress from a distance and to ensure that students perfect these techniques before using them on real patients.  The value and accuracy of any distant education experience is dependent upon the quality of the audio/video presented at the remote site.  The signal that arrives at the remote site must be identical to what was sent, since the remote site will not be able to distinguish between transport corruption and intentional changes in the original signal. In addition, any transport corruption will destroy the sender's assurance that the remote site is experiencing what is sent, and only what is sent. 3.0	Requirements The Digital Video over IP video must meet the following functional requirements: "	No added intra-frame compression of DV25 video images "	No added inter-frame compression of DV25 video stream "	Output video quality same as input "	Single-cast two-way transmission "	Multi-cast two way transmission "	Two (2) IEEE 1394 ("Fire wire") interfaces "	Support IPv6 "	PCI interface  "	Compatible with Digital Video Transport System (DVTS) software The following equipment and software requirements shall be provided: "	Thirty (30) 21cm PCI Card, IEEE 1394x2, 100BASE-T Xx1 video cards "	Documentation "	Plug and play capability "	Software provided through Internet2 DVIP web site 4.0	Pricing Price quotes received shall include all supporting equipment listed above. 5.0	Maintenance Support The price quote for the Digital Video over IP video cards shall include replacement for defective cards.

<SUBJECT>Meeting regarding acquisition planning for Level 1 weld wire.
<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP)-Mechanicsburg intends to conduct a meeting on June 23, 2004 to discuss acquisition planning of Level 1 weld wire with our industry partners.  Acquisition of Level 1 weld wire is restricted to vendors qualified under various NAVSEA controlled Qualified Product Lists (QPLs).  Vendors on QPLs are qualified to manufacture weld wire of various military specifications and diameters.  There are currently several required items for which there are no qualified vendors.  At this meeting we intend to discuss developing an acquisition strategy with our industry partners that would improve our supply support for our industrial naval activities.

<SUBJECT>--The Government intends to extend the term and expand the dollar threshold of Contract No. DACA31-01-D-0025, an Indefinite Delivery-Type Construction Management Support Contract for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Baltimore District
<DESC>The Government intends to extend the term and expand the dollar threshold of Contract No. DACA31-01-D-0025, an Indefinite Delivery-Type Construction Management Support Contract for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Baltimore District by a tota l of 180 calendar days and $500,000 in order to continue existing services.  This multi-discipline Indefinite Delivery Type Contract (IDTC) was awarded on 10 May 2001 to Alpha Corporation, 21351 Ridgetop Circle, Suite 200, Dulles, VA 20166, for a $1,000,00 0 base period with 2 option periods of $1,000,000 each, for a total of $3,000,000. Under this contract, the majority of the delivery orders issued have been in support of the USACE District of Columbia Public Schools Program.  The services provided under s everal existing task orders need to be extended because the specific projects which these services support have experienced significant and unanticipated schedule delays, which will force the Corps to maintain an extended construction management presence o n these projects.  Furthermore, the construction management support services provided via these instruments are critical to the successful execution of this portion of the program mission.  The personnel currently performing these services have gained subs tantial project specific experience with these particular projects that will be lost if these personnel were to be replaced with others at this juncture.  Therefore, replacement of these personnel with others would result in a substantial duplication of co sts to the Government due to the efforts that would be necessary for new personnel to gain the necessary familiarity with the histories and peculiarities of these projects.  The substantial duplication of costs is not expected to be recovered through compe tition.  Furthermore, at least two of these personnel are involved in projects at critical stages and changing to other support personnel would jeopardize the completion of these projects, resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's require ments.  It is critical to this organization to have these individuals continue in their current roles. Therefore, the USACE Baltimore District is intending to issue a modification to the contract to increase the total contract value from $3,000,000 to $3,5 00,000 and extend the term of the contract by 180 days.  Interested parties should submit requests no later than 4:00pm, 7 June 2004.  Point of Contact is Gary Faykes, gary.faykes@usace.army.mil, (202) 730-3773. This is not a request for proposal.

Solicitation No N5023040045.  is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be awarded as single award contract . SITE VISIT will Be June 4 2004 @ 10:30 am . ALL perspective bidders are STRONGLY URGED to visit the site The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 115310 the size standard is 15 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-05. The solicitation item is as follows: Scope of Work:  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park PROJECT LOCATIONS:  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park is located in the Marietta Metropolitan area.  Developed areas surrounding the park and in holding residential and industrial areas have developed into a Wildland Urban Interface sprawl.  This has created the need to develop defensible fuel breaks to reduce wild fire threats to the park and adjacent properties.  A fuel break 60 feet wide 38,280 feet long will be developed.  The majority of the work will be conducted in the area of the union line, 16th Army Corp.  In this area in particular there is a real possibility that unless the contractor is keenly aware of the earthworks near the areas affected; irreversible damage to the earthworks could be done in completing this contract.  The contractor, along with the national park service historian will be responsible for marking the areas of tree work that will all be done by hand because of it's location on or near the earthworks.  Special attention will have to be paid to these sensitive areas.  Special conditions required in these areas will be described in the contract. New Fuel Break Locations and Lengths Hardage Drive-From roadway northeast 60 feet wide 5280 feet long.  Approximately 1 mile in length.  7.2 acres White Circle Roadway-north and south of roadway 60 feet wide 6600 feet long. South for approximately ¾ of a mile to Old Highway 41 and north for approximately ½ mile to Old Highway 41.  9 acres Gilbert Road-From road southwest 60 feet wide 5280 feet long stretching behind Hardage Farm subdivision.  Approximately 1mile.   7.2 acres Old Mountain Road-northeast 60 feet wide 5280 feet long to a boundary markers behind Greymont subdivision.  Approximately 1mile.   7.2 acres Cheatham Hill Road-working northwest 60 feet wide 5280 feet long to boundary marker.  Approximately 1 mile.    7.2 acres Existing Fuel Break requiring rehabilitation, Locations and Lengths Hardage Farm Subdivision, from roadway north approximately 60 feet wide 3960 feet long. Approximately ¾ of a mile in length.  5.4 acres Hardage Trace Subdivision---Using the established fire road as a break, from Burnt Hickory Road clear approximately 30 feet on each side of the fire road until the road ends and then following the park boundary for a distance of approximately 1 ¼ miles to Dallas Highway.  The existing fuel break is 60 feet wide 6600 feet long.   9 acres Park map is included with this specification detailing location where work is to be completed. SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor shall furnish all equipment, labor, materials, transportation, etc. necessary to remove approximately 52.2 acres of unnaturally heavy fuels accumulations at Kennesaw Mountain Nation Battlefield Park. The work of this contract will consists of removing hazardous trees/fuels build-up which pose a significant safety /fire risk to the public and private homeowners adjacent to the park.  In designated areas all ground fuels within sixty feet of the Park boundary will be removed from the woodlands, bucked, and lopped to manageable lengths and moved from the 60-foot fuel brake.  Trees and brush 6" in diameter or smaller will be cut flush with the ground and removed from the fuel break.   Dead trees that are standing will be cut down and limbed completely.   Trees that have already fallen will be reduced, limbed and laid on the ground.  Where there are high concentrations of large dead trees that have been felled one on the other these will need to be reduced and scattered to prevent continuous large fire fuels. Pruning remaining trees in the fuel break requires branches to be cut at least ten feet from the ground this will interrupt the fire's path.  Pruning cuts should be clean and smooth, avoiding flush cuts and stubs.  All limb wood and slash may be chipped if contractor chooses this as a more cost effective method.   In the event that a chipper cannot reach the area, limb wood and slash will be dragged into the interior of the park and scattered.   With-in these locations are sensitive areas such as historic earthworks.   The contractor is required to be keenly aware of the earthwork areas.  National Park Service historian will mark all earthworks with-in the designated work area.  Work in these areas will be sensitive as not to disturb the historical significance of these resources.  Special care should be taken when cutting and removing trees and brush from earthworks.    INSPECTION CONTROL OF WORK:   An NPS representative will be available to make determinations on any questions of boundary location and tree/brush removal.  Standing dead pine woody material of any DBH will be cut. Much of this will consist of dead pine trees killed by the Southern Pine Beetle.  All limb wood less than 6 inches in diameter from cut material that is not removed may be chipped if the equipment can reach the site.  All material cut under this contract, including logs, firewood, and merchantable pulpwood, shall become the property of the contractor.  If contractor chooses removing vegetation and downed woody material from the park it must be disposed in an approved location.  Much of the work area is not accessible by vehicle or heavy equipment.  Accessibility issues will be discussed with NPS representative and a determination made as to what is accessible to equipment.  For sections of the work site that cannot be reached by equipment, hand removal is required. Larger logs can be cut to manageable lengths and scattered with in fuel brake.  Stump removal and grinding is not included in this contract.  Any material that is chipped will be spread to avoid piles of chips/sawdust. PROJECT OVERVIEW BACKGROUND: Objectives: 1.	Reduce fuel accumulation along the boundary between the Park and subdivision in order to provide adequate defensible space to lessen the risk of wildfire. 2.	Remove heavy concentrations of storm damaged and pine beetle killed fuels from areas adjacent to subdivisions and park motor roads. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: 1.	Cutting restrictions -dead standing timber of any size with-in 60-foot fuel break will be cut and removed as allowed in scope of work. 2.	Equipment restrictions - equipment will be of size and durability to cut, chip and haul woody materials removed from area.  Any equipment used along the wood line shall be low impact type and be used in a manner to restrict damage to the areas.  NO roads or other accessibility points shall be constructed no matter how temporary in nature. 3.	Hauling restrictions:  Units shall not be operated at speeds exceeding the posted limit.  Trucks and other heavy equipment shall be confined to the limits of the project on the park road.  Hauling of materials, supplies, and equipment over the park road, other than within the limits of the project, will not be permitted except as is necessary to perform the required work. 4.	Chipping: Limbwood and slash may be chipped or hauled and removed from the park by the contractor.  If chipping is desired the following constraints will be followed.  (1) All chipped materials will have a depth not to exceed 1 inch.  (2) The chipping location will be changed frequently to achieve a uniform distribution of chips (no piles). (3) Any damage caused by the chipper, wheel ruts, etc. will be rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the COR. 5.

The contractor will be responsible for paying all of the costs associated with the dumping and any fees or fines associated with the hauling and dumping of the removed materials.      6.	Scattering:  This will be done under very controlled conditions and monitored by park staff.   The objective will be to remove the fine fuels from along the boundary so they pose less of a fire hazard.  Fuels must be scattered and not piled to prevent fuel build-ups or "jackpots".  They must be taken at least 50 feet into the interior of the park and then scattered. 7.	Traffic Control: The Chief Ranger will provide if needed all necessary safety and informational signs in areas where contractor's work might come in contact with Park Visitors.  The contractor will erect these signs in advance of the work area before work begins each day.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule.

Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area. The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations. The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times. The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carriers regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas: Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT.

The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights. Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry. The offeror?s proposal shall state the minimum safety and insurance requirements that are required by law and shall provide information that they meet these requirements. Failure to meet this requirement will exclude the offeror from consideration. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerers in descending order of importance: (1) the offerors ability to meet the requirements in the SOW; (2) the offerors strategy to meet scheduled arrival and departure times given the availability of aircraft, flightworthiness of aircraft, etc; (3) an evaluation of past performance; and (4) price. Technical and past performance, when combined, is of significantly higher importance than price in this evaluation. The evaluation criteria can be reviewed by contacting Art Welton at 505-746-5782 or emailing him at art.welton@dhs.gov. The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is HSFLR040023.

It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide technically competent personnel that do not pose background or security concerns. Also, on-time reliability is very important. D. Past Experience:  Provide examples within the last three years of similar air charter service experience(s) that the offeror has provided that have resulted in an ongoing relationship with the customer(s). These examples shall indicate the competency the U.S. Secret Service can expect from the contractor performing the effort.

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

In February of 2004, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, announced his intention to liquidate the Ministry of Communications and form the MCIT.  The new MCIT is intended to become a regulatory body, rather than have responsibility for the commercial communications sector in Azerbaijan as the Ministry of Communications formerly did.  The move is seen as positive, as it will likely increase market-oriented reforms in Azerbaijan and could open up the sector to more private participation.  It is especially important as it moves Azerbaijan closer towards commitments in the telecommunications sector regarding WTO accession.  Yet, there is much need for advice in the legal/regulatory field, including the potential privatization of the state-owned Aztelecom, in order to successfully implement these reforms.  

The economy in Azerbaijan is expected to experience a boom as more oil revenue is realized, and investment in other sectors of the economy increases.  Because a more open telecommunications market in Azerbaijan could hold much potential for U.S. suppliers and service providers, this is an opportune time to provide a DM consultant that can identify current needs in this sector.
