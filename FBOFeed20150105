<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Test Center (AFTC), Services Management Office (SMO), Eglin AFB, FL 32542<br />Description<br />NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) - The AFTC SMO intends to solicit and award a five (5) year Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), to Exelis Inc, 12975 Worldgate Dr Ste 700, Herndon VA 20170. It is anticipated that the new contract will be awarded on or before July 2015.<br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide sustaining engineering services (SES) in support of the B-1 and B-52 mission data (MD) test laboratories and 53d Electronic Warfare Group (53 EWG) Special Test Equipment (STE) located at Eglin Air Force Base Florida. The contractor shall provide SES that will consist of responses to recurring and non-recurring engineering tasks in support of the B-1 and B-52 EW operational test requirements and maintenance/upgrades to STE. Planned taskings will directly support the maintenance, operation and technical capabilities of the AN/ALQ-161 and AN/ALQ-172 and other EW systems mockups and STE for the 53 EWG to include the mobile test facilities (MTFs). This contract includes all 53 EWG B-1 and B-52 specific support equipment (SE) requirements. It also covers the common SE that is used on other platforms, such as the Radar Signal Simulators (RSSs), RF Measurement Test Sets (RFMTS), Robust Analysis and Scoring System (RASS), Integrated Radar Electronic Warfare Test Set (IREWTS), and the Measurement and Verification System (MAVS). The contractor shall provide highly knowledgeable personnel (i.e. must have previous hands-on experience on the hardware design, software coding, integration, and testing of these STE) to perform the necessary work as requested by each task order. Inherent in providing these goods and services, the contractor shall provide the supervision and management effort necessary for the efficient and effective administration and control of the work to be performed. The contractor shall ensure adequate resources are dedicated to satisfy the requirements of work assignments.</p>
<p>An IDIQ contract is anticipated, which may utilize fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contract types. As stated above, it is estimated that the total base contract period of performance will be for five (5) years from time of award. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate for services with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. In accordance with FAR 5.203(a), interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within the response date specified above in order to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Capability statements in response to this synopsis are due by 20 January 2015. <br />The date of response to this synopsis is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication. Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Erika Lingamfelter, Contract Specialist, (850) 882-2675; e-mail erika.lingamfelter@us.af.mil or Lisa Younghanse, Contracting Officer at AFTC/PZZ/PZZC, 102 West D. Avenue, Bldg 11, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495 at (850) 882-0177; e-mail lisa.younghanse@us.af.mil. <br />The Air Force Test Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer identified. For any other concerns, interested parties may call the following Air Force Test Center Ombudsman, Director of Contracts, 5 South Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, (661) 277-2006.<br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) intend to award a follow-on contract to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN to expand the NIOSH Pilot PPE Sentinel Surveillance System. Under a prior NIOSH contract, Vanderbilt University Medical Center developed this system to monitor PPE usage during pandemic events. Therefore, Vanderbilt University has the specialized knowledge required for the efficient expansion of the system. The effort was in support of the programmatic goal to construct a national occupational surveillance system to monitor all PPE and hazards in a variety of work environments. The initial phases of the prior contract focused on respiratory protective devices. The intent of the proposed action is to expand the pilot NIOSH PPE Sentinel Surveillance System to include: (1) 10-15 additional hospitals (including a representative number of the 35 recently announced HHS designated Ebola Treatment Centers) and (2) all types of PPE required for effective Ebola treatment. The objective is to establish a national system to monitor usage and training for PPE used to protect against the Ebola virus based on current CDC recommendations.<br /><br />This contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responses received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government whether or not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive acquisition should be undertaken. Any response should be emailed to Contract Specialist Kate Oyler at ycy4@cdc.gov by 4:00 p.m. EST, January 21, 2015.

<DESC>This is a Market Survey announcement.  This Market Survey is being released in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management Policy (AMS) policy 3.2.1.2.1.  The responses to this Market Survey will be used for information purposes only and will not be released, except under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked.  This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  If the FAA decides to conduct an open competition, only responses to this market survey will be considered to meet the immediate need for an additional Geostationary Earth Orbiting Satellite.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request For Proposal (RFP). The FAA is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.

All parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs associated with any response received in response to this announcement.  Any costs associated with the Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested partyâ€™s expense.  Responses to this Market Survey will be used to develop a Source List which will be used if a solicitation for this requirement is issued.  
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The Government has identified the principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code) 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 750.  If you believe that another NAICS code can be responsive to the work specified in this market survey, include supporting justification with your alternate NAICS code.  Suggestion of an alternate NAICS code does not require that the work be set-aside or solicited under that alternative code.
The FAA must maintain and sustain the existing Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Program Satellite Communication Segment.  The WAAS Program Satellite Communications Segment consists of three Geostationary Earth Orbiting (GEO) satellite systems and associated uplink and control capability.  Each GEO satellite system consists of the Geostationary Uplink Subsystem (GUS) and the GEO Satellite Payload (GSP).  The GUS interfaces with the WAAS system through a government furnished Signal Generator Subsystem (SGS).  The GUS provides the Radio Frequency Uplink (RFU) to the GSP with the WAAS broadcast messages.  The GSP converts the uplink frequency to L-band for Earth coverage re-transmission.
   
This Market Survey seeks industry input to identify industryâ€™s ability to provide the desired functional capabilities for one or more future GEO satellite lease requirements.  Information collected will be used to validate when operational service-based operations might be available and the benefits and risks in obtaining those services.  Responses to this Market Survey will be factored into investment decisions regarding the acquisition of satellite communication services.
You are invited to submit documentation addressing the following items: 

1.	Does your company expect to participate in the launch and operation of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites over North America between 2017 and 2022? The orbital arc of interest for the FAA is from 115 to 137 degrees West longitude, with a strong preference for 119 to 129 degrees West longitude. 
1.1	Identify the orbital locations for the candidate satellite(s).
1.2	Identify satellite builder, payload builder and the state of development in context of the development cycle for any candidate satellites. Please provide any written letter from satellite provider indicating its intent to build the satellite (e.g. board approval of business case and authorization to secure satellite builder), if available. 
1.3	Identify space and power availability on candidate satellites for adding an L-band navigation transponder payload (Global Positioning System (GPS) L-band frequencies L1 & L5) with signal conversion from the planned uplink frequency. Historical transponder uplink has been C-band with onboard C-to L-band conversion.  Use of uplink frequencies other than C-band uplink frequency could be acceptable provided they meet equivalent downlink L-Band performance. The use of L-band for the transponder payload will remain. 
1.4	Identify the End-Of-Life (EOL) projection(s) for candidate satellites currently planned (or already in-orbit, if applicable), and the associated satellite restoration philosophy.
1.5	Identify if this satellite will replace an existing on-orbit satellite or if it is going to a new orbital location.  
1.6	Identify assurances or conditions associated with keeping the satellite/transponder available for FAA use for the full duration of a 10 year lease term in the assigned orbital arc.

2.	Describe the experience your company has on the architecture, design, construction, testing, launch, In-Orbit-Test (IOT), and integration of satellite communications systems.

3.	Describe the experience your company has on specialized L-band transponders (preferably C-band uplink), including but not limited to:
3.1	Experience in architecture definition and design of L-band transponders;
3.2	Experience in design, construction and payload integration of L-band antennas;
3.3	Experience with onboard payload hosting; and
3.4	Experience with the signal fidelity aspects associated with navigation quality ranging signal generation.

4.	If your company designs, constructs and/or operates GUS,  
4.1	Describe GUS site implemented; to include location(s) and satellite(s) used; and
4.2	Describe how implementation was accomplished (in-house or via contractors). 
4.3	Propose GUS sites for any candidate satellite along with the high level design approach for each site.

5.	Would your company consider making capital investments for the design, construction, integration, and launch of specialized L-band transponders which will be utilized for navigation quality ranging signals?  If so, what would be the percentage investment relative to the total navigation transponder cost?

6.    Identify the payload development contract award date necessary to support your candidate satelliteâ€™s expected on-orbit operations.
6.1	Define and state any payload development risks or opportunities associated with the intended technical, performance, cost, or schedule approach.  Identify any differences based on percentage of direct investment.  
6.2	Define your Risk Mitigation approach for assuring the payload would meet the FAAâ€™s WAAS GEO requirements.

All information provided in response to this request is subject to release under the FOIA.  Therefore, please clearly and properly mark all documentation you consider proprietary.  All information not identified as proprietary will be used at the FAAâ€™s discretion and may be publicly released without further review.
  
The FAA may provide you an opportunity to discuss your response in person.  Please indicate as part of your response to this Market Survey if you would like to schedule such a one-on-one session to discuss your input.  Please also identify your preferred times and dates for your session.  The FAA may choose to accommodate all or none of the requested sessions depending on the demand for these sessions and whether or not they can be accommodated within a reasonable amount of time.

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. 

In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

1.  Capability Statement - This document should identify:
â€¢Type of services provided by your firm.
â€¢Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance).
â€¢Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services.
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.)  Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

The FAA will consider any cost information provided in a market survey response.

Interested parties must submit a response by 2PM Eastern Daylight Time, January 16, 2015.  Responses must be delivered via email to: Samantha.E.Williams@faa.gov

Please remember, all costs associated with the preparation and submission of responses is the responsibility of the responding sources.  The FAA will not reimburse any costs associated with this Market Survey.

Please direct any requests for clarification regarding this Market Survey to Samantha E. Williams, Contracting Officer.  Phone number (202)267-9653.

Thank you for participating in this Market Survey.

<p>It is the intent of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to issue a sole source solicitation to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon), 225 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA, 01801-1060, to develop follow-on requirements for its X-Band Radars.&nbsp; These radars include the Army Navy Transportable Radar Surveillance (AN/TPY-2), Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX), and the Ground Based Radar Prototype (GBR-P).&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirements include X-Bands Software and Hardware Development, limited Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) maintenance, Engineering Services, Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Flight and Ground Test Planning, Execution and Analysis across all the X-Band Radars.&nbsp; MDA anticipates acquiring this acquisition through a developmental Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract through 31 October 2017.</p>
<p>The proposed contract modification will be executed on a sole source basis to Raytheon IDS pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), as the resulting contract modification is for highly specialized supplies and services where it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.&nbsp; Raytheon has been the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) for more than 20 years.&nbsp; A contract was awarded to Raytheon in September 1992, as a result of a full and open competition for the Strategic and Theater Demonstration/Validation of a Ground-Based Radar.&nbsp; In FY2000, Raytheon was awarded a subcontract under Lockheed Martin contract DASG60-00-C-0072 for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) X-Band Radar (AN/TPY-2).&nbsp; In April 2003, Raytheon was awarded a prime contract (HQ0006-03-C-0047) for the production and further development of the AN/TPY-2 radar.&nbsp; Under contracts HQ0006-01-C-0001 and follow-on contract HQ0147-09-C-0008 for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) System, Raytheon was awarded subcontracts by the prime (Boeing) for the design and development of the X-Band Radar on the SBX Vessel.&nbsp; Under contract HQ0147-08-D-0001, Raytheon previously provided test support for the GBR-P Radar.&nbsp; Under the current contract (HQ0147-12-D-0005) Raytheon is the prime contractor for the scope of work required.&nbsp; As the product developer of the MDA X-Band radars since 1992, Raytheon has unique technical expertise to meet the aforementioned agency requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact the Raytheon Contract Manager, Ms. Jill Asimakopoulos, at 339-645-1347. Point of contact for the MDA is Ms. Marie Agrinzoni, Procuring Contracting Officer, at 256-450-4829.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit, within 15 days after publication of this notice, a capability statement, proposal, or quotation that shall be considered by MDA.&nbsp; A determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Materials Measurement Science Division, Material Measurement Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA 92606, for the purchase of the Newport SmartTable OTS Optical Table and GuideStar II beam stabilization Systems and associated components, to be located at NIST, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD.
<p><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The Material Measurement Laboratory's Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Group (MMRG) conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale heterosystems analysis. Measurement techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, inorganic and biomolecular systems where materials of interest are typically present as either micro/nano-scale features or monolayer/multilayer films. To meet NIST's mission; the MMRG requires an active, Laser stabilization and isolation platform (also referred to as a Newport vibration isolation platform with GuideStar beam stabilization) to improve performance of existing critical laser systems.</p>
<p>The required Newport SmartTable OTS Optical Table and GuideStar II beam stabilization systems and associated components along with NIST's pre-existing Newport SmartTable OTS Optical vibration isolation platform will form a tuned, active vibration isolation system. Pin-to-pin compatibility with controllers and other active elements are essential to keep the system matched/tuned and to maintain a high level of vibration isolation.

<CONTACT>Sheila R. Edmonds, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014966546, Email sheila.edmonds@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a presolicitation/notice of intent to sole source for commercial services prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research (OBSSR) to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Elsevier Ltd., The Boulevard, Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford, United Kingdom OX51GB under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) to provide the OBSSR with Promotional Access of the Special Issue on Education and Health in the Journal of Social Science &amp; Medicine (SSM). The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 511120- Periodical Publishers with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br />
<p>Mission/Vision</p>
<p>OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation.</p>
<p>OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary "team science" that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis - from cells to society - required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In 2003, OBSSR spearheaded a bold scientific initiative to encourage the research community to answer the question: "What are the causal pathways/mechanisms that may explain the apparent positive statistical relationship between educational attainment and health?" As a result of this initiative, OBSSR funded thirteen (13) grants which directly contributed to dozens of original peer reviewed scientific papers on the subject of Education and Health. A history of the 2003 effort and its results can be found at:<br />http://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific_areas/social_culture_factors_in_health/health_disparities/index.aspx</p>
<p>In 2014, OBSSR revisited the above question by convening a meeting of scholars and science stakeholders to summarize the lessons learned and possible new directions and unanswered questions that need to be addressed in order to improve the scientific understanding and advance the literature. A formal science report of that meeting can be read here: http://obssr.od.nih.gov/pdf/OBSSR_Education_and_Health_REV_8-22-2014_FINAL_RLA.pdf</p>
<p>The journal's open access will expand the leadership and possible research interest in the BSSR Education and Health research topic that spans both the behavioral/social sciences in addition to the clinical and health sciences.</p>
<p>Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of the requirement is for a Contractor to assist OBSSR with providing Promotional Access of the Special Issue on Education and Health in the Journal of Social Science &amp; Medicine (SSM) to subscribers and non-subscribers of SSM. This effort will promote research excellence and knowledge development in this area of research which coincides with OBSSR's mission of facilitating the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research.</p>
<p>Impact of the Special Issue</p>
<p>SSM has an impact factor of 2.558, and is regularly in the top 25 read public health journals (http://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine/). Open access to this special issue will also allow SSM and NIH to distribute the journal far beyond its normal circulation pattern.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks</p>

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has a requirement to retrofit its current inventory of up to 423 PEQ-1Cs to provide an enhanced laser designating capability without investing SOCOM funds to procure an entirely new system. The purpose of this effort is to reutilize material from the laser designator systems currently in USSOCOM's inventory to provide an enhanced laser designating capability without investing SOCOM funds to procure an entirely new system. The system resulting from this retrofit process will henceforth be referred to as the Mini Special Operations Forces Laser Marker (SOFLAM).<br />The Government expects to negotiate and award this requirement on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, to Northrop Grumman (NG) Laser Systems, Apopka, FL. The PEQ-IC Is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) for which the Government does not own data rights. The Contractor, NG, developed and owns the data rights for the data rights for this system. The kits being developed under this effort to retrofit the PEQ-1C to a mini SOFLAM cannot be procured competitively without the use of a level three technical data package which details form, fit, function, material, assembly, interfaces and manufacturing processes. After evaluation of the responses received to the RFI issued 10 September 2014, USSOCOM has determined that the cost of procuring the data is not expected to be recovered through competition. This requirement is a one-time upgrade for a specific number of units and there will be no further need for this type of modification.<br />Parties that feel they can meet this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves. While this notice is not a request for competitive proposal, the Government will consider all bids, proposals, quotations, and capability statements received. Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via email to Ms. Indira R. Phillips, Contract Specialist, Phone (813) 826-0320, Email <a href="mailto:indira.phillips@socom.mil">indira.phillips@socom.mil</a>.<br /><br />

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research to determine the availability of medical countermeasures that mitigate the effects of multi-drug resistant bacterial infections by biological agents in DoD personnel.   <br>  <br> Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL or ANY of the requirements listed below. Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. If candidates are interested in teaming with other sources, please include in your response authorization to release your company's name, area of interest, and POC information to be made available on a public website. All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br>  <br> The JPdM Biological Defense Therapeutics (BDTx) Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) Joint Project Management Office focuses on the advanced development of adaptable platform technologies and broad-spectrum medical countermeasures (MCMs) to counter emerging, genetically engineered, or unknown threats. JPdM BDTX Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops therapeutics for Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) that cannot be mitigated by existing MCMs. <br>  <br> Background: <br> To ensure Warfighter capability-in the face of the continuing emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria and advancements in biotechnology that enable development of genetically engineered, drug resistant bacteria-there is a need to identify new classes of antibacterial compounds and new bacterial targets. Accordingly, the goal of the CMDR-B program is to develop long-term, broad-spectrum therapeutic solutions to defeat antibiotic resistant BWAs. <br> Interested parties should fully describe their medical countermeasure (therapeutic) and provide all available information with respect to criteria A-M below. If an MCM candidate meets only some of the criteria, a portion of a criterion, or otherwise has capabilities not specifically called out by the criteria, JPdM BDTX still strongly encourages a response to this RFI so that a more complete understanding of the state-of-the-art may be obtained. MCMs developed by the commercial sector, academia, the United States Government, and international entities are acceptable. <br>  <br> Submission Instructions: <br> All responses must be submitted electronically to jeremy.d.michaels.civ@mail.mil within fifteen (15) days of issuance of this RFI. Address any question regarding this RFI, in writing, to the above.  Submissions must: <br> (1)	Use Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (text searchable format) using single-space, 12-point font and printable on 8.5 x 11 size white paper, with margins no less than 1 quote mark  at the top, bottom, and sides;  <br> (2)	Include technical and administrative points of contact, with names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses in the cover page; and  <br> (3)	 Not exceed ten single-sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter). Responses shall be organized to provide concise information to respond directly to the points given in the A-M criteria (as listed above) in the order shown. Respondents may include additional information, such as supporting test reports or pertinent journal articles as desired. However, the ten-page response shall stand-alone from the additional information, and shall describe the technology without reference to the additional information. The additional information, if any, shall be separately labeled from the response, and removable from the ten-page response without any loss of understanding to the ten-page response. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired. .  <br> The respondent must also provide their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, size and type of business (e.g. large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements. <br>  <br> Please submit in accordance to Attchment titled RFI CMDR-B.

<DESC>The Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) has been established through the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) in conjunction with the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the Office of the Director (OD). The CBC is a multidisciplinary network comprised of academic, government and private entities that interacts collaboratively to support execution of drug discovery and development projects within the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Program (NExT). The CBC centers along with DCTD's existing resources, establishes a complete drug discovery and development platform for oncology therapeutics. One critical infrastructure resource within the CBC is small molecule screening library services in support of high-throughput screening (HTS) projects. The CBC Screening Libraries Center (CBCSLC) provides this resource capability. The CBCSLC was originally established in 2010 under the name Chemical Biology Consortium Small Molecule Repository (CBCSMR). The CBCSLC will be responsible for the storage, distribution, replenishment and expansion of our current 130,000 compound small molecule screening library and providing associated infrastructure, technical and informatics services.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Program Executive Office - Mission Assurance (PEO-MA), is seeking information from industry to assist with the development and planning of a potential new requirement, to determine sources with competencies <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">to provide solutions/capabilities for </span>Next Generation <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">End Point Security System requirements. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: "><span style="COLOR: red">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">OVERVIEW:</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is seeking responses from both large and small businesses (including the following subsets, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUBZone Firms; Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) describing capabilities meeting or exceeding listed desired capabilities. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541511, 541512, 541513, 541519, all with the corresponding size standard of $25,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: SV">The purpose is to communicate to Industry DISA's vision of endpoint security and discover capabilities to strengthen the posture of the endpoint. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This RFI document defines endpoint types and requests industry's response to achieving effective and efficient tools protecting against advanced persistent threats and where they are effective in the kill chain model discussed below. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In additon, DISA has interest in a management tool that can provide effective management on multiple endpoint Operating Systems (OS) for endpoints types described below. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: SV">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: SV">A holistic response to all requirements is not required and it is preferred that responses are on core capability of vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DISA is looking for innovative approaches with a product or product family that can mitigate against persistent threats and their common attack patterns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DISA is interested in novel approaches to the problem of end-point security; the solutions presented do not need to be similar to current solutions employed by the government or approaches implied by the collective set of requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DISA is also interested in innovative combinations of technology that provide the necessary protection, detection, response and recovery for an end-point with the smallest overall footprint and lowest cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: SV">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: SV">SCOPE OF EFFORT</span>:</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The endpoint has evolved to <span>encompass a complex hybrid environment of desktops, laptops, mobile devices, </span><em>virtual endpoints</em><span>, servers, and infrastructure, involving both public and private clouds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>New technologies - including those for virtualization, workforce mobility, and Cloud services - are changing the way we conceptualize the desktop. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DISA is requesting responses for innovative solutions to provide security services in heavily virtualized environments that provide economies over replicating security services in each virtual endpoint. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Traditional approaches have used signature based defenses; however these methods have become un-scalable. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Responses detailing how the vendor treats the different endpoint types are desired. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As we build our cyber security strategy for endpoints it merits an assessment of the changing environment and our changing fiscal circumstances. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Assessing available OS security tools and determining enhancements to those tools is one of our objectives. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>To achieve our endpoint security objectives we will need capabilities that do not interfere with anti-exploitation features of the OS on which they run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISA is interested in capabilities having light weight agents or agentless <strong>to minimize the footprint on virtual machines. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DISA is also interested in the integration depth to the hypervisor that could allow inspection of a virtual machine's hardware files and components in real-time.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The DoD enterprise is estimated near four million endpoints and vendor capabilities will be required to scale. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Providing proven scalability in the response is desired. </strong><strong></strong></p>

<a href="mailto:samantha.l.connors.civ@mail.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  <br>  <br> This notice is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, particularly small businesses, prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a solicitation. <br>  <br> The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is seeking firms capable of providing laboratory, vivarium, and aquatics support for the US Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR). The contractor will provide research, technical, and scientific administrative support to programs conducted by USACEHR. <br>  <br> The Contractor may perform searches of the technical literature and may be requested to provide support in document acquisition and translation. The Contractor shall participate in development and preparation of research scopes of work, animal-use and research protocols and standing operating procedures as needed in the planning and execution of research projects. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall perform laboratory procedures, testing and research protocols in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology and toxicology (toxicogenomics), toxicology, biomarkers of exposure and effects, aquatic biology, biomonitoring and remote monitoring of contaminated areas, fate and effects of environmental contaminants, exposure assessment, human and ecological risk assessment and model development, and other related areas. Methods may be of a routine nature or may involve specialized procedures. A part of the research may consist of the development of new procedures or methods. The Contractor shall perform maintenance of laboratory animals and cellular organisms at USACEHR facilities. Specific expertise in maintenance and husbandry of rodent, aquatic and amphibian species maintained by USACEHR is required. <br>  <br> In situations in which the Contractor is required to work on-site, a part of USACEHR laboratory space and office space will be identified for Contractor use. Where practicable, and not otherwise addressed, Contractor staff also shall have equipment and facilities dedicated to their use only. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall prepare, edit and complete technical reports, manuscripts, annual reports and other technical documents, including oral reporting and briefing materials, as required. The Contractor shall review intramural and extramural technical research proposals, reports, manuscripts, and other scientific documents as requested. This may require the ability to generate detailed graphics and to utilize other current audio-visual presentation software and technologies. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) may be required to support specialized taskings. As SME services are required for these taskings, the contractor shall be provided with a PWS that identifies the specific requirements. <br>  <br> USACEHR is developing new and novel approaches to assessing the nature and extent of contamination of the environment. The development and application of mammalian and non-mammalian hazard assessment models coupled with analytical chemistry data provide for an integrated biological assessment of the presence of hazards to both human and ecological receptors. The development and application of this technology is facilitated by an effective review and sharing of the information with DoD program managers, extramural contractors, industry, other government agencies, academic institutions and the public at large. There are many products by which the progress and results of the USACEHR research program may be summarized and disseminated. The Contractor shall provide for all elements of intramural research management, technology transfer and marketing, but the focus is support of ongoing efforts in biomarker discovery, animal husbandry, and development of Tier 2 assays for endocrine disrupting chemicals. <br>  <br> USACEHR conducts research, development, testing and evaluation activities that involve the use of a number of mammalian and non-mammalian aquatic species as animal models. This research requires the establishment, maintenance and renewal of mammalian and aquatic organism cultures, operation of testing facilities for exposure to chemical toxicants under a variety of conditions, to include injection, inhalation, and operation of a water treatment facility to ensure that culture and test waters are of uniform and acceptable quality. All routine activities, including preparation of periodic reports, are performed according to USACEHR standing operating procedures (SOPs). Coordinate and schedule organism colony renewals and husbandry to provide sufficient organisms to meet the needs of researchers. Provide periodic (e.g., monthly) reports on the status of all mammalian and aquatic organisms. Facility operation must meet accreditation requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).  Organisms to be maintained include but are not limited to mice, rats, medaka, bluegill, zebrafish, fathead minnows, Xenopus frogs, killifish, daphnids and algae. Duties include feeding the organisms and maintaining live food sources (e.g., microworms, algae and brine shrimp), tank and glassware cleaning, maintenance and housekeeping in animal rooms, set-up and take-down of tanks, ordering supplies and equipment in a timely fashion to prevent shortages, shipping and receiving organisms and providing proper quarantine procedures, developing new aquaculture procedures as needed, and fabricating simple items such as specialty test chambers. Use of some equipment such as a plate glass cutter or drill for glass tanks or rubber stoppers is required. Monitor operation of well water facilities and notify maintenance staff immediately of malfunctions. Conduct daily, weekly or other periodic water quality sampling and measurement as required, using wet chemical methods or water quality equipment, such as meters, probes and recording devices to measure parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, ammonia, alkalinity and hardness. As needed, construct, operate and maintain the aquatic toxicity testing facility fixtures and equipment, including apparatus such as flow-through proportional diluters, peristaltic pumps, etc. Assist in toxicity test operation and maintenance. Modify tanks or adapt specialized equipment to toxicity testing needs. Clean tanks and equipment to remove chemicals used in testing. Facility maintenance must meet AAALAC requirements. <br>  <br> USACEHR is developing new toxicity test models. In one approach, USACEHR is attempting to identify molecular biomarkers that are indicative of toxic chemical exposure using zebrafish, several mammalian cell culture models and rat models of toxicity. The availability of well-characterized biomarkers in these model organisms will enable the Army to evaluate new chemicals for possible toxic effects and to test potentially contaminated environments for the presence of toxic hazards for humans and other organisms. Both proteomic and genomic technologies are being utilized in this effort. All routine activities, including preparation of periodic reports, are performed according to USACEHR SOPs. Carry out largely independent research projects to identify novel biomarkers of exposure and effect using one or more of the above model systems. Develop new laboratory methods and adapt existing techniques to the equipment and project at hand. Perform sophisticated molecular studies on RNA, DNA and proteins extracted from liver, gill and other tissues of the above model organisms. Maintain notebooks and databases of all experiments and be responsible for data interpretation and statistical analysis. Prepare presentations for laboratory and scientific meetings; prepare manuscripts for presentation of results in scientific journals from experimentation, and assist co-authors in papers containing his/her significant contributions. Access and utilize the scientific literature to establish and modify methods, support protocol preparation and approval, design studies, and prepare manuscripts and presentations. The development of the new toxicity test models involves and using them to conduct exposure experiments that involve genomic and proteomic evaluations in addition to determination of the physiologic effects of the exposures. Protocols are developed for zebrafish, mammalian cell culture models, and rodents. For zebrafish, gene expression analyses are done using Agilent or Affymetrix microarrays; Affymetrix GeneChips are used for all the other model systems. Proteomic analyses make use of a combination of electrophoresis, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Conduct literature searches for test chemicals, evaluate analytical methods for utility in our experiments, evaluate the behavior of the test chemicals under our test conditions, and determine the appropriate designs for chemical replenishment during the exposure experiments. Be responsible for proteomic analyses of samples from exposure experiments. Develop and apply microscopic evaluation methods and other physiologic measurements for evaluation of effects of exposures. Assist with conduct of exposure experiments. Assist with gene expression analyses when needed. <br>  <br> USACEHR has collected data from numerous research protocols that must be prepared for publication in peer reviewed journals. Contractor is requested to provide expertise in the form of a technical writer to assist in the preparation of manuscripts to be submitted for publication. The contractor will have experience in preparing manuscripts and will possess the necessary skill set to understand the collected data (ie: comprehension of scientific work performed--see work descriptions above), organize the data in an appropriate format, prepare descriptive narrative in appropriate format, and edit the manuscript. <br>  <br> Key personnel for this requirement is expected to include, but not be limited to: <br>  <br> Animal care and laboratory technician <br> Aquaculture specialist <br> Molecular biologist / biomarker scientist <br> Molecular biologist / transcriptomics scientist <br>  <br> The Government anticipates a single indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with a Period of Performance of one (1) twelve-month base period plus four (4) twelve-month option periods. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest. It is requested that all interested parties submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length) demonstrating its ability to perform the requested services and prior experience with similar requirements.  <br>  <br> Responses are due on Monday, January 12, 2015 by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  <br>  <br> The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.  <br>  <br> Capabilities statements must be submitted electronically to SAMANTHA.L.CONNORS.CIV@MAIL.MIL <br>  <br> Questions regarding this notice should be addressed to Samantha L.

<DESC>This publication satisfies the requirement at FAR Part 5 and constitutes the Government's notice of extension of Contract Number W912CN-08-C-0085 for a period not exceeding six months beginning on 01 March 2015 on a non-competitive basis. This extension was accomplished under the authority of FAR Clause 52.217-8, Extension of Services, on a sole source basis, as authorized by FAR Part 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br>  <br> The 413th Contracting Support Brigade at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii extended contract W912CN-08-C-0085 with BAE Technology Solutions and Services Inc., 1601 Research Blvd., Rockville MD, 20850, on a sole source basis, for Logistics Support Services in support of the Logistics Readiness Center in Hawaii. The period of performance for this extended period is 1 March 2015 through 31 August 2015. The major functional areas of operations and support are Materiel Maintenance, Transportation, and Supply Services.   <br>  <br> This extension is necessary as the follow on contract is temporarily on hold pending resolution of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) protest.   <br>  <br> The LRC requires logistical support services for all organizations, subordinate units, non-USARPAC activities and respective  military organizations, to include the Active Army (including a Stryker Brigade), U.S. Army Reserves, U.S. Army National Guard, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), Junior ROTC, American Samoa, Guam, Saipan, National Training Centers, and all USARPAC, USAG-HI, and other organizations (assigned, attached, or tenant), within the Hawaii geographical area of responsibility.   <br>  <br> This synopsis is not considered a request for bid/quote/proposal.

FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet. Please feel free to use the FBO site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTICE - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): The Government is issuing this RFI as part of a market survey in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to determine the potential sources and technical capability of industry to provide Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division information about industry ability to provide a Cartridge Shot Counter (CSC).<br /><br />The General requirements for the CSC are listed below with more specific requirements listed in the attached performance specification (PS-JXNL-F15-0020): <br /><br />CSC is a system of components that detect and record shots fired, cadence of fire, and possible other maintenance specific data for family of weapons (pistols, carbines, rifles, machine guns, and precision rifles). The CSC will read all passive tag identification on barrels and various ancillary attachments (Scopes, Lasers, and Flashlights Etc...). The capability is sought for all family of weapons configurations. <br /><br />Data Collection Device (DCD). A Data Collection Device (DCD) will be used to read the Item Unique Identification (IUID) of the weapon and ancillary attachments, store and transmit this information to the CSC (located on the weapon). It will also read and the record shots fired, cadence of fire, and possible other weapon history details such as barrel temperature. The DCD will also transfer data while sitting in and charging in the DCD cradle connected via USB 3 (compatible to USB 2.0) to the Weapon Enhanced Arms Repair (WEAR) maintenance software loaded on a NMCI Standard seat and/or a SOCOM Standard Seat. The DCD serves three purposes: Identification of the Host weapon and ancillary attachments with IUIDs transfer IUIDs information to CSC, the retrieve data from the CSC and transfer of all data to and from the WEAR maintenance system. The DCD is not the primary means by which data from the CSC will be displayed to the armorer, as WEAR will serve this function. The DCD will be a stand-alone device that is independent of a laptop or desktop computer. When connected to a laptop or desktop computer via USB DCD Cradle, data can be uploaded into WEAR.<br /><br />WEAR maintenance system. Recording round count and rate of fire are only part of the desired capability. Without comparing such information to weapon part reliability data, knowledge of round count has little use. The WEAR Maintenance System completes the required objective. WEAR provides the armorer with the number of rounds to replacement for a given part or assembly. It also serves as an electronic maintenance log, enabling the armorer to record when a part has been replaced and the reason for replacement. Based on the statistical life expectancy of parts within a weapon, WEAR can give some indication as to the overall "health" of a weapon as well. WEAR was developed for and with input from family of weapons armorers. WEAR will upload from the computer to the Special Warfare Automated Logistics Information System (SWALIS).SWALIS will allow logisticians to monitor weapon component history. WEAR will be Government-owned and controlled at the completion of the contract, allowing for continued open architecture for future CSC capabilities and integration with other military and DOD databases. The Contractor is responsible for providing the CSC within the attached performance specification (PS-JXNL-F15-0020).

<DESC><br /><strong>ORNL Sustainable Transportation Program Technical Assistance for US Small Businesses in Vehicle Technologies<br /></strong>
<p><br />Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is announcing a pilot Technical Assistance Program to help a limited number of American-owned U.S. small businesses commercialize clean transportation technologies.  This opportunity will provide selected participants access to ORNL's experienced staff and unique equipment and capabilities in support of the participants' sustainable transportation research and development activities.</p>
<p><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, conducts research and development in support of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  Through its Sustainable Transportation Program (STP), EERE advances the development of next-generation technologies to improve plug-in electric and other alternative-fuel vehicles, advanced combustion engine and vehicle efficiency, and produce low-carbon domestic fuels.</p>
<p>ORNL invites applications from small businesses to participate in this pilot Technical Assistance Program.  Projects will be selected based on the criteria described below and will provide up to approximately 40 hours of ORNL staff effort and the necessary facilities and supplies.  Companies must provide at least 50% cost share, which can be funds-in to ORNL or in-kind contributions (e.g., facilities, services, and staff time).  Company cost share cannot be met using funds from U.S. Government sources. Funds will not be provided to the company by ORNL. Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT REQUEST.</p>
<p><strong>Objective<br /></strong><br />The objective of this pilot program is to help small businesses commercialize clean and efficient transportation technologies by providing technical assistance or information. Examples of available assistance and information include<br />&bull;	Test and measurement of systems or components<br />&bull;	Analytical testing and characterization of materials<br />&bull;	Advising on processing or manufacturing concerns and resolving related technical problems<br />&bull;	Advising on emerging products or processes<br />&bull;	Assistance in addressing general technology performance</p>

<p><br /><strong>Selection Criteria<br /></strong><br />&bull;	Applications will be considered on a first come, first served basis.<br />&bull;	Projects must take advantage of unique ORNL assets and proposed work must not be able to be reasonably performed by entities in the private sector.<br />&bull;	ORNL staff and equipment time must be available to perform the work.<br />&bull;	Projects must specifically address commercialization or market barriers.<br />&bull;	Projects must be technically sound and aligned with the&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><a href="http://energy.gov/eere/vehicles/vehicle-technologies-office">DOE Vehicle Technologies</a></span>&nbsp;mission.<br />&bull;	Selections will be contingent on availability of funds.</p>
<p><strong>Process<br /></strong><br />Applications will be reviewed by a team comprising ORNL business and research professionals and will be approved by the ORNL STP Director with DOE/HQ concurrence.  Each approved application for a project will be finalized and carried out through a&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/File%20Library/Main%20Nav/ORNL/Partnerships/Sponsored%20Research/DOE-483Short-Form-CRADA-6-13.pdf">Short Form Model Cooperative Research And Development Agreement</a></span>&nbsp;(CRADA) signed by ORNL and the participating company.<br />Work can begin once the CRADA is fully executed.  A final letter report, accompanied by an abstract that is suitable for public release, will be generated for each project.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property and Proprietary Data<br /></strong><br />DOE and ORNL respect the importance of industry's intellectual property and data security while balancing the need to document the benefits of public expenditures. Provisions relating to proprietary information and intellectual property are set forth in the CRADA. A Non-Disclosure agreement (NDA), if required, can be put into place during development of the project to facilitate discussions while protecting the company's proprietary information.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, it is preferred that proprietary information NOT be included in the application. If company proprietary information is included in the application, the specific information should be marked as such, and UT-Battelle/ORNL will treat that information as business confidential.</p>
<p><strong>CRADA Information<br /></strong><br />Awardees are expected to enter into a CRADA with UT-Battelle. Because of the need for accelerated placement and execution of the projects, the most favorable terms allowable within DOE guidelines have been established and will not be subject to negotiation. Failure to enter into a CRADA in a timely manner will result in termination of further project consideration. CRADAs have provisions that address the protection of the participants' existing proprietary information and intellectual property, as well as the information and intellectual property generated and made during the collaboration. More specifically, each party owns its own inventions while jointly made inventions will be jointly owned. In all cases, the U.S. Government will retain government use rights. Proprietary data used in performing the work may be protected for a period of five years.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Information<br /></strong><br />DOE is providing funding through the ORNL Sustainable Transportation Program and will support ORNL staff and equipment costs for a period of up to approximately 40 hours per project. Participating companies are responsible for a minimum of 50% cost share, which can be funds-in to ORNL or in-kind contributions (e.g., facilities, services, and staff time).  Company cost share cannot be met using funds from U.S. Government sources.</p>

<DESC>Access to markets and basic social services is a key determinant of poverty. Without physical access, rural communities face far greater obstacles in obtaining wealth, health, education, and other social services. In addition, their ability to take advantage of surplus crop production and of employment opportunities is severely constrained. The permanent or seasonal absence of road access in most parts of rural Liberia is a constraining factor in terms of providing rural communities with essential services such as education, primary health care, water supply, local markets and economic opportunities. The availability of such services and opportunities are difficult to sustain without a good quality and well-maintained rural road network.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 
508-15-1-5103-0062

A.	GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.  Title of Project:  Specialty Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and positron emission tomography (PET) Services for the VA Rehabilitation Research &Development Center for Visual and Neurocognitive Rehabilitation's Research Projects

2.  Scope of Work:  
The VA RR&D Center for Visual and Neurocognitive Rehabilitation (CVNR) has multiple funded research projects that require fMRI scanning services and specialized companion equipment and software to successfully carry out their research protocols. The objective is to acquire the use of this specialized equipment and services to operate the equipment, and to have this facility within 20 minutes of the Atlanta VA Medical Center.   The research participants will need to commute between the scanning facility and the VA research labs frequently. 

3.  Background:  
This is a contractual service agreement that has historically been between VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Center of Excellence and the Emory University for the use of 3 Tesla (3T) Siemen's MRI scans. VA Central Office has funded the following Research Projects which require the services in this contract:
"	Grant # C9246C "Rehabilitation Research and Development Center of Excellence Grant" ;PI: Krish Sathian, MD, PhD (multiple projects and pilot projects)
"	Grant # B7676P "Brain Activations in Humans"; PI: Andrew Butler, PhD
"	Grant # B0994P "Right Frontal Activity in Older Adults: Does It Help or Hurt Word Retrieval?"; PI: Bruce Crosson, PhD
"	Grant # B8034 "Aerobic Exercise and Cognitive Training in Older Adults"; PI: Joe Nocera, PhD
"	Grant # E0596W "Effects of Exercise Intervention on Aging Related Motor Decline (AGING)"; PI: Keith McGregor, PhD
"	Grant # N0870W "Optimizing Motor Training in Parkinson Disease through Neural Mechanisms"; PI: Madeleine Hackney, PhD
"	Any other projects for CVNR investigators and/or career development awardees that are funded or may become funded during the period of this contract.

Data Management:  The contractor will perform MRI scans on research subjects. Each research subject will be issued, by the VA research staff, a code which will be entered into the scanner computer instead of a name. The key to the code is kept locked in a filing cabinet the locked office of the Principal Investigator. In addition, the "date of birth" appears in the scanner program as well. To avoid using the research participants actual date of birth, 1/1 for the month and day, are entered and the year of the birth of the subject.  The MRI scanner automatically imprints the date of the scan on each MRI image. After the scan is complete, the images are transferred from the CSI MRI secured server to VA owned server, using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption and password protected servers in secure data centers in use by Emory University. The data centers offer restricted access and are monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, per agreement between Emory University and the Atlanta VA Medical Center.  All data are stored on these servers, and data are accessed for analysis by workstations at the Atlanta VA Medical center, in the CVNR Neuroimaging Core in room 6205 in the Woodruff Memorial Research Building or PI's laboratory at Emory University in the Rehab Medicine Building, Room 150, 1441 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA  30029. Upon transfer of images to the VA servers, all scans are given the same date so that they cannot be identified by date of scan.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The National Administrative and Office Supplies Acquisition Center, New York, NY, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 06/05/2013 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to six (6) months before your offer is evaluated. 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: 
-Review the solicitation document for clause changes. 
-Note that all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) website. The SAM website can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov.
-Supplemental Proposal Instructions and Proposal Price List Preparation have been revised. All proposed labor categories subject to the SCA must be submitted using pricing method 1. See solicitation attachments.

As part of GSA's continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings

Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing

To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by another refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding Fee provisions. 

This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.

Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.  Submit eOffers at: http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<SUBJECT>Senior Devolution Advisor
<SOLNBR>SOL-615-15-000006
<RESPDATE>020515
<CONTACT>Justine Kibabu, Regional A&A Specialist, Email jkibabu@usaid.gov
<DESC>The Senior Devolution Advisor (SDA) will provide expert advice on all programmatic issues related to devolution including local government planning and management, governance, capacity building, conflict mitigation, public-private-partnerships, human resource and financial management, and civil society. The SDA reports to the USAID/Kenya DRG Office Director and coordinates closely with the Deputy Office Director. The incumbent coordinates USAID strategy, assistance, and policy in support of devolution and associated DRG and USAID/Kenya initiatives.
<p>The SDA provides leadership and management - both technical and financial - of a complex, $125-million five-year devolution portfolio with national impact. The incumbent ensures that USAID assistance for devolution is conceptualized soundly, analyzed rationally, coordinated well, monitored regularly, and managed effectively across five USAID technical offices, in collaboration with Department of State colleagues, and aligned with the work of international donor partners. Much of the work will be in Nairobi with frequent travel to counties to provide technical assistance, assess needs, and ensure effective monitoring and oversight of activities. Field work will include periodic assignments to support specific County Governments with discrete tasks that could last one to two weeks out of the month.</p>
<p>Duties will include managing USAID activities that contribute to successful devolution. As part of the USAID/Kenya DRG Team, the incumbent will, as required, initiate broader team administrative and programmatic functions. The SDA may serve as the Activity Manager or Assistance/Contracting Officer's Representative for a variety of contracts and agreements to support the portfolio. The SDA is responsible for representing USAID in donor meetings, technical working groups and in meetings with the host government, civil society, the media, and the private sector.</p>
<p>The SDA must have proven interpersonal skills and the ability to work in a highly political, cross-cultural environment. As a highly qualified professional, the SDA is expected to independently plan and carry out the activities required to fulfill their duties with minimal oversight.</p>
<p>As part of the USAID/Kenya DRG and DO1 teams, the incumbent will be responsible for providing input to the annual Operational Plan and annual Performance Report, as well as quarterly portfolio reviews-both programmatic and financial aspects. The incumbent will also provide talking points, briefing notes, and analysis in response to requests from the Ambassador, USAID Mission Director, DRG Office Director, USAID/Washington, Congress, and the Department of State and will be called upon to deliver these remarks periodically in formal verbal briefings. Strong English language presentation and writing skills are, therefore, required.</p>

<p><br />INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS AND PAYMENT:</p>
<p>USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (MAR 2010)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2007)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically. <br />The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. For Vendor Registration Assistance and account activation, please contact the DISA Ogden E-Business Help Desk at 1-866-618-5988 option 2. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site. Training for this application is available at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>Notice to Vendors: Delivery of services to any address other than the delivery address specified in the contract is not authorized without a contract modification signed by the Contracting Officer. Failure to deliver to the address in the contract will result in rejection of invoices and will cause delay in payment.</p>
<p>Contract Administrator for this Contract is: TO BE ASSIGNED AFTER AWARD</p>
<p>The contractor is directed to use the "2-in-1 format when processing invoices and receiving reports. When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions:</p>
<p>Contract Number TO BE ASSIGNED <br />Delivery Order <br />Cage Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Pay DoDAAC M67443<br />Issue Date TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Issue By DoDAAC H92257<br />Admin By DoDAAC H92257<br />Ship To Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Ship From Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />LPO DoDAAC "Leave Blank" <br />Acceptor Email Address TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext "Leave Blank"</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the "Issue By DoDAAC", "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Pay DoDAAC". Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for "Combo," "2-in-1," and "Cost Voucher" are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under "Vendor Interface" section. On the Vendor Interface page click on "WAWF-RA" header at the top of the page. Under downloads on the WAWF-RA page that appears, click the appropriate document either "Combo," "2-in-1," or "Cost Voucher" to download the instructions. <br />Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA, but after submitting the document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications. Contractor shall click on "Send More Email Notification" on the page that appears. Add the acceptor's/receiver's email address (Note this address is their work email address not their WAWF-RA organizational email address) in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system. <br /><br />NOTE: The POCs identified above are for WAWF-RA issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Administrator identified in the contract to whom questions are to be addressed.<br /><br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>SOFARS 5652.204-9003 Disclosure of Unclassified Information Nov 2007</p>
<p>(a) On September 21, 2001, the Department of Defense designated Headquarters US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) a sensitive unit, as defined by Title 10 United States Code (USC) Section 130b (10 USC 130b). In keeping with this designation, unclassified information related to USSOCOM military technology acquisitions managed by USSOCOM or any of its component commands, will be designated Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). As such, the contractor hereby unequivocally agrees that it shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any unclassified information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, contractor's external website, newspaper, magazine, journal, corporate annual report, etc.), pertaining to any part of this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval.

Forward any request to use the USSOCOM emblem or logo through the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS AND PAYMENT:</p>
<p>USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (MAR 2010)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2007)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically. <br />The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. For Vendor Registration Assistance and account activation, please contact the DISA Ogden E-Business Help Desk at 1-866-618-5988 option 2. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site. Training for this application is available at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>Notice to Vendors: Delivery of services to any address other than the delivery address specified in the contract is not authorized without a contract modification signed by the Contracting Officer. Failure to deliver to the address in the contract will result in rejection of invoices and will cause delay in payment.</p>
<p>Contract Administrator for this Contract is: TO BE ASSIGNED AFTER AWARD</p>
<p>The contractor is directed to use the "2-in-1 format when processing invoices and receiving reports. When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions:</p>
<p>Contract Number TO BE ASSIGNED <br />Delivery Order <br />Cage Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Pay DoDAAC M67443<br />Issue Date TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Issue By DoDAAC H92257<br />Admin By DoDAAC H92257<br />Ship To Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Ship From Code/Ext TO BE ASSIGNED<br />LPO DoDAAC "Leave Blank" <br />Acceptor Email Address TO BE ASSIGNED<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext "Leave Blank"</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the "Issue By DoDAAC", "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Pay DoDAAC". Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for "Combo," "2-in-1," and "Cost Voucher" are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under "Vendor Interface" section. On the Vendor Interface page click on "WAWF-RA" header at the top of the page. Under downloads on the WAWF-RA page that appears, click the appropriate document either "Combo," "2-in-1," or "Cost Voucher" to download the instructions. <br />Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA, but after submitting the document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications. Contractor shall click on "Send More Email Notification" on the page that appears. Add the acceptor's/receiver's email address (Note this address is their work email address not their WAWF-RA organizational email address) in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system. <br /><br />NOTE: The POCs identified above are for WAWF-RA issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Administrator identified in the contract to whom questions are to be addressed.<br /><br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>(d)</p>
<p>(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

<p>(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.</p>
<p>(iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor."</p>
<p>(3) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.</p>
<p>(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.</p>
<p>(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C. chapter 71.</p>
<p>(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the offer.</p>
<p>(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from</p>
<p>(1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<p>5652.204-9003 Disclosure of Unclassified Information and Notification Requirements for Cyber Security Breaches (JUN 2013) <br />On September 21, 2001, the Department of Defense designated Headquarters US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) a sensitive unit, as defined by Title 10 United States Code (USC) Section 130b (10 USC 130b). In keeping with this designation, unclassified information related to USSOCOM military technology acquisitions managed by USSOCOM or any of its component commands, will be designated Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). As such, the contractor hereby unequivocally agrees that it shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any unclassified information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, contractor's external website, newspaper, magazine, journal, corporate annual report, etc.), pertaining to any part of this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval. Furthermore, any release of information which associates USSOCOM, Special Operation Forces (SOF), or any component command with an acquisition program, contractor, or this contract is prohibited unless specifically authorized by USSOCOM.<br /><br />(a) Request for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, and the purpose for the release. The contractor shall submit the request to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days before the propose date for release for approval. No release of any restricted information shall be made without specific written authorization by the Contracting Office.<br /><br />(b) The protection of sensitive but unclassified data reflecting Special Operations technologies, personnel, plans, and business associations requires due diligence on the part of those in possession of such information. The application of appropriate security measures to ensure the safekeeping of USSOCOM and company proprietary data, intellectual property, and personnel data is the responsibility of all parties who have access to such information. All contractors supporting USSOCOM are required to inform the Contracting Officer within three business days of when there has been a breach or successful penetration of the contractor's network(s) or information system(s). Breaches include unauthorized intrusions of the contractor's server(s) from external parties whether through introduction of malware, hacking, the compromise of access passwords, or any other unauthorized access or compromise. Breaches also include the physical loss of storage media such and disks, hard drives, thumb drives, laptops or other devices which contain duplicates of information contained on the contractor's data systems, or the willful or accidental transmission, copying or posting of contract information which has not been specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. Estimates of damage and mitigation strategies will be submitted to the Contracting Officer within a period following the breach specified and agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall include a similar requirement to this clause in each subcontract under this contract. Subcontractors shall submit request for authorization to release and notifications related to cyber security breaches through the prime contractor to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />(d) The Contractor further understands that Title 18 USC Section 701 specifically prohibits the use of the USSOCOM emblem or logo in any medium (e.g., corporate website, marketing brochure, newspaper, magazine, etc.) unless authorized in writing by USSOCOM. Forward any request to use the USSOCOM emblem or logo through the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p><br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><strong><br />Proposal Submission Place:</strong><br />Luis Julian Zuluaga Lopez<br />Operations Manager<br />Organismo Coordinador del Sistema El&eacute;ctrico Nacional Interconectado<br />Calle 3 # 3 Arroyo Hondo Primero<br />Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<br />Telephone: 809-732-9330
<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance on smart grid and other potential technology upgrades in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The objective of the technical assistance is to determine the appropriate level of new smart grid and other technology upgrades needed in the Dominican Republic as well as to assess how best to integrate them into the national grid.  The technical assistance will evaluate a series of technologies to improve reliability, lower frequency regulation service costs, allow for real-time monitoring and control and enable greater adoption of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Grantee is the Coordinating Organization of the National Interconnected Electrical System of the Dominican Republic (Organismo Coordinador del Sistema El&eacute;ctrico Nacional Interconectado, OC-SENI).  At present there are 18 members of the nonprofit organization that is OC-SENI, comprised of generation and distribution companies and the national transmission company.  OC-SENI has initiated system upgrades to implement supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) to approximately 40 percent of its system and requires further technical assistance to proceed with additional upgrades.  The technical assistance will also assess the similar needs of all of the Dominican Republic's major generation, transmission and distribution agents.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $573,215 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 PM (local time in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic), February 16, 2015 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

How soon after the anticipated award will the vendor be expected to deliver production units? <br>  <br> A13. The actual ordering and delivery of the Tactical Power Supplies production units would commence after the delivery of the First Article Samples and Testing.  The Contracting Officer shall provide sufficient time in the delivery schedule for acquisition of materials and components and for production after receipt of first article approval.  When Government requirements preclude this action, the Contracting Officer may, before approval of the first article, authorize the contractor to acquire specific materials or components or commence production to the extent essential to meet the delivery schedule (see Alternate II of the clause at 52.209-3, First Article Approval -- Contractor Testing).  For this particular acquisition, it is FAR clause 52.209-3, First Article Approval -- Contractor Testing, with both Alternate I and Alternate II included. <br>  <br> Q14. What are the quantities and schedule delivery requirements? <br>  <br> A14. The proposed delivery schedule for the proposed Delivery Orders (DO)s is structured in accordance with standard industry practices for production, (e.g., it considers production capacity, an initial low production rate, and long lead items). The first DO will allow 180 days after the award of the DO for the first monthly delivery of tactical power supplies.  The mix of PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U shall be determined by the Government at the time the DOs are issued.  The total combined delivery quantity of DOs of one or both tactical power supplies is not required to exceed 500 total tactical power supplies per month. <br>  <br> Q15. When do you anticipate the release of a formal RFQ? <br>  <br> A15. The Government will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not have a firm date for when the RFP will be released. We are currently anticipating that the RFP will be issued February 2014. This anticipated date is subject to change. <br>  <br> Q16. We would like to know if the above referenced SOW [DRAFT SOW/DRAWINGS/PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION, W15P7T-14-R-E001] is eligible for set aside in part or whole? <br>  <br> A16. This requirement will be conducted on the basis of a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. <br>  <br> Q17.  Your attached survey references a technical data package. Is this different than the draft information you recently sent? Is this a build to print or new design? <br>  <br> A17.  The  quote mark Survey for Industry quote mark  had been closed since June 2012 and has been sent out for informational purposes only so that all offerors have the same information. The technical data package that was referenced in the survey is the same as the information that is currently being provided upon request to potential offerors. Please note that the documents being currently sent out are in draft format and are subject to change. This requirement is not build to print; rather it is performance based, which means the vendor will develop a design which shall meet all of the performance criteria. <br>  <br> Q18.     It appears the CECOM acquisition (initially W15P7T-12-R-A307) was transitioned to DLA (SPRBL1-14-R-0009) then transitioned back to CECOM (W15P7T-14-R-E001). Is this correct, or are there dual efforts, one being a 3 year IDIQ bridge to a former performance specification and the other being the follow-on to the bridge with the new performance specification? <br>  <br> A18. Solicitation number SPRBL1-14-R-0009 and solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001, (initially W15P7T-12-R-A307), are two separate efforts/notices. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is purchasing the previous version of the specification to provide interim Warfighter support (SPRBL1-14-R-0009), while Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is purchasing the updated version with the new performance specification (W15P7T-14-R-E001). <br>  <br> If you have any questions regarding the DLA solicitation number, SPRBL1-14-R-0009, please contact:  Eric.M.Snow.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> If you have any questions regarding the ACC-APG solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001, please contact: Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Q19.  W15P7T-14-R-E001 Notice to Industry posted January 9, 2014 solicits comments to the Draft SOW, DRAWINGS/PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION; however, retrieving the SOW, it is footnoted with the DLA acquisition SPRBL1-14-R-0009. Should it be W15P7T-14-R-E001? <br>  <br> A19. Please refer to above question; SPRBL1-14-R-0009 and W15P7T-14-R-E001 are separate solicitation notices. In accordance with the Notice to Industry posted January 10, 2014 for W15P7T-14-R-E001, all requests for copy of the Draft Statement of Work (SOW), the five Drawings, the Performance Specification, and the Draft Exceptions to Specifications shall be e-mailed to Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil. E-mails shall be titled with the subject line as follows: DRAFT SOW/DRAWINGS/PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION, W15P7T-14-R-E001.  <br>  <br> Q20.    W15P7T-14-R-E001 Notice to Industry posted January 9, 2014 advised emails be forwarded to Ms. Baldwin and Mr. Bosmans, however, Ms. Fletcher is noted as the Point of Contact. Please clarify who is the lead acquisition officer (PCO) for this effort. <br>  <br> A20.  The procurement contracting officer (PCO) is Barbara Hansen. The primary contract specialist and point of contact (POC) for this action is Roberta (Bobbi) Baldwin; the secondary POC is Brian Bosmans. All inquiries shall be directed to Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil and/or Brian.C.Bosmans.civ@mail.mil. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.     <br>  <br> Q21.  W15P7T-14-R-E001 Notice to Industry posted January 9, 2014 and modification January 10, 2014 do not stipulate the contract duration (originally a 5 year IDIQ to new Performance Specification MIL-PRF-49080 Rev D, then a 3 year bridge IDIQ with BEQ of 1,350 per year to a former performance specification MIL-PRF-49080 Rev B with pending Govt changes, now ???) and quantity <br>  <br> A21. The amended synopsis for W15P7T-14-R-E001 posted on December 31, 2013 on FedBizOpps states that the Government intends to award a five-year ordering period, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. MIL-PRF-49080 Rev D, the Draft Exceptions to Specification, along with the five drawings, are the technical data package for W15P7T-14-R-E001. As stated above, W15P7T-14-R-E001 and SPRBL1-14-R-0009 are separate solicitation notices. Any questions concerning SPRBL1-14-R-0009 and MIL-PRF-49080 Revision B must be directed to the point of contact for that action, Eric.M.Snow.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Q22. To show our range of experience and examples of our custom and COTS offerings and the programs and projects we support regularly I have attached our [Company Name] Presentation.   <br>  <br> A22. The Government will not review any company presentations, brochures, diagrams or literature including specifications/model/serial/part numbers of any available products as sent as part of this presolicitation Questions and Answers. All comments and concerns should be addressed in a question format. <br>  <br> Q23. [Company Name] would like to discuss this application with your engineering team.  We have [additional technical] questions. <br>   <br> A23. Discussions with the Government engineering team are not allowed, especially since they would violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation and potentially give an unfair competitive advantage.  Only written questions may be submitted to the persons designated for receipt of questions. <br>  <br> Q24. Also, [Company Name] would like to request a copy of the current Repair Manual to provide an example of your reparability requirements. <br>  <br> A24. The Government will not release the current Repair Manual from the former contract due to solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001 is a new requirement. <br>  <br> Q25. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Will there be a separate CLIN on the contract for pre-production development, and non-recurring equipment (NRE) to support manufacturing? <br>  <br> A25.  No, there will not be a specific Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for either of those items. The actual CLIN structure will be released with the formal Request for Proposal (RFP). <br>  <br> Q26. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Has the government determined the method for including FAT CLIN on the contract? <br>  <br> A26. All Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) for First Article Testing will be separate CLINS from the production CLINS. <br>  <br> Q27. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Does the government anticipate a separate CLIN be on the contract for FAT? <br>  <br> A27.  The First Article Test production units (14 Units) will have a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). The associated test results and reports will be a separate CLIN. <br>  <br> Q28. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> If so, what structure does the government anticipate using for the FAT CLIN? (CPFF, FFP, etc.) <br>  <br> A28. The Offerors' price proposal shall reflect a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) for each Contract Line Item/Subline Item Number (CLIN). <br>   <br> Q29. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Will the FAT CLIN be for testing only, or will the pricing include both the unit price as well as the first article testing costs? <br>  <br> A29.  The First Article Test production units (14 Units) will have a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). The associated test results and reports will be a separate CLIN. <br>  <br> Q30. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br>  [Company name] is able to provide quantity price breaks as we reach economies of scale in our manufacturing process.  Will the government be including provisions allowing offerors to propose stepladder pricing to take advantage of these discounts? <br>  <br> A30. The Range Pricing spreadsheet will be attached to Request for Proposal (RFP) to allow for range quantity pricing and discounts. <br>  <br> Q31. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR) <br>    <br> Sht 13  Para  3.14.1   Identification Label Ref Fig 1: Representative PP-6224()/U  Label <br> Is a size requirement applicable? <br>  <br> A31. There are no specific dimensional requirements for the label size, but as stated in MIL-PRF-49080D the label must be compliant with MIL-STD-13231 (e.g. Paragraph 5.7 Size and form of characters) <br>  <br> Q32. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.2.1.  It appears that the immersion requirements only apply with the product cover affixed to the product. Please confirm. <br>  <br> A32. That is correct, but it should be noted that the rain test is an operational test, i.e. with the cover open. <br>  <br> Q33. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.3.3 Remote-sensing cable connector <br> In the following sentence, [The connector shall be suitable for use in fabrication at the field level of remote since cable]. What does [use in fabrication] mean? <br>  <br> A33. It means the user will connect the appropriate wiring to the connector to fabricate a cable in the field. Remote sensing is used over long cable distances where voltage regulation is critical, usually in unique applications. As such, it was decided to provide the user with the connector and instructions to fabricate a cable rather than just providing a generic cable. <br>  <br> Q34. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.5.4 Output meter <br> The output meter shall be capable of displaying DC output voltage or current. What is the required resolution for these meters? <br>  <br> A34. The resolution should be to one significant figure after the decimal. <br>  <br> Q35. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.6 DC adjustment <br> What is the required resolution for DC adjustment? <br>  <br> A35. The adjustment should be analog or to one significant figure after the decimal. <br>  <br> Q36. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.7.6.2 Overload protection <br> Where shall the resettable circuit breakers in the AC input circuit and the DC output circuit reside? <br>  <br> A36. An exact location is not required, but previous generations have all had the circuit breakers on the front of the power supply. <br>  <br> Q37. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.7.8 Remote Sense and Para 4.5.6 Remote Sense <br> The Remote sense requirement appears to be in conflict with the remote sense test. The remote sense requirement (3.7.8) is asking for 1V of remote sense. This requirement should be rewritten for clarity at some point. <br>  <br> The test of 4.5.6 will require 2V of remote sense to pass.  <br> The diagram below is how we interpret the test setup. <br>  <br> A37. The Government will not review diagrams sent as part of this presolicitation Q&A. All comments and concerns should be addressed in a question format. <br> There is no stated limit of 1V remote sense. What may be the cause for confusion is the relaxing of the requirement to 29V output at the load which is 25ft away from the power supply. This is because the power supply is only required to provide 32V, and requiring 32V at the load in this case would require a higher output voltage. <br>  <br> Q38. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Paragraphs 4.9.1 - 4.9.3 <br> With Safety requirement UL 60950-1, will the testing be required if the components used inside the unit are safety agency approved, but the top assembly of the item is not approved? <br>  <br> A38. Yes <br>  <br> Q39. Ref SM-D-667917 <br> Cable Assembly.  The cables that are required with the items. <br> How are they provided and shipped with the product? <br>  <br> A39. They should be provided in the same box with the power supply. Intermediate packaging may be used as appropriate. <br>  <br> Q40. Ref A328-6985 <br> Housing Assy Mounting Reqts. <br> Are there any requirements on the type of material that is used for the housing described? <br>  <br> A40. No. This is a performance based requirement. Materials chosen shall meet all requirements of the specification. For example the shock test will stress the mounts. <br>   <br> Q41: Attachment 1, Requirements for Contractor Performed First Article Testing [Sec. 3.6]: <br>  Will all FAT be conducted solely at the contractor's facility, or will government or other independent laboratory testing be required? <br>  <br> A41. First Article Testing (FAT) will be conducted at the contractor's facility or at a facility of their choice. All testing will subject to Government oversight. <br>  <br> Q42. Attachment 1, Requirements for Contractor Performed First Article Testing [Sec. 3.6]: <br> When will the First Article Test Plan [Sec. 3.6.4] be due to the government? <br>  <br> A42. See the data items A002-1 and A002-2.The data items will be provided with the official Request for Proposal (RFP) release. <br>  <br> Q43. Attachment 1, Requirements for Contractor Performed First Article Testing [Sec. 3.6]: <br> In Section 3.6.10, the SOW provides disposition instructions for 9 of the 10 FAT units.  Please confirm that, per Attachment MIL-PRF-49080D, Table I, this unit is to be destroyed upon completion of Fungus testing.  If not to be destroyed, please provide instructions for the 10th FAT unit. <br>  <br> A43. It is to be disposed of in any appropriate manner after First Article approval, or earlier with the consent of the Contracting Officer. <br>  <br> Q44. Attachment 1, Production Test Procedures [Sec. 3.6.11]: <br> Please confirm that the government intends to have Production Test Procedures be identical to First Article Testing.  Typically, FAT testing is more thorough and detailed than Production testing.  By only testing select key performance areas and eliminating or reducing the frequency of stringent testing, (environmental, thermal, EMI, and elevation, for example) costs will be reduced dramatically, and production capacity will increase. <br>  <br> A44. See paragraph 4.4 of MIL-PRF-49080D for conformance inspection requirements which are a subset of First Article tests. Note that some tests are on a sample basis or at a given time interval. When any test is required to be performed, the procedures shall be identical to First Article Testing (FAT). <br>  <br> Q45. Attachment 1, Production Test Procedures [Sec. 3.6.11]: <br> Consider allowing a Production Test Plan be presented for approval that allows an abbreviated version of the FAT tests. <br>  <br> A45. The Government intends to require all tests as described in the specification. Alternate testing requirements will not be considered at this time. <br>  <br> Q46. Attachment 1, Production Test Procedures [Sec. 3.6.11]: <br> If the government intends for the FAT and production test to be identical, please explain the relationship between Attachment MIL-PRF-49080D, Table I and the production units.  I.e. will all units be tested for all 21 items in the table, or since Electromagnetic Interference testing is only performed on 10% (1 of the 10) FAT units, will we be required to perform Electromagnetic Interference testing on only 10% of the production units as well? <br>  <br> A46. See answer number A42 above. <br>  <br> Q47. Attachment 2, Requirements for Low Pressure (Altitude) Testing [Sec. 4.6.11] <br> What leakage rate is acceptable? <br>  <br> A47. See MIL-PRF-49080D paragraph 3.10. <br>  <br> Q48. Attachment 2, Requirements for Low Pressure (Altitude) Testing [Sec. 4.6.11] <br> The defined connectors are pressure rated but not hermetically sealed. <br>   <br> A48. The specification is performance based and equivalent connectors are permitted. <br>  <br> Q49. Attachment 2, Remote Sensing [Sec. 4.5.6] <br> When using this in remote sense is there a situation where it switches over to the battery source or is this strictly an AC powered test? <br>  <br> A49. Battery changeover is not tested during this test. <br>  <br> Q50. Attachment 2, Remote Sensing [Sec. 4.5.6] <br> Our concern is that the power supply can be adjusted down to 24VDC and feed the battery input with a higher voltage while using the remote sensing cables. <br>  <br> A50. If the user requires a specific voltage other than the battery voltage, a battery should not be used in the application. <br>  <br> Q51. Attachment 2, Surge Immunity [SEC. 3.7.6.5] <br> How many joules of energy in the 2Kv surge? <br>  <br> A51. Refer to IEC 61000-4-5 for information on the test method. <br>  <br> Q52. Attachment 2, Immersion [Sec 4.6.4] Low Pressure (Altitude) [Sec. 3.8.3] Air-Seal [3.10] <br> Will the front cover from (Sec 3.3.2.1) be in place during these tests? <br>  <br> A52. Yes, the front cover may be in place. <br>  <br> Q53. Attachment 2, Weight [Sec. 3.4] <br> Will the power supply in its packaging for a total of 44lbs include the cables? <br>  <br> A53. Yes. <br>  <br> Q54. Attachment 2, Grounding Continuity [Sec. 4.9.4] <br> Is external grounding stud required? <br>  <br> A54. No. <br>  <br> Q55. [Company Name] also requests the full mechanical requirements for this power supply.  The mechanical drawings provided do not provide a complete definition of the requirements.  The A3286985 drawing does not show specific locations desired for indicators and connector interfaces. And [Company Name] would like to understand better the various installations for these power supplies related to thermal mount and thermal dissipation expected in the various environments.  Where does it get mounted? Is it always mounted the same way? <br>  <br> A55. Exact locations for indicators and connectors are not specified and it is expected that exact placement will vary among different designs. The power supply is universal in nature and has no one particular application.  <br>  <br> Q56. In drawing SM-B-667921.pdf  it mentions as copied below that this is a pressurized rated connector.  Is the power supply itself pressurized? <br>  <br> A56. The power supply is not pressurized but it does have immersion and altitude requirements. <br>   <br>  <br> Q57. In drawing SM-D-667917_80063_0001_A.pdf  is the Length defined for the final proposal phase in the bid request?  Below is the remarks from that drawing: <br>  <br> A57. Cable lengths are specified in MIL-PRF-49080D. <br>  <br> Q58. In drawing SM-D-667953.pdf  is the Length defined for the final proposal phase in the bid request?  Below is the remarks from that drawing: <br>  <br> A58. Cable lengths are specified in MIL-PRF-49080D. <br>  <br> Q59. Is power factor correction acceptable for this project?  <br>  <br> A59. As this is a minimum performance based requirement, any enhancement that is not directly in contradiction with any stated requirements would be acceptable. <br>  <br> Q60.  Paragraph 3.9.  of the spec requires that the product shall comply with the applicable emissions and susceptibility requirements from  line 3 (Aircraft, Army, Including Flight Line) MIL 461 Table V. However, the requirement mentions that RS103 shall be performed from 10kHz to 400MHz while MIL STD 461F specifies different frequency ranges.  (see below) RS101, radiated susceptibility, magnetic fields, 30 Hz to 100 kHz RS103, radiated susceptibility, electric field, 2 MHz to 40 GHz. <br> Shall we meet the spec requirements instead of RS101 and RS103? <br>  <br> A60. Yes, MIL-PRF-49080 takes precedence over MIL-STD-461 for this acquisition. <br>  <br> Q61. Do the current limits from paragraph 3.7.6.3 apply in battery backup mode as well? <br>  <br> A61. Yes. <br>  <br> Q62. Does paragraph 3.7.3 apply only for normal mode (AC voltage input)? (It is not 100% clear just from reading the spec) <br>  <br> A62. See MIL-PRF-49080D paragraph 4.5.1.2 for specific test voltage inputs. <br>  <br>

<DESC>W15P7T-14-R-E001 <br> Presolicitation Questions (Q) and Answers (A) <br> Received 30 January 2014 - 05 February 2014 <br>  <br> No additional questions will be answered until after the release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP), with the exception of Q74 (see below). <br>   <br> Q63. Referencing synopsis W15P7T-14-R-E001, our records show no updates as of late. Can you tell me if it has been issued as a formal RFP, canceled, or awarded already? <br>  <br> A63. The Government has not issued the related Request for Proposal (RFP). When the RFP is issued, it will be announced.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from this Q&A. <br>  <br> Q64. The Tactical Power Supplies PP-622D/U and PP-2953E/U has been going on for quite some time. When do you anticipate a release for the actual solicitation?  <br>  <br> A64. The Government does not have a firm date for when the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released. We are currently anticipating that the RFP will be issued March 2014.  This anticipated date is subject to change. <br>  <br> Q65. Can we bid on this solicitation? Or this one is for preapproved sources and specific vendors only? <br>  <br> A65.  All companies that can classify as a small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 335999 may respond to the solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001 for Tactical Power Supplies. <br>  <br> Q66. I would appreciate it if you could let us know how we can get the drawings for this solicitation? <br>  <br> A66. The Government will continue to send Draft SOW, Drawings, Performance Specification, and Draft Exceptions to Specifications to all requests until further notice. If any potential offerors have not requested and received the Draft SOW, Drawings, Performance Specification, and Draft Exceptions to Specifications; please request that information as soon as possible. Please send your request to the primary point of contact (POC) for this action Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> Q67. We are ISO 9001:2008 certified (Please see attachment). Is this quality level acceptable for this solicitation? <br>  <br> A67.  There is not a specific quality certification or compliance level in this requirement.  In addition, the Government will not review any company certifications, forms, presentations, brochures, diagrams or literature including specifications/model/serial/part numbers of any available products as sent as part of this presolicitation Questions and Answers.  <br>  <br> Q68. Enclosed please find our form DD 2345 [Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement]. <br>  <br> A68. See above concerning forms; in addition, all comments and concerns should be addressed in a question format. <br>  <br> Q69.  We request clarification concerning the use of lubricants in the assembly.  Drawing SM D 667953 note 4 states no lubricants. Is that correct? <br>  <br> A69.  The use of lubricants is at the discretion of the vendor. Per MIL-PRF-49080D, paragraph 3.3.3.2, in reference to the above cable it states  quote mark This drawing is referenced for dimensional and interface purposes only. quote mark  As such, if all 'dimensional and interface' requirements are met, the actual assembly of the cable is up to the vendor.  <br>  <br> Q70.    Regarding drawing SM D 667917, note 5 describes an additional current path to ground by way of the connector body.  Is there a recommendation for achieving this or is it left to us to solve? <br>   <br> A70. Implementation is up to the vendor. <br>   <br> Q71. Is the output voltage to be selected by a front panel switch? <br>  <br> A71. As this is a variable voltage power supply, a switch would not be sufficient to set the voltage. The control (e.g. dial or similar) for the output voltage should indeed be on the front panel. <br>    <br> Q72. Older versions of the power supply had three ON/OFF switches on the front panel, but the new performance specification (REV D) mentions only two ON/OFF switches? <br>   <br> A72.  Only 2 circuit breakers are required as per the current specification. <br>  <br> Q73. What is the required number of front panel voltage selection switches? <br>  <br> A73.  See A71. <br>  <br> Q74. Are the drawings and specifications export controlled documents?  Are there ITAR consideration precluding us from building these assemblies in China? <br>  <br> A74.

<DESC>SUMMARY   <br>    <br>  This is a notice of a proposed contract action issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.203(a). The Government intends to issue a solicitation and award up to 1 contract for the supplies described   <br>  below. This acquisition will be available to industry on an unrestricted basis. This notice is not a solicitation; information on release of the solicitation is provided below.   <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND   <br>    <br>  The CIDAS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III joint program with participation from all Services (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps). The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). The Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) manages the effort and the CIDAS Product Management Office (PMO) executes the program.   <br>    <br>  The goal of CIDAS is to provide the Warfighter a capability that not only indicates trace levels of chemical warfare agents on surfaces before and/or after a decontamination operation, but also visually indicates the exact location of that contamination and provides significant utility during Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) operations. This technology will afford Warfighters the ability to accurately map the area of disseminated contamination on equipment and quickly determine if a given area is (or is not) contaminated. This technology has unique benefits, such as isolating quote mark hot spots quote mark from quote mark clean spots quote mark on surfaces and visibly indicating whether standard decontamination procedures performed were successful (i.e., decontamination assurance). Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, DED personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements, and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency. The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to potential damage from the application of the indicator.   <br>    <br>  The CIDAS will provide a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology, henceforth called quote mark indicator quote mark , and scalable applicator(s) for use on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, aircraft, crew-served weapons, and individual/personnel weapons that may have been exposed to chemical contamination in hostile and non-hostile environments. The CIDAS indicator, as applied by an applicator, will provide the capability to indicate and locate the presence of traditional and/or non-traditional chemical warfare agent (CWA) contamination. For purposes of this document, the term quote mark CIDAS quote mark refers to both the indicator and applicator. The CIDAS will include small scale, mid scale, and large scale system configurations, for use by the Services to meet the requirements of varying missions.   <br>    <br>  This effort encompasses identification and evaluation of a mature technology that fulfills the CIDAS requirements for small and mid scale systems, and an indicator(s) for the large scale system. This effort includes one or more indicators, which can be applied by all three sizes of applicators (e.g., small, mid and large scale). While the Contractor will provide the small and mid scale applicators, the Government will provide the large scale applicator, which will apply the same indicator(s) that is being provided by the Contractor for the small and mid scale systems. Contractor proposed solutions (for the mid and small scale systems and indicator for the large scale system) will be expected to have at least a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level of 6 and will be evaluated across the full set of CIDAS requirements during Technology Readiness Assessments (TRAs) and Manufacturing Readiness Assessments (MRAs) throughout the program life cycle.   <br>    <br>  The CIDAS will undergo a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in conjunction with the Start of Work meeting. Prior to fabricating CIDAS test articles for Developmental Testing (DT) and an Operational Assessment (OA), the CIDAS will undergo a Critical Design Review (CDR) to establish the initial product baseline. The detailed specifications and technical data for CIDAS materials will remain under Contractor control but Class 1 changes to materials will require Government approval starting with CDR and continuing throughout the life cycle of CIDAS. Toward the end of DT, the Contractor shall support and attend a combined System Verification Review (SVR)/Production Readiness Review (PRR) to verify the production baseline.   <br>    <br>  If the option for LRIP/Operational testing (OT) is exercised, the Contractor shall fabricate the LRIP systems, based on the product description delivered to the Government during DT, and shall collaboratively conduct a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) on these systems. The LRIP/OT systems will also be used during the Logistics Demonstration, Production Qualification Testing, and Multi-Service Operational Testing and Evaluation (MOT&E).   <br>    <br>  Performance requirements for LRIP/Production, including details of first article and conformance inspections, will be included in the CIDAS PSPEC, which will be updated at the conclusion of DT. Performance requirements for FRP, including updated details of first article and conformance inspections, will be included in the CIDAS PSPEC which will be updated at the conclusion of the Production and Deployment phase.   <br>    <br>    <br>  RELEASE OF SOLICITATION   <br>  This acquisition will be available to industry on an unrestricted basis. The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) no earlier than 4 December 2014. Proposals will be due 30 calendar days following release of the RFP. The Government will only evaluate proposals offered from responsible sources. The Government intends to award no more than 1 Fixed Price Incentive Fee Successive Target, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a term of 120 months.  <br>    <br>  Point of Contact(s):   <br>  Lisa Mardin, (508) 233-6121, lisa.m.mardin.ctr@mail.mil   <br>     <br>

<DESC>**This announcement corrects the previous posting of Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) DTFAWA-15-R-00006 Amendment 000001.  The previous posting neglected to provide an amended Section A.  This announcement provides Amendment 00001 to Section A.  In addition, the previous posting of Amendment 000001 provided an Attachment J.4 that was incorrectly named Section J Att J.4 Amendment 00001.  The correct abbreviated name for this document is Section J Att J.4 Amendment 000001.  Because this correction only adds a fifth zero in the amendment number in the name for Attachment J.4 but does not change the document itself, a revised Attachment J.4 is not being provided at this time.**

**Amendment 000001 removes the previously posted Section J Attachment J.4 ARTCC CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL POWER SYSTEM SITE LIST MicroSoft (MS) Word document and replaces it with Section J Attachment J.4 Amendment 000001 in as an MS Excel document.  The amended J.4 attachment provides mailing addresses for all twenty-five (25) of the ACEPS facilities that were previously listed on the original Attachment J.4.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROJECTIONS (CCAP)
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide analytical and related services to provide an internal view of the General and Special Risk Insurance Fund (GI/SRI) and a small portion of the Mutual Mortgage Fund (MMI) (to be included in references to the GI/SRI fund) and assist the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to manage the risk of its portfolio of insured mortgage loans. The internal view and risk management is expected to be provided and accomplished by the contractor through a series of risk management and financial reports to be known as Commercial Capital Assessment Projections (CCAP).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Transactions associated with the FHA's guarantee programs for commercial (commercial includes multifamily apartment complexes, hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living residences, Board and Care facilities) mortgages are recorded in an account of the federal government known as the GI/SRI. FHA has insured over 45,000 million mortgages through the GI/SRI since 1970 of which over 13,000 are currently active. Aggregate insurance in force was $90 billion as of 9/30/14. Cash flows on these insurance policies result from both FHA's insurance operations and from transactions mandated by federal credit reform. Aggregate GI/SRI cash flows and performance measures are reported monthly.</p>
<p>The CCAP will have a monthly operating cycle. New input data from FHA and other appropriate sources will be updated each month or as needed for special projects principally at the direction of the Office of Management and Budget. (Information drawn from FHA is the transfer of data the contractor might need from FHA. This pertains specifically to the FHA data subject to the GI/SRI Funds for which CCAP is requesting portfolio, valuation and risk modeling. The data and frequency FHA will execute the transfers to the contractor will depend of what kind of data the contractor will need from FHA. It is anticipated these data will be transferred on a regular basis preferably monthly.) Differences between previously forecast and subsequent actual values will be evaluated for out-of -tolerance outcomes and adjustments to models will be made where appropriate. New reports and forecasts will be generated after the current accuracy and reliability of CCAP components has been established.</p>
<p>The model shall provide a sound and effective risk management to RMCAP in accordance with principles and standards such as those established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (AB-2013-07-Model-Risk-Management-Guidance) and The Federal Reserve Board and The Comptroller of the Currency (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management). This is to also to develop, document, operate and manage the RMCAP in accordance with all applicable OMB Circulars (A-11, A-123 and A-129 (OMB Circulars)), and all applicable Federal Accounting and Audit Standards (FASAB Handbook).</p>
<p>Requirements Description<br />Performance Objectives:</p>
<p>Task Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Analyze the content of appropriate FHA information systems to identify the data elements needed to best achieve each of CCAP's objectives and work with FHA personnel and contractors to develop, implement and operate processes to transfer that information to CCAP.</p>
<p>2. Provide risk measurement and monitoring information. Intended use: accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of monthly deviations between contractual, budgeted and actual GI/SRI loan performance and the risks causing those deviations (prepayments, delinquencies, claims, losses, recoveries, etc.) by risk category, cohort, portfolio and other appropriate aggregates by: (a) calculating monthly loan level contractual and actual loan performance measures for the FHA commercial portfolios; (b) allocating the differences by type of risk expressed as dollars, as a percent of contractual or budgeted cash flows, and as conditional and cumulative performance measures rates (performance measures include default, claim, and prepayment rates).</p>
<p>3. Provide information placing risk in historical perspective. Intended use: accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the position in historical context of each monthly aggregate deviation between contractual, budgeted and actual GI/SRI cash flows by type of risk by calculating the percentile position (or other appropriate measure) of each monthly deviation to its historical distribution.</p>
<p>4. Provide property disposition information. Intended use: accurately and reliably inform FHA decision-makers of historical and probable future note and property-level net proceeds by probability (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) and method of disposition.</p>
<p>5. Provide probable future cash flows from outstanding insurance-in-force. Intended use: for outstanding endorsements on a monthly basis: reliably and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of future monthly undiscounted cash flows by probability (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) for each cohort and other appropriate aggregate by line item on the cash activity report taking into analytic account probable future economic environments and the probable loan-level deviations from contractual cash flows expected to result from those environments.</p>
<p>6. Estimate the performance of the loan risk categories, cohorts and portfolios used to generate the guaranty liability. Intended use: as a component of FHA's financial statements as of each October 31st. FHA's loan guaranty liability is part of its annual financial statements which are targeted for completion at or soon after mid-November.</p>
<p>7. Provide probable future risk category, cohort, portfolio insurance-in-force cash flows (beginning with the cash flows provided by the Cash Flow Team) and performance measures. Intended use: on a monthly basis for the next seven risk categories, cohorts, portfolios: reliably and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of predicted insurance-in-force and monthly undiscounted cash flows and performance measures by probability (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) by taking into analytic account probable future economic environments and the probable loan-level deviations from contractual cash flows expected to result from those environments.</p>
<p>8. Provide capital ratio monitoring. Intended use: on a monthly basis, accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of (a) the level and trend of compliance with the GI/SRI's target capital ratio and (b) the probable future compliance with the GI/SRI's target capital ratio by: calculating capital ratios for the commercial risk categories, cohorts, portfolios, individually and collectively, and for the GI/SRI fund by dividing the valuations provided by the cash flow team the Cash Flow Team by the corresponding values of insurance-in-force.</p>
<p>9. Provide menu-driven policy analyses. Intended use: (a) on a monthly basis, accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the levels and trends of selected performance indicators (credit subsidy rate, delinquency rate, claim rate, loss rate, firm commitment volume, endorsement volume etc.) over the appropriate ranges of historical underwriting criteria, servicers, servicing and property disposition practices and cross-tabulations thereof by risk category, cohort, portfolio, program and other appropriate aggregates; and, (b) accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the impacts of changes in selected historical loan performance indicators (credit subsidy rate, delinquency rate, claim rate, loss rate, firm commitment volume, endorsement volume etc.) that would have resulted from changes in the historical ranges of selected underwriting criteria, servicers, servicing and property disposition practices and cross-tabulations thereof by risk category, cohort, portfolio and other appropriate aggregates.</p>
<p>10. Provide policy analyses requiring new or extended methods, models and/or estimation. Intended use: (a) as needed, provide expert analytic services to adapt the CCAP software to accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the probable impacts (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) of adopting new underwriting criteria, Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) changes, servicing, eligibility requirements, loan size criteria, new program specifications or other proposed program changes and property disposition practices on selected performance indicators (credit subsidy rate, delinquency rate, claim rate, refinance rate, loss rate, firm commitment volume, endorsement volume etc.) including cross-tabulations of new and existing criteria and practices by risk category, cohort, portfolio and other appropriate aggregates; (b) compare the projected performance to the pre-change historical performance; (c) where appropriate, add the analyses to the array of menu-driven policy analyses such that they can be rerun and downloaded after updating inputs but without additional contract labor effort.</p>
<p>11. Provide information for annual report. Intended use: (a) annually, using results generated by achieving Objective 7 as of October 31st, summarize the level and trend of GI/SRI valuations and the GI/SRI capital ratio together with probable future valuations and capital ratios for the next seven fiscal years in one or more formats appropriate to FHA's Report to Congress; and, (b) provide expert analytic services to summarize and explain the data and trends, the general risks to the forecast and the specific risks to the GI/SRI valuations and capital ratios. FHA generally completes its Report to Congress between mid-November and mid-December of each year.</p>
<p>12. Provide budget performance estimates and re-estimates. Intended use: enhance FHA's ability to effectively and efficiently achieve GI/SRI policy goals at minimal risk to taxpayers and to comply with GI/SRI capital ratio requirements by: (a) adapting information and models produced to achieve Objectives 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 to accurately and reliably estimate probable credit subsidy rates and probable firm commitment and endorsement volumes for budget risk category, cohort, portfolios and corresponding re-estimates for outstanding risk category, cohort, portfolios and inform FHA decision-makers of their probable impacts on GI/SRI capital resources and the need for mandatory appropriations; (b) estimate the probable performance measures rates which correspond to probable credit subsidy rates; (c) estimate the probable impacts of the prescribed economic assumptions on probable GI/SRI performance measures and other key variables and, as needed, provide analytic support for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of deviations from prescribed budget practices; and, (d) provide all budgetary materials in the formats prescribed by the OMB.</p>
<p>13. Provide report storage and retrieval. Intended use: each report and similar output and its supporting data will be organized by the contractor for electronic storage with efficient, user friendly query and retrieval capabilities.</p>
<p>14. Provide reports and inquiry capability currently available in the OPIIS (Online Property Integrated Information Suite) model and tool. Intended Use: To provide HUD/Housing available information reports on commercial property risk assessment for HUD Headquarters and the HUD Field Offices. Currently OPIIS does not contain reports for the 232 and 242 programs. The Base Year will include adding reports for the 232 and 242 programs reports and modifying reports. Currently the OPPIS model contains approximately 50 reports and online views consisting of commercial property FHA-insured loans consisting of insured loan portfolio data such as insurance-n-force, location, units, number of buildings, financial statements, vacancy rates, risk assessment of default, etc.<br /><br />15. CCAP must provide the similar services offered in OPIIS:<br />a. Provide access to approximately 2,000 HUD/Housing/FHA users nationwide including US Territories;</p>
<p>b. Help Desk with phone number and email for questions from field and HUD Headquarters;</p>
<p>c. In addition to the existing reports in OPIIS being replicated in the Base Year, up to 12 new reports will be developed in CCAP;</p>
<p>d. Business and model support on HUD at work website including updated DED updates, training, etc.;</p>
<p>e. Provide full day to day operation and maintenance;</p>
<p>f. New tool development or enhancement similar to develop of Property Review Template tool on an as-needed basis. The model changes are more service-provider driven than HUD driven and therefore the service provider must update changes on mutually agreed upon timeframes;</p>
<p>g. Model and Tool documentation;</p>
<p>h. Model and Tool user support hours will be provided each year and in what format,</p>
<p>i. Fully document, test, and implement any new data additions and changes to models, tools and database(s). Contractor will be responsible for new script development to support model, tool and database changes and additions;</p>
<p>j. Ad-hoc data requests - up to 12 per month - be handled for data requests from Sr. Management, program areas, Capitol Hill, etc.;</p>
<p><br />Technical objectives:</p>
<p>1. Simplicity: to help manage operational risk, each CCAP task objective must be achieved by the simplest methods available for the required accuracy and reliability. The processes by which the CCAP produces information to inform FHA decision-makers must be comprehensible by mortgage insurance practitioners.</p>
<p>2. Efficiency: to ensure maximum timeliness of the information produced by CCAP and to help ensure that project and budget development deadlines are met, the total elapsed time between the availability of required inputs to CCAP and the availability of decision-ready reports must be minimized without degrading the reliability, precision or other qualitative aspects of the information.</p>
<p>3. Model risk management: each CCAP task objective must be achieved within a provided framework effectively designed to manage model risk to within tolerable levels.</p>
<p>4. Transparency: each component of the CCAP must be adequately documented so as to: (1) prevent key person or contractor dependency; (2) enable proper operation; (3) facilitate independent review with minimal assistance; and, (4) reduce risk when report or model is changed.</p>
<p>5. Credibility: all information produced by each CCAP component must be authoritatively credible as evidenced by professional acceptance as best practices of the methods used to produce the information and the recognized expertise of the subject matter expert in the fields of financial analysis and modeling, financial risk management, mortgage analytics and mortgage insurance and as required by FHA, OMB or other governmental standards.</p>
<p>6. Inputs: all risk measurement and model assumptions and data must be appropriate, accurate and complete.</p>
<p>7. Processes: all processes must be conceptually valid, logically consistent and conform to then current best practices; all code must be verified to the corresponding theory and mathematics.</p>
<p>8. Outputs: all information generated by the CCAP must include a brief, thorough and comprehensible assessment of its accuracy and reliability. Such assessments will include monthly comparisons of predicted and actual outcomes to ensure that differences remain within tolerances.</p>
<p>9. Loan guaranty liability: all inputs, processes and estimates of loan guaranty liability must conform to all accounting and audit standards and other authoritative pronouncements applicable to FHA and conform to concepts and guidance provided by the OMB.</p>
<p>Program Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Ownership: FHA must own and be in a format acceptable to HUD, effective ownership and possession, such as through a custodian, of all versions of the CCAP processes, models, reports, data and related documentation at the end of each business day and the end of the contract term. Required to host the models, tools and data in a secure location acceptable to FHA.</p>
<p>2. Compliance: each CCAP component must at all times be fully compliant with all applicable laws, regulations, circulars, accounting and audit standards and related guidance and other authoritative pronouncements. must provide documentary evidence of authoritative knowledge and successful experience at designing, developing, testing, documenting, implementing, operating and maintaining financial risk measurement, econometric, statistical forecasting and management models to applicable federal standards.</p>
<p>3. Independent validation: all CCAP risk management and financial models must be independently validated to determine whether results accurately meet the requirements of their intended use and are reasonable for use as determined by FHA. Each validation will test whether model results can be replicated reliably by an independently developed parallel model constructed from model documentation only.</p>
<p>4. Computing and related capacity: CCAP must be supported by enough computer hardware, software, personnel related resources to facilitate achievement of its efficiency objective. This includes updating documentation and reporting requirements in a timely manner.</p>

The WAF Phase 2 hardware will be installed on the US Marine Corps (USMC) garrison classified and unclassified networks; all hardware and software will be shipped to our Norfolk, VA location.</p>
<p>The Qualifying NAICS code(s) for this effort are 334111 and 511210. MCSC is seeking information from industry regarding the technical challenges and estimated cost for the requested WAF Phase 2 Imperva hardware, software, training and professional services. The technical information submitted in response to this RFI can be in the form of white papers, specifications, lessons learned, or any other documentation that directly relates to web application hardware and software. All solutions and responses must be compatible with the existing Imperva design and central management system procured in May 2014, contract #M67854-14-C-4401.

<p>3. Does your company hold a Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) or other contract vehicle that allows outside agency ordering authority? If yes, please provide the contract number and POC information.</p>
<p>4. Based on past experience does your company have any lessons learned on hardware and software similar to this?</p>

<AWARDEE>Lockheed Martin Corporation, 1111 Lockheed Martin Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 US
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency is announcing the award of a sole-source letter contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation - Space Systems Company, Sunnyvale, California with a not-to-exceed (NTE) price of $91,057,794. This is a modification to the previously awarded contract HQ0147-12-G-9000 0001 for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) weapon system.&nbsp; This modification&nbsp;acquires Continental United States and Outside Continental United States support for services and equipment to ensure execution of Foreign Military Sale (FMS) Case AE-B-UAF to field the THAAD Weapon System. Work will be performed at Las Cruces, New Mexico; Huntsville, Alabama; Sunnyvale, California; and United Arab Emirates with an expected completion date of October 31, 2019. Non-expiring, direct site funds (as provided under this FMS case) will be used. The Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, Alabama is the contracting activity (HQ0147).
<p>This sole source contract action is authorized under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and (d)(1)(B), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii), which authorizes other than full and open competition when the required supplies/services are available from only one responsible source, or only from a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)
<p>25 November 2014</p>
<p>NOTICE OF AWARD OF A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of award for a sole source contract under the statutory authority Title 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. In accordance with FAR 5.302 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopses of Awards: Contracting officers shall transmit synopses of contract awards in the same manner as prescribed in 5.207.</p>
<p>The government found that the incumbent contractor, MCR Federal, is the only source that can provide the immediate services for the current critical mission. As the current contract ordering period has expired, the government requires a short one month base period with four one-month option periods carry-over contract to bridge the gap for a follow-on competitive contract.</p>
<p>This sole source contract will allow the incumbent, MCR Federal LLC to continue business management and financial support services needed for the Air Force's Space and Missile System's Center ORS program office (SMC/ORS). This effort includes: business management support, cost estimating, Comprehensive Cost and Requirements System (CCaRs) Administration, execution of funds: commitments, obligations, expenditures reconciliation, earned value management, acquisition reports, program objective memorandum (POM) inputs, defense travel systems, review and traveler assistance, CCAR and program management training, headquarter taskers, funding drills, what-if drills, and reimbursable efforts. This sole source contract includes firm fixed price (FPP) and cost reimbursable (CR) line items and four one-month period options, with total contract value of $88,205.43 or $422,000 if all options are exercised. The sole purpose of this contract is to ensure these critical mission requirements continue without disruption.</p>
<p>This notice of award is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>The incumbent is the only contractor that can provide the current services without disruption, therefore avoiding a break in service which could jeopardize the ORS mission. An urgent and compelling need exists for the continuation of these business management and financial services, as any interruption of services obtained under the current task order will introduce an unacceptable risk to SMC/ORS. This sole source task order will enable the ability to maintain the current level of expertise in business management and financial support without jeopardizing the mission. It is not practical to change contractors right now, as there is also a steep learning curve that a new contractor could not accomplish quickly enough without causing a severe impact to the mission.</p>
imited Source Justification Attached.
