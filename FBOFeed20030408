<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for research and/or exploratory development.  This solicitation can be viewed on the Internet at https://www3.natick.arm y.mil under the Business Opportunities heading. This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offe rors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a con tract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award . Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation, and its importance t o agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2005.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2005. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  1. Military Operations in Urban Terrain (objectives focus on military operations in urban and restricted domains and unmanned a erial and ground vehicles for urban operations); 2. Food Service/Field Service (objectives focus on combat food service equipment for individual and group feeding, and unit/organization equipment); 3. Combat Ration Research and Development; 4. Warrior Syst ems Technologies (objectives focus on ballistic protection for individuals, chemical/biological protection for individuals, flame and thermal protection for the individual soldier, countersurveillance, body worn smart materials, head mounted, hand held, bo dy-worn systems and smart-lightweight electronic components/modules for information management, biomechanics, materials nanotechnology, lightweight conformal solar cells, anthropometry, advanced protection and integration technologies and systems, and warr ior performance); 5. Tentage, Fabric Structures and Rigid Wall Shelters; 6. Airdrop - Advanced Personnel and Cargo Airdrop Systems; 7. Textile Technologies; 8. Modeling and Simulation (objectives focus on individual and small unit performance and survivabi lity, and airdrop system combat worth simulation); 9.

This is a Small Business Set Aside, the North American Industrial Classification Code is 332911 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Yuma Area Office, Yuma Desalting Plant, has a requirement for Tricentric Butterfly Valves and Actuators to be used on high pressure pumps.  BACKGROUND:  Reclamation is currently in the process of replacing a number of existing high pressure pump valves and actuators.  The existing high pressure pump butterfly valves have seen limited service but because of the ph of water being processed, the aluminum bronze disks of the butterfly valves have eroded to the point the valves no longer provide a positive seal.  A second problem associated with the various valves has been the motor operated valve actuators are undersized for the typical operating pressures of the desalting plant.  Reclamation has been in the process of replacing the valves and actuators over the years as a design deficiency.  Reclamation plans to purchase the final set of replacement valves and all of the remaining associated actuators.

<DESC>The United Stated Postal Service (USPS) is soliciting proposals from fuel suppliers to provide pumping services of diesel fuel to designated Highway Contract Route (HCR) suppliers at 22 locations in the United States. These HCR suppliers transport mail for the USPS.  The fuel provided to these HCR suppliers must be purchased from Designated Fuel Suppliers (DFSs) named by the USPS.    In the future, the USPS may add requirements to fuel USPS vehicles at the Hosts as well.  The USPS will specify the number and location of the fueling supplier sites and over time may increase, decrease, or change the Host sites.

The USPS anticipates awarding multiple contracts to multiple offerors to provide site fueling services for vehicles that are operated by HCR suppliers.

This solicitation is intended to procure diesel fueling services within a reasonable proximity (as determined by USPS) of 22 Postal Facilities locations.  All references to volumes of fuel are to be considered estimated annual gallons only.  There will be no guaranteed minimum quantities either by location or overall.  Based upon the best interests of the USPS, the USPS may not award all sites or may not award the total estimated volume to one offeror at a given location.

In addition to the facilities listed in Attachment B, the USPS may also be interested in additional Host sites within reasonable proximity (as determined by the USPS) of other large USPS facilities.

Fuel supplier must provide fuel facilities and services including ordering, receiving, storing, and dispensing of fuel to all HCR vehicles designated by the USPS.  USPS will pay for installation of USPS owned card reader systems to be installed on selected fuel supplier(s) site.  All fuel costs, including pumping fees, will be paid to fuel supplier by HCR.

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate a seven month contract with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for a project entitled “Determination of the Most Appropriate Outcome Variables Using the Project MATCH Data Set.” The proposed contract will provide analysis of the Project MATCH data set, specifically information from the Drinker Inventory of Consequences Instrument, to analyze the relationship of problems to drinking measures, time course and patterns of relapse, individual versus group level change, modifying factors, and related methodological issues.

Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is uniquely qualified to perform this work because they initially conceptualized and developed the approach to using consequences data in conjunction with drinking data to express outcome results, empirically validated the approach, and have continued to develop this line of research over the years. They also have extensive experience working with the large and multi-layered Project MATCH data sets that gives them the ability to be the most effective and efficient in completing the contract requirements. Inquiries must be made in writing, telephone inquiries are unacceptable. Inquiries should be submitted to NIAAA no later than May 2, 2003. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NA DESCRIPTION: - 1.  CONTRACTING INFORMATION:  One (1) Indefinite Delivery contract for Construction Phase Services for Military, Civil and Work for Others, primarily in California, Nevada, and Utah and other locations in the boundaries of the South Pacific Division of the U. S. Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, PL 92-582, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualificat ions for the required work. The projects will primarily be within the boundary of the Sacramento District's Sacramento and Valley Resident Offices; however, some projects may be within the jurisdiction of the Utah Resident Office.  Firm Fixed Price Task Or ders will be negotiated for the work.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541330, which has a business size standard of maximum $4 million in average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years.  R esponses to this announcement will be accepted from all responsible firms, regardless of business size.  However, eligibility for award will be based on the following cascading order of precedence: 1st  consideration:  8(a) Program; 2nd  consideration:  Sm all Business Set-Aside; and 3rd  consideration:  Full and Open Competition.  The Government will use the following methodology to establish eligibility for contract award:  (1)  In addition to the other information required to be submitted, each firm respo nding to this announcement must indicate their size status under the specified NAICS code and must also state if they are currently certified as an 8(a) small business concern.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, the Government will presume that all 8(a ) small business concerns desire to compete for an award under the 8(a) Program.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, the Government will also presume that all small business concerns, including certified 8(a) small business concerns, desire to compete f or an award under the Small Business Set-aside.  Small business concerns receiving an award under either the 8(a) Program or a Small Business Set-aside will be subject to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. (2)  Initially the Government will only  evaluate the qualifications of the A-E firms which have stated that they are competing for the award under the authority of the 8(a) Program.  The award resulting from this announcement will be made on a competitive basis to an eligible 8(a) business conc ern, provided that a minimum of three of the competing 8(a) A-E firms are determined to be highly qualified (e.g., are 'short-listed') and that the Government is able to negotiate a fair market price with one of the short-listed firms. (3)  If responses ar e not received from at least three eligible 8(a) firms that are considered by the Government to be highly qualified for this procurement, or if the Government is not able to successfully negotiate a fair market price with one of the highly qualified 8(a) f irms, then this procurement will be automatically withdrawn from the 8(a) Program and HUBZone small business concerns and the acquisition will be conducted as a 'Small Business Set-Aside'.  At this point the Government will only evaluate the responses rece ived from all eligible small business concerns, including 8(a) small business concerns.  Award will be made to a responsible small business A-E concern, provided that a minimum of three small businesses are determined to be highly qualified (e.g. short-lis ted) and the Government is able to negotiate a fair market price with one of the short-listed firms.  (4)  If responses are not received from at least three eligible small business firms that are considered by the Government to be highly qualified (e.g., s hort-listed) for this procurement, or if the Government is not able to successfully negotiate a fair market price with one of the highly qualified small bus iness firms, then the small business set-aside will be cancelled and the procurement will be conducted on an unrestricted basis, e.g., the award will be made on the basis of full and open competition from all responsible competing business concerns.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  The recommended goal for the work intended to be subcontracted is 57.2% small business.  Out of the 57.2% to small business, 8.9% is for small disadvant aged business (subset to small business); 8.1% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business); 3.0% is for HUBZone small business (subset to small business), and 3.0 is for Service Disabled small business(subset to small business). The firms selected for these contracts will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date.  If the selected firms submit a plan with lesser goals, they must submit written rationales of why the above goals were not met.  A detailed plan is not  required to be submitted with the SF 255; however, the plans to do so should be specified in block 10 of the SF 255.  If award is made to an 8(a) firm, the contract will include a base year with four one-year options, with the contract amount for each per iod not to exceed $1,000,000.  If award is made to other than an 8(a) firm, the contract will include a base year with two one-year options, with the contract amount for each period not-to-exceed $1,000,000.00.  Yearly cumulative amount of individual task orders per contract shall not exceed $1,000,000.00, unless contract capacity is rolled over from one period to the following period, if the options are exercised, nor will any individual task order exceed $1,000,000.00.  If the contract amount for the base  year period or preceding option year periods has been exhausted or nearly exhausted, the Government has the option to exercise the contract option period before the expiration of the base year period or preceding option year periods.  The negotiated contr act rates for the base year will be in effect for one year from the date of contract award.  If an option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract award.  The estimated contract start date is May 2003 and the base period of the contract will be a period of 12 months (through May 2004).

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to the teaming partnership of ANSER Analytical Services, Inc., and IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS involved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   The follow-on (Phase II) of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS.  ANSER has specific and unique expertise in national and homeland security history and policy through its Institute of Homeland Security that are vital to the success of the effort.   ANSER will provide a comprehensive resource for connecting with other U.S. Government agencies and non-governmental organizations, as well as other resources and databases on terrorism. This teaming arrangement will provide the required technical and subject matter expertise to deliver Phase II of the CSM.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego intends to negotiate a sole-source contract modification with Undersea Sensor Systems, Inc. (USSI) under the existing contract N66001-01-C-5006.  This modification will revise the Statement of Work, extend the period of performance of the base period to 19 Dec 2005, and increase the ceiling by $6,387,134, inclusive of options. Authority to process this modification as a sole source action is provided under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The technical requirements for the Autonomous Sensor Node (ASN) array design have been revised to include auxiliary heading and depth sensors consisting of 15 heading sensors and 3 depth sensors and interface software to integrate system data into the array data stream, an acoustic source for estimating radial distances between hydrophones and magnetometers after deployment, and array-cable heading and depth sensors.  In addition to the design changes the modification increases contractor support to include a Government Software Design Review, support for additional array testing, testing in foreign waters, and hardware refurbishment.  USSI has reached a point in design and preparation for the production of the ASN array that would result in a substantial duplication of effort and cost as well as time delays to develop technical capabilities should another source be used.  It is not expected that these costs could be recovered through competition.  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.  Questions concerning this sole source modification may be directed to Colleen Ferguson at colleen.ferguson@navy.mil.

<DESC>We intend to issue a sole source contract to Analytical Sciences, Inc for the period of one year, starting Apr 16, 2003 through Apr 15, 2004 for the purpose of maintaining the National Prevention Information Network (NPIN).  A brief description of the NPIN follows:

The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) has the primary responsibility within the CDC and the US Public Health Service for the prevention and control of HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and tuberculosis (TB), including community-based HIV prevention activities and syphilis and TB elimination programs.  To support NCHSTP’s mission and to link Americans to prevention, education, and care services, the CDC  National Prevention Information Network (NPIN) serves as the US reference, referral and distribution service for information on HIV/AIDS, STDs, and TB.  NPIIN is a critical member of the network of government agencies, community organizations, businesses, health professionals, educators, and human services providers that educate the American public about the grave threat to public health posed by HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB, and provides services for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  Through its toll-free numbers, NPIN also receives calls from the general public requesting information on a wide range of topics, including bioterrorism, smallpox vaccine and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and refers callers to the proper CDC Center/Institute/Office Abbreviations (CIOs) for assistance.  Additionally, other CIOs throughout CDC use the NPIN contract as a mechanism for their respective prevention and education services.

This contract will serve various audiences in the United States, its territories and Puerto Rico with information services which provide responses to questions and concerns, making referrals to national, state and local resource networks, and fulfilling orders for informational publications through its clearinghouse operations.

This sole source contract is a short-term measure.  The CDC plans to issue a solicitation for a revised NPIN contract within 6 months.

INTRODUCTION:  US Air Force Rome Laboratory, acting as the contracting agent for the Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is issuing this BAA to solicit research proposals addressing innovative solutions to cyber-defense for the Intelligence Community's  (IC) information infrastructure.  This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following two areas:  1. Advanced Information Assurance (IA) Situational Awareness; 2. Cyber Indications and Warning.   For this BAA, each of the above research efforts is subdivided into general and specific research areas of interest.  Depending upon availability of funding, ARDA anticipates the award of multiple proposals, but not all acceptable proposals will be awarded.  II. GENERAL INFORMATION.  An individual proposal may address only one of the two main research areas identified above. However, multiple proposals may be submitted by a single offeror. The research area of primary interest should be clearly identified in the proposal. Proposals must also clearly identify, by BAA paragraph number, the subtopic(s) within the main research area that the proposal is addressing.  Multiple subtopics within a research area may be addressed within a single proposal.  However, where multiple research topics are addressed, separate technical, cost and deliverable information must be provided for the work proposed.  Teaming between industry, independent research centers and academia is encouraged, and commercial technology may be leveraged wherever possible. According to DFARS 235.017-1, certain Federal Labs may submit proposals. For eligible Federal Labs, partnering with a university or private company is not required. From DFARS 235.017-1:  "DoD-sponsored FFRDC's that function primarily as research laboratories (C3I Laboratory operated by the Institute for Defense Analysis, Lincoln Laboratory operated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Software Engineering Institute) may respond to solicitations and announcements for programs which promote research, development, demonstration, or transfer of technology (Section 217, Pub.L.103-337)." DoD- and DOE-sponsored FFRDCs may also respond to this BAA. The full list of DoD-and DOE-sponsored FFRDCs is maintained by the National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/nsf03308/start.htm).  The government shall have unlimited rights to all technical data and software that directly result from this research. The Government may, at its sole discretion, require that research results be documented in a paper suitable for publication in a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or professional journal. Period of Performance: Phase 1 shall be a base period of 18 months after contract award and incrementally funded in FY03 and FY04. Phase 2 shall be for a period of 12 months and be exercised as an option in FY05 and FY06.  Total Funding: Funding for the base effort (FY03/FY04- Phase 1) is anticipated to be $5,000,000 and for the Option effort (FY05/FY06- Phase 2) is anticipated to be $4,000,000. Multiple awards are anticipated.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $9,000,000.  Individual Awards: Phase 1 (FY03/FY04) awards are expected to be in the range of  $500K to $1,500k with a possible option year award bringing the total to in excess of 2 million dollars.  The amount of the award will vary according to the type of effort undertaken.  This BAA will remain open for 3 years after the publishing date. The first round deadline is 45 days from publication of this BAA.  III.  BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is a large and complex structure of many different Federal organizations. The essential role of the IC is to provide timely, relevant information to U.S. policymakers, decision makers, and war fighters. Accomplishing this mission involves tasking, collecting, processing, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to a variety of customers.  It requires a specialized information infrastructure and a unique security environment that must work behind the scenes and often in highly charged international situations where intelligence information has the potential to remain highly sensitive for many years. In this environment, the stakes are high and confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IC information is extremely critical. For example, due to inadequate security, entire generations of collection or cryptanalytical systems may be compromised, thus reducing intelligence capabilities and wasting large amounts of investments. Further, leaks of information may have international political ramifications and cause lives to be in danger. The risk of compromise will increase as the IC continues to use commercial technologies and share its information electronically among intelligence officers, across agencies and with ad hoc coalition partners. The IC has always been responsible for ensuring that its information is secure. In the non-cyber arena, the IC developed robust systems and procedures to defend its data, sources, and methods. The IC's cyber environment demands the same risk management approach.  The Advanced Research and Development Activity (Appendix A) seeks innovative solutions for advanced cyber-defensive capabilities for the Intelligence Community (IC) information infrastructure.  Intelligence is as much a key part of cyber-defense as it is in kinetic warfare.  There are two major components to cyber defense: IA situational awareness and cyber indications and warning. Both of these capabilities help IC decision makers understand the defensive status of the IC information infrastructure and what could happen in cyberspace between a potential adversary and the defenders of the IC information infrastructure. These two components of cyber-defense are needed to better defend the IC systems and networks. They are also necessary to derive meaningful conclusions from the security incident data the IC collects, to understand the "Big Picture" of the IC networks security state, and to pinpoint security weaknesses for correction.  Both cyber defense capabilities are immature and require advanced technologies to include: presentation techniques, modeling of IC mission dependency versus IC system services, and fusion of cyber data with real-world information such as news stories and intelligence reports.  IV. OBJECTIVES:  Proposals are invited for innovative demonstrable solutions, i.e. proofs of concept, to advance the state of the art in cyber-defense capabilities for the Intelligence Community's information infrastructure.  Efforts that leverage existing technologies as a means of achieving research goals are acceptable, but efforts that are largely engineering in nature or that represent only incremental improvements to existing capabilities will not be funded. Technologies sought under this solicitation must be highly resistant to subversion or circumvention by a sophisticated adversary.  Respondents must demonstrate confidence in the effectiveness of their solution to resist attack through assurance arguments that address techniques, processes, methodologies, etc. employed to resist subversion and circumvention.  The following basic desirable features must be incorporated into any proposed solution: - Ease of Use:  User interfaces should be easy to use and be free of internal complexities.  Complexity in the user interface fosters disuse and/or potential security breaching work-arounds.  -Operational Transparency:  Solutions should minimize the visibility of protection and tracking mechanisms, thereby complicating user formulation of breaching strategies.  -Portability: Wherever possible solutions should be effective across a broad spectrum of platforms and technologies within the IC information infrastructure.  Solutions should be capable of dynamically accommodating a potentially fast-changing security environment, including changes to threat conditions, mission imperatives and personnel status.  V. RESEARCH AREAS:  5.1 General Research Interests in IA Situational Awareness.  The intent of IA Situational Awareness is to help security analysts and decision makers: - 	Visualize and understand the cyber defensive environment of their information infrastructure; - Identify what infrastructure components are important to complete key functions; - Understand a potential adversary's courses of actions to adversely effect the critical infrastructure components; and - Where to look for key indicators of malicious activity.  It involves the normalization of disparate sensor data, the deconfliction and correlation of sensor data and the display of the results of this analysis. Situational awareness is an integral part of the IC's Information Assurance Common Operational Picture (IA COP). The intent of the IA COP is to provide a graphical, statistical and analytical view of the status of the IC's computer networks and defensive posture. The concept of an IA COP is not new, but several efforts to establish such a capability have achieved limited success. Details about the desired capabilities of an IA COP are provided in DoD Instruction 8530.2, Enclosure E4, Section E4.3.1 ( Appendix B).  Despite the importance of an IA Situational Awareness capability and its strategic and operational significance, it is a very immature capability. The aim of this research is to develop new theories, technologies, and tools that significantly improve current IA situational awareness capabilities.  5.1.1	Specific Research Interests.  5.1.1.1	Decision Support and Human-Computer Interface.  Security analysts must analyze large volumes of data from existing sensors and network management systems.  Emerging research technology will present even more and varied information to the analysts.  Technology is needed to help security analysts deconflict, correlate and understand large volumes of data that support answering the questions that are important to them as decision-makers. Research into how best to design the human-computer interface to cyber situation awareness systems is needed in order to better fit the cognitive processes used by the analysts.  Even with the most advanced technology, cyber sensors are providing more data than can be easily analyzed without some sort of automation.  A particularly difficult problem is finding trends and patterns in attacks or probes that may be in progress.  The purpose of this research is to produce techniques, technologies and systems to:  - Transform huge volumes of cyber sensor and network management data into a form that can take advantage of human cognitive processing and the functions that security analysts perform; and  - Communicate intrusion information to decision makers in manner that better shows the cyber situation, including focus on trends, priority of events requiring immediate attention, and projection of the situation to better enable prompt, safe, and appropriate action in response to a security event.  ARDA seeks new ideas for situational awareness that go beyond simply prioritizing existing events.  We seek techniques and technologies that abstract events and present these abstractions in a way that enhances the overall situation awareness and facilitates decision-making.  Techniques that can quickly and dependably show defensive activity and stealthy intrusive behavior together with other related factors are desirable.  In addition, ARDA seeks innovative tools and techniques that: - Provide timely assessments of emerging IA conditions across IC networks to include identification of vulnerabilities, the status of IA Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) compliance and the defensive posture of components within the IC information infrastructure; - Provide various levels of event abstractions and present them in a way that enhances the overall IA situational awareness and facilitate decision-making at different echelon levels within the IC; -  Automatically generate reports that can be immediately transmitted (via email, for example) to customer organizations; - Assist IC information infrastructure defenders to answer security related "what if" scenarios; and  - Reduce the current manpower-intensive process of collecting, normalizing, analyzing, interpreting and reporting of information about past, current, and evolving security events to include related world events.  5.1.1.2 Modeling. One of the biggest problems in understanding security events (i.e. intrusion alerts) is appreciating how the data relates to the mission of an organization.  A major reason for this situation is the lack of understanding of the coupling between the mission and the enabling information system services.   The intent of this research is to develop modeling techniques to better determine how critical IC mission functions depend on the underlying information system services. The goal is to capture the intricate web of dependencies between missions and system services to include cascading effects between them. Research into how to project the impact of both abstract attack descriptions and known attacks using a model of system mission and system service dependencies is also desired.  Ideas on how to quantitatively measure mission impact, and ways to instrument a system to actually measure the impact are also welcomed.  ARDA seeks the development of models that demonstrate how critical IC functions are dependent on information system services and the cascading effort when elements of the model are impacted by an attack.
5.1.1.3 Fusion and Attack Recognition.  Assuming there is a capability to properly abstract and prioritize intrusion information, there remains the hard problem of making sense out of the data in the large context of what else is happening inside and outside of the system in which the observations are made.  Internal context could include the overall state of the system load, the mode it is in (wartime versus peacetime), current policy and perhaps threat condition that is in effect.  External context could include world events such as a regional war, terrorist threats, or some major upgrade that is planned for a system.  Such context can dramatically effect the interpretation of the observed events.  There are four levels of fusion in the context of physical sensors. These levels seem appropriate as a starting point for this research.  Level 1 is called Object Refinement and its primary purpose is identification.  Level 1 is concerned with entity detection and recognition.  In the cyberspace, this level would consist of schemes that identify events as part of a larger action such as an attack sequence and actually recognizes the particular attack.  Level 2 is called Situation Refinement and its primary purpose is situation assessment.  Level 2 is concerned with event aggregation and context interpretation.  In cyberspace, this might mean the aggregation of a probe sequence for mapping, followed by an attack on a given host, followed by the use of that host to get to a target system as an aggregation of a higher-level attack sequence.  Level 3 is called Threat Refinement and is concerned with threat analysis in terms of where an adversary has been and where he might be going.  Level 4 is called Process Refinement and is concerned with the meta-data level which associates threats to the defenders strategic interests and projects the threat potential against our own dynamic vulnerability state.  The goal of this research is to develop cyber event fusion technology to provide interpretation and a meaningful context to cyber events.  Ideas on technology are welcome at all four fusion level, but in the interest of building a strong foundation, emphasis in this round will be on fusion levels 1 and 2. In addition, ADRA seeks advanced tools and techniques to: - Normalize, aggregate, correlate, and fuse data from a wide range of disparate host, and network security event sensors that are deployed across the IC; - Assist defenders of the IC information infrastructure find trends and patterns in attacks or probes that may be in progress; 5.2 General Research Interests in Cyber Indications and Warning.  Today's information assurance paradigm is a reactive model that involves detection of, and reaction to attacks once they are underway. There is a pressing need to become predictive and proactive in detecting pre-attack cyber events that occur before malicious activities during the attack stage.  This capability should significantly increase the warning time for an attack and provide IC security analysts and decision makers the time to take preventive steps to minimize the impact and losses from cyber-attacks.  Joint Publication 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms defines Indications and warning (I&W) as those intelligence activities intended to detect and report the imminence of hostilities.  More detailed information about cyber I&W is provided in DoD Instruction 8530.2, Enclosure E4.3.2 (Appendix C).  During the Cold War, the United States developed robust systems to preclude surprise from nuclear and conventional threats. Unlike these areas, observables related to a campaign of cyber attacks have not been fully developed and cyber I&W remains a challenge that needs to be addressed. Because attack forecasting or cyber I&W provides the early warning necessary to reconfigure adaptive response mechanisms within the IC information infrastructure, it represents a key element for ensuring the survivability of IC information systems and networks. This portion of the BAA focuses on the detection and analysis of pre-attack observables. Observables are information derived from knowledge about the capabilities and tools an adversary could use during the pre-attack stage and security events that are embedded in network traffic. For example, it would be useful to know that the probe rate on a component within the IC information infrastructure has increased and that the attempted stealthiness of those probes has increased. This combined with other information could indicate an adversary's intention to hide the probes and could be an indication of something bigger.  ARDA selected this aspect of I&W to create focus and to highlight its particular importance and relevance to the IC. This focus should allow offerors to concentrate on a small part of the I&W problem.  The intent of this research is to demonstrate that an adversary's attack intentions can be reliably predicted by an intelligence process that correlates technical information available in network traffic with information about the adversary's capabilities. ARDA is particularly interested in I&W capabilities for sophisticated attacks and where the network sensors are deployed to detect observables in an asymmetric network environment i.e. sensors have access to one, but not both portions of the two way network traffic. ADRA defines sophisticated attacks as those attacks that are nation-state sponsored and therefore have access to almost unlimited resources and capabilities. Due to the need to limit this research to an unclassified environment, this research will focus on an examination of real-world hacker pre-attack activities, the exploits of open source vulnerabilities, open source hacker information and attacks on the NIPRNet i.e. the IC's unclassified network.  5.2.1 Specific Research Interests.  
5.2.1.1   Prediction Technologies:  ARDA seeks the demonstration of new and novel methodologies and supporting technologies for predicting cyber-attacks that are based on an understanding, of attackers pre attack activities within unclassified networks used by the IC i.e. NIPRNet.  This research includes the characterization and testing of pre-attack network observables (indicators). Respondents must demonstrate a prototype capability that correlates network observables with information about the attacker's threat profile. Based on this research, ARDA seeks  a prototype capability that significantly increases the warning time associated with a cyber attacks on the NIPRNet. SEE PART II OF II PUBLISHED IN FBO.

Kloven, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4767, email: Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  ARDA also desires metrics that indicate the increase in warning time that the solution provides for various classes of attacks.  5.2.1.2 Modeling Strategic Cyber Attack Scenarios.  While it is possible for attackers to do serious damage with little preparation and with little prior observables, we expect that large-scale strategic cyber campaigns targeted at major IC capabilities will require a more serious preparation and will leave larger footprints or detectable observables.  We expect reconnaissance to be more sophisticated in that adversaries will have to create accurate models and test beds of the target system on which to test their attack campaigns before initiating an attack.  It is also anticipated that adversaries will perform live tests of several aspects of the attack, and then put into place mechanisms (trojanized commands, logic bombs backdoors on systems, new buffer overflow exploits or other malicious software) that can be triggered in an orchestrated series of events.  All of these activities create potentially observable events from within or external to the IC information infrastructure. The goal of this research is to create models of strategic cyber attack scenarios and to develop ways of systematically detecting the observable points in the models.  The models need to include time sequence events and the projection of those events onto a defender system. For example, reconnaissance will look like a series of probes and the observables could be the probes themselves, probably attempting to go low and slow to avoid detection. In this case the methods for observation could be probe detectors that look for low and slow kinds of probes. The penetration phase attack may exhibit some observables prior to the attack occurring.  ARDA seeks research into technologies and techniques that develop and demonstrate such models in the context of creating indications and warning of major strategic cyberwar campaigns against the IC information infrastructure.  5.2.1.4  Sensor Grid – Detecting Observables.  For the most part, existing intrusion detection systems have made use of event streams that were designed for other purposes (operating system audit logs, network data packets, etc.).  This has proven useful, but severely limits the detection of pre-attack activities.  Specialized cyber sensors need to be developed that are optimized to detect pre-attack events and observables for indications and warning.  The intent of this research is to design a suite of sensors that are specifically suited for the detection of important cyber events/observables that indicate a pending cyber attack. Schemes for working backwards from attacks or attack classes to derive the best sensor designs are of interest to ARDA. Sensor coverage of the most important events and tunability will be considerations in the quality of design. Architectures are also sought for deploying these specialized sensors within a defended IC network in such a way that adversaries are likely to run into them for the tasks that they must accomplish to achieve the results they seek.  Sensor deployment architectures with rationale are sought both conceptually and in conjunction with proposed suites of specialized sensors. Leveraging sensor design techniques and concepts from related domains such as the realm of physical sensors is encouraged.  As part of this sensor grid research, ARDA also seeks innovative ideas on developing sensor technology that can detect and defeat adversary attempts to deceive the sensors or manipulate the sensors to the adversary's advantage in masking this behavior.

APPENDIX: APPENDIX A: Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA) for Information Technology ARDA (http://www.ic-arda.org/) is a joint Department of Defense and Intelligence Community organization that was established in December 1998. While the ARDA office is organizationally part of the National Security Agency, ARDA's mission is to incubate revolutionary Research and Development (R&D) activities within the broad field of Information Technology for the shared benefit of the Intelligence Community. In order to satisfy this mission, ARDA, in close cooperation with its Intelligence Community partners, originates and manages advanced R&D programs that:  1. Will have fundamental impact on future Intelligence Community operational needs and strategies;
2. Demand substantial, long-term venture investment to spur risk-taking; 3. Progress measurably toward mid-term and final goals; and 4.Take many forms and employ many delivery vehicles.  This BAA has been developed under ARDA's guidance and direction by representatives from a number of Intelligence Community Agencies that include NIMA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and the National Security Agency (NSA).  The US Air Force Rome Laboratory has agreed to issue the solicitation. The evaluation of proposals, the selection of awardees, the execution of the resulting contracts, and the overall management of the proposals awarded from this BAA will be accomplished under the guidance and direction of ARDA.  Appendix B  - DoD Instruction 8530.2, Enclosure E4, Section E4.3.1.  E4.3.1.	 Situational awareness is the key to effective CND.  A robust situational awareness capability is mandated by the highly interconnected nature of the DoD information systems and computer networks; the degree to which they share risk; and the coordination and synchronization requirements of response efforts.  Situational awareness is enabled by an interoperable suite of information systems that collectively support and comprise a Common Operational Picture (COP).  E4.3.l.l. Constructing a COP is a top down and a bottom up endeavor.  A common operational picture is required that is both Defense-wide and tailored to a hierarchy of decision-makers in a dynamic command and control construct.  Managing and collecting information in and for a dynamic environment is inherently complex.  Many factors contribute to that complexity, for example:  E4.3.l.l.l. The optimum set off data elements is inherently dynamic, changing as the computer networks environment, the DoD operational environment and the threat change, as the DoD CND capability matures, and as technology evolves to support CND.  Additionally, the optimum subset for decision support changes as control shifts up and down the operational hierarchy.  E4.3.l.l.2. Both the optimal and the obtainable refresh rates for the required data elements are inherently dynamic.  Each rate is continuously moving toward real time but is constrained by the rates of the set itself in that extremely disparate refresh rates among individual data elements can distort or falsify the resulting fused picture.  E4.3.1.2.  The major Components of the CND COP are: E4.3.l.2.l. A shared picture of the DoD global information and computing networks and the military and business operations they support, to include notice of any impending changes in configuration, capacity, utilization, assurance posture, user priorities, or criticality of support for military operations.  An understanding and visualization of these global systems is required for all Network Operations elements – network management, information dissemination management, and information assurance – therefore, the development and maintenance of the network operational picture is not the exclusive responsibility of CND.  Rather, the CND COP incorporates and builds upon the operational picture of the DoD global network COP that is common to all Network Operations elements.  E4.3.l.2.2. A shared picture of the threat developed from all sources.  These sources include foreign intelligence; Federal law enforcement; National counterintelligence; Defense Law enforcement, Defense counterintelligence, other security sources; private sector infrastructure service and computer emergency response providers and, other open sources E.O. 12333 (reference (i)) applies to both DoD and non-DoD intelligence and counterintelligence units.  DoD Directive 5240.l (reference (j)) and DoD 5240.1-R (reference (k)) govern the activities of all DoD intelligence units and non-intelligence units performing intelligence activities.  
E4.3.l.2.3. A shared picture of CND operations, e.g., effective INFOCON levels and status of compliance, status and compliance of IAVAs, schedule and status of VAAs, status of CND COA development and execution, as well as impending changes to CND services.
E4.3.l.3. In addition to a Defense-wide shared picture, the COP seeks to enable contributing communities by promoting "community specific COPs."  Communities may be organizational, e.g., DoD Component, or functional, e.g., the Defense Law Enforcement community.  The community specific COPs are intended to: 
E4.3.l.3.l. Provide the ability to collect, organize, process, manage and disseminate CND related information within the community at a level of detail greater than the CND COP. 
E4.3.1.3.2. Support the development and improvement of standard processes for community support to CND.  E4.3.l.3.3. Support the standardization and availability of information required for the DoD CND COP  E4.3.l.4.  Tier l:  The USCINCSPACE establishes CND requirements for the CND COP.  The certification authorities maintain common Defense-wide aspects of the COP by:  E4.3.l.4.l. Contributing Component and relevant functional CND information to the COP.  E4.3.l.4.2. Coordinating informational needs with Tier 2 entities to ensure a Defense-wide CND COP.  E4.3.l.4.3. Assisting Tier 2 entities to meet reporting and information input requirements.  E4.3.l.5. Tier 2 CNDS providers support situational awareness by:  E4.3.l.5.l. Working with and supporting the CND Architect and the CND Systems Integrator to identify requirements, and to develop, deploy and maintain information systems.  E4.3.l.5.2. Working with serviced Tier 3 entities and Components to ensure that CND COP information is timely and accurate.  E4.3.l.5.3. Working with serviced Components to identify Component-unique requirements and support their development, deployment and maintenance.  E4.3.l.5.4. Assisting Tier 3 entities to meet reporting and information input requirements.  E4.3.l.6. Tier 3 supports situational awareness by complying with reporting requirements and providing information inputs to the COP.  Appendix C  - DoD Instruction 8530.2, Enclosure E4, Section E4.3.2  E4.3.2.	Indications and Warning (I&W) is defined as those intelligence activities intended to detect and report time-sensitive intelligence information on foreign developments that could involve a threat to the United States or allied/coalition military, political, or economic interests or to U. S. citizens abroad.  It includes forewarning of enemy actions or intentions; the imminence of hostilities; insurgency; nuclear/non-nuclear attack on the United States, its overseas forces, or allied/coalition nations; hostile reactions to U. S. reconnaissance activities; terrorists' attacks; and other similar events.  E4.3.2.1. Tier 1:  The USCINSPACE provides the Intelligence Community (IC) with priority intelligence requirements (PIR) and indications and warning requirements for potential attacks against DoD information systems and computer networks.  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) coordinates IC support to the USCINSPACE.  E4.3.2.2. Tier 2:  DoD Components provide PIR input to the USCINSPACE, and in coordination with the USCINSPACE and DIA, determine direct intelligence support to the CNDS providers.  E4.3.2.3. Tier 3 implements Tier 1 and Tier 2 direction.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, under $100K.  Because EDNES is upgrading and extending its own product, this notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned..  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation notice for the deployment of a COTS product for a Time and Attendance System in support of the United States Capitol Police (USCP) Administrative Systems Modernization Program.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Time and Attendance (T&A) System will be a full and open competition.  The USCP intends to award a Time and Materials (T&M) contract for the implementation of a T&A System with a 1-year option period for a not-to-exceed period of performance of 24 months.  All contractors interested in proposing on this effort are expected to propose a solution that is COTS based and must be able to be interfaced with existing systems.  All requirements must be met and contractors are encouraged to propose alternate approaches to addressing the requirements that would result in improved services and/or reduced costs to the USCP.  The contractor will be required to provide the proposed application description and features, and address the tasking identified in the RFP.  The USCP anticipates a two-phased selection approach.  The 1st phase will determine those offerors that are within the competitive range and evaluating those proposals based on the technical capability and the ability to meet the requirements.  The 2nd phase will consist of evaluating offerors based on scripted demonstrations.

The following identifies the major milestones for the process the USCP has identified regarding the T&A System selection:  1) release RFP; 2) hold bidders conference on May 1, 2003; 3) receive proposals; 4) determine competitive range (CR); 5) evaluate CR proposals; 6) hold scripted demonstrations; 7) evaluate demonstrations; 8) make award.  Questions from contractors regarding the RFP must be submitted to the Contracting Officer at USCP_Procurement@cap-police.senate.gov no later than April 25, 2003.  The bidders conference will be held at the Holiday Inn Washington – On the Hill, 415 New Jersey Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001 on May 1, 2003 from 9:00am to 12:00pm.  Contractors are limited to 3 attendees and must attend the conference in order to submit a proposal.  Any contractor that submits a proposal but did not attend the bidders conference will have the proposal disqualified for this competition.  Once the competitive range is determined, the Contracting Officer will notify all contractors and provide additional information to those contractors that are selected for scripted demonstrations.  The USCP anticipates no extensions will be given for this RFP.

Proposals must be submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than 11:00am on May 5, 2003 or submissions will not be considered for this effort.  Proposals may be submitted electronically to the USCP_Procurement@cap-police.senate.gov.  Hard copies must be hand delivered, do not use a national carrier for delivery, to the U.S. Capitol Police, 119 D St., NE, Washington, DC 20510, Attn: Karen M.S. Hiltz, OFM, Procurement Division.  Verification of receipt is the responsibility of the contractor.  Proposals that meet the stated requirements will be further evaluated for past performance and costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Thermo Finnigan for the purchase of three (3) gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers (Delta Plus Advantage Mass Spectrometer). Based on EPA's knowledge of the analytical instrumentation industry, there are features covered in the instrument specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  These features include: 1) specifications relating to system memory and design of the ion source and vacuum system; 2) the dynamic range of the collector amplifiers must allow for collection of signals over a dynamic range of 5000, corresponding from 10 mV to 50 V; 3) the mass spectrometer must allow for true differential pumping; and 4) and the software must contain documented routines for corrections of measured delta values for 17O isotopomers of CO2, CO, N2O, and SO2. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.   The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Mike Brinkmiller at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45268 or fax your request to (513)487-2115.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>AMENDED NOTICE.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a custom cryostat to be manufactured that will be able to reach temperatures of below 10mK and allow many, of order 300 to 2000, electrical wires to be connected to an experiment.  In order to meet these requirements, the cryostat is of a custom design and has to be manufactured identically to the design given by our specifications and must be completely manufactured by July 31, 2003.  The dilution refrigerator unit is being procured separately and will be installed and tested by NIST.  The specifications are for the main cryostat and its interior vacuum connections to the dilution refrigerator. The main cryostat with the liquid nitrogen and liquid helium tanks, as well as their supports and radiation shields, will be built.  This cryostat will then be transported to the NIST Boulder site to be tested for cryogen consumption rates.  These rates will be measured both before and after the main vacuum container is gold plated.  Specifications are as follows:  1) Components: Support structure.  A triangular support structure, fabricated from 2x10 lumber and plywood, is to be constructed following a CAD design file.  The lumber shall be connected via metal flanges and bolt fasteners.  The approximate length of each spoke of the triangle is 63 inches.  2) Top plate.  The 300K flange at the top of the cryostat shall be fabricated from stainless steel (SS), with dimensions of a thickness 7/8" and diameter 27".  Access holes for two cryogen fill ports and 12 feed-through ports shall be included.  3) 
Vacuum vessel.  A SS vacuum-can shall be constructed that connects to the bottom of the top plate.  The vessel shall be 45" high by 21" in diameter, with approximately 1/8" wall thickness.  The vessel shall be split into two pieces, with appropriate o-ring grooves and surfaces.  Vacuum connections with KF-40 and KF-25 flanges shall be installed on the upper vessel section.  Lift rings shall be attached to the low piece.  The design of the lower section shall be chosen to minimize its weight.  Gold plating to the inside surface of these vessels shall be applied to reduce the infrared emissivity of the surfaces so as to reduce the heat load to the 77K stage.  NIST will purchase the vacuum and relief valve for the two KF flanges.  4) 77K cryogen tank.  A liquid nitrogen tank shall be constructed with size 13" diameter and 5" long.  This tank and its fill port shall be constructed entirely with SS and SS weld joints.  The bottom flange will provide a thermal connection to the cryogen, and will be constructed from a bi-metal plate of copper and stainless steel.  Approximately 75 tapped connection holes will be connected to this surface.  The fill port will contain a seamless bellows section that will allow for small movements from thermal contraction.  The fill tube inner diameter shall be ½", and the outer diameter will be 1 ¼".   This tank shall have a 2 3/8" diameter tube welded at its centerline to accommodate the helium tank fill tube.  5) 4K cryogen tank.  A liquid helium tank shall be constructed similar to the liquid nitrogen tank, but with a length of 10".  Two additional copper heat sink connections shall be made to the fill port, with flanges available for thermal connections.  An additional siphon flange with an indium o-ring seal shall be added to the bottom of the tank.  An internal gusset support shall be installed at the upper part of this tank. 6) Thermal supports.  A thermally isolated support structure shall be installed between 300K and 77K, as well as 77K and 4K.  These supports will be made from 3 rods/sheets of G-10 material.  An additional support structure made out of metal shall be included that acts as additional mechanical support during transportation of the cryostat, and will also be used for alignment of the two cryogenic vessels to each other and the top plate.  The system will be design such that the supports are machined after the construction of the vacuum vessel so that precise alignment of all of the various stages occur automatically upon assembly, and that replacement of any of the part of the system will not require custom alignment.  7) Tank flanges.  Aluminum rings, ¼" thick and made from 6063 or 1100 Al, will connect the bottom of the two tanks and support the radiation shields.  These flanges will have 12 ports for electrical wiring access.  The holes connecting to the radiation shield flanges shall have phosphor bronze helicoils installed.  Blank-off flanges that cover the 12 ports shall be made for the two flanges.  These flanges, as well as their mating shield parts, shall have a double lipped structure to minimize the amount of infrared radiation leakage through the seals.  8) Infrared Shields.  Aluminum shields shall be attached to the two flanges at 77K and 4K to act as an infrared radiation shields.  Each shield shall have an attachment flange made from 6063 or 1100 Al with appropriate attachment holes.  The sides of the Al cans shall be made from 0.080-thick rolled Al sheet.  These shields shall be manufactured so that there is no appreciable warpage after the assembly process so that the shields do not have to be custom fit to the Al tank flanges.  Because these shields might occasionally be damaged, it is important that these flanges can be manufactured to tight enough tolerances to not necessitate custom fitting.  The 77K shield will be constructed in two parts, with a cylindrical upper section that has two attachment flanges.  The surface of the shields shall be manufactured to have a reflective surface (similar, for example, to aluminum foil) so as to reduce the emissivity of the surface.  9) Stress Modeling.  Finite element analysis shall be performed for the top flange and vacuum vessel to insure that the parts do not deform significantly or collapse upon evacuation of the vessel.  Gussets and or strength bands around the vessel shall be designed and installed as needed.  10) Conductive o-rings.  All o-rings at the external surface shall use a conductive o-ring material to enable the vessel to act as an electrical shield around the experimental section.  11) Documentation.  Documentation of the fabrication and assembly of the instrument shall be included.  Machine-shop drawings of the various pieces will be used to document the instrument as well check its design by NIST staff before construction.  A list of the suppliers and any specialty machine shops that are used for the fabrication of parts shall be supplied.  Assembly or welding instructions shall be provided, as appropriate.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Both price and technical content will be used to evaluate the proposals.  Because of the critical nature of this piece of equipment to the success of the quantum computing effort, technical merit will be weighted more heavily in the final decision, with price assuming increased importance in the differentiation between closely ranked technical proposals.  Technical merit will be evaluated by a team of three NIST scientists based on the following 3 criteria, each weighted by 33.3%: 1) Ability of manufacturer to construct scientific instruments.  Performance will be evaluated on past experience with constructing scientific instruments, especially those involving cryogenic design and fabrication methods, electromagnetic shielding, and low vibrational noise.  2) Construction techniques and ability.  Performance will be evaluated on construction techniques of the various components, judged by manufacturing techniques and the ability of the processes to hold mechanical tolerances for interchangeable components, produce reliable weld joints, and give low infrared-radiation emissivity surfaces.  3) Ability of manufacturer to communicate and collaborate with NIST.  Performance will be evaluated base on the ability of the manufacturer to communicate easily and often with NIST in order to assure proper final design and manufacturing, and to ensure that all components fit together as a cryostat system and be compatible with the dilution refrigerator unit.  Since testing is required at the NIST facility to ensure compatibility with other electronic and vacuum systems, easy transportation of the instrument to and from NIST is desirable.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This requirement is set-aside for small business unless small business cannot meet the Governments need at a reasonable cost.  Technical merit, as well as price, will be considered in selecting a vendor.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by email.  You may submit your proposal by fax or by mail.   Proposal must be received on or before close of business April 30, 2003.  Please include delivery date, F.O.B. point, business size, Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, and Dun and Bradstreet Number.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be fond on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date May 1, 2003.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of this synopsis. Salient characteristics: The U.S. Geological Survey has an ongoing requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI). The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States. Requirement is for office space on-site at the University of Memphis, as well as a graduate research assistant, GIS services, computer network access with CERI, and other miscellaneous services, including a dedicated fax line. The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from the University of Memphis, Center for Earthquake Research and Information, Memphis, Tennessee, 38152, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  See Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for "Assuring Web-based Software System Components". The purpose of the work to be performed is to identify, describe, and specify criteria, techniques, methods, and tools that would be sufficient to assess the reliability of Web-based software relevant to NASA.  It is stipulated that the assessment of reliability reflects the degree to which software interactions and outputs (based on allowed input data and initial conditions) can be proven, in a mathematical sense, to be correct and consistent with the software specifications.  The criteria, techniques, methods, and tools that will be identified, described, and specified during this task will be (when ultimately developed) applicable to assess the reliability of software systems (hereafter referred to as the target systems) implemented (or implementable) in the currently dominant, platform-independent World Wide Web languages (including Java, JavaScript, and PHP).  The scope of the work to be performed is limited in the following way: it can be assumed that Extensible Markup Language (XML) definitions/descriptions are known in advance for the data that passes among the target systems.  Further, this statement of work does not require the Contractor to actually implement any technique or tool.  This research activity will identify, describe, and specify criteria, techniques, methods, and tools for (a) evaluating the interfaces and run-time connections among interacting Web-based software components, (b) determining the semantic correctness of the interactions of Web-based software components, and (c) correctness testing of interacting Web-based software components, including generating data for such testing.  In addition, the research will describe the manner in which the criteria, techniques, methods, and tools could be applied.  The products to be delivered include written reports that present the results of the research.The deliverables required are as follows: (a)	     Report that identifies the issues and poses the criteria that are relevant for assessing the reliability of Web-based software  (b)	 Report describing, and presenting the specifications for, the criteria, techniques, methods, and tools that would be sufficient for assessing the reliability of Web-based software (c) Report analyzing, and establishing the efficacy and range of applicability of, the described criteria, techniques, methods, and tools (d)	Report describing, and giving examples of, the expected and appropriate application and use of the described criteria, techniques, methods, and tools (e)	     Report analyzing the effort required to bring representative NASA Web-based software systems into a state or condition where their reliability can be assessed using the described criteria, techniques, methods, and tools (f) Report describing feasible approaches that can be used to develop and implement Web-based software systems whose reliability can be readily assessed using the described criteria, techniques, methods, and tools The Contractor shall submit all reports stipulated above in writing to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Contracting Officer (CO) not later than the end of the period of performance.  At the contractor's option, the reports may be provided not as separate documents but instead as sections of an overall document considered as the final product of the task.  On the same schedule, the contractor shall provide an electronic copy of each report in Portable Document Format (PDF).The Government will not furnish or provide the Contractor with any equipment, supplies, or facilities. The period of performance is one year commencing on the date of award. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors who have the requisite capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the requirements stated in this synopsis are invited to submit all pertinent documentation, literature, brochures, references, and other information that support their ability to fulfill all of the Government's requirements stated herein. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Mandy Parham, NASA GSFC,Greenbelt Road, Greenblet, MD 20771,Code 210.3, Bldg 11, Rm S215G no later than April 16, 2003.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only.  It replaces previous sources sought announcement N68936-03-T-DEW1.  A solicitation is not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Weapons Division is conducting market research to determine interest in participation in outdoor field tests of High Power Microwave (HPM) Devices here forth referred to as HPM sources at the China Lake outdoor test range against NATO threat targets, for the purpose of validating effects against military targets. This test program will be managed under the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program, which provides opportunities to test items of our allies and friends in order to satisfy valid U.S. Defense requirements more quickly and economically.  This test will be a technical assessment of the capabilities of HPM sources to be used in munitions for military applications and is not a test to procure.  If the U.S. Department of Defense determines that these test items satisfy military requirements or address mission area shortcomings all HPM source hardware that show effects against targets will be considered for future acquisition or partnering opportunities.  All participants should have either HPM source or threat hardware to contribute to the effort.  All data collected will be provided to the United States Government and to the individual test parties only.  The U.S. government will not provide data from one participant to another participant.  Individual participants may or may not share data amongst themselves as their own agreements and regulations allow for.  Individual participants will be responsible for providing their own hardware, maintenance, operation and transportation of personnel and equipment.  The U.S. Government declines any responsibility for the condition and maintenance of the test hardware.  The U.S. Government will provide testing at the Etcheron Valley Outdoor HPM Test Facility at China Lake, CA.  This will include use of the test range and personnel to support testing, instrumentation, data collection, and test coordination, safety and security requirements.  Targets of interest include various foreign military systems such as radars, weapon systems, C4I, and communication systems.  All targets must be functional and able to test in an outdoor operational environment.  Susceptibility testing will be done on each target with all HPM sources thereby providing a comparison of HPM sources.  Susceptibility is defined as degradation, disruption or destruction.  Testing to the point of destruction will be avoided and agreed upon risks negotiated with the owner of each target. Submittals should include a description of the HPM source or target that is being offered and any testing parameters such as size, power input, peak power, support personnel needed, etc. required for the system.  Any previous chamber testing data that would help to define test parameters can be submitted as well.   Testing is being planned for fiscal year 2004 forth quarter (July-September 04).  Participants in the test will be considered for future procurement or developmental opportunities with the United States.  An informational meeting will be planned to discuss testing particulars after the submittals are reviewed and participants selected.  Responses should be sent to: Peggy Richter, 760-939-4272 Contract Specialist at 1 Administration Circle, Code 210000D, China Lake, CA 93555-6100.   Any classified responses and technical issues should be sent to Kelly McDonald 760-939-2539 at 1 Administration Circle, Code 472000D China Lake, CA 93555-6100.

Experience in the placement of undergraduate students with disabilities in internships is desirable but not required.  This expertise and experience should be presented in a synopsis of projects previously performed by the source.  Each synopsis should identify the name and address of the client, a description of the work performed, the dollar value of the project, the number of personnel on the project, the period of performance, and the name and telephone number of a contact at each client who is knowledgeable about the work performed by the source for the client.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is seeking information regarding potential bidders for the re-compete of the Information Technology Product Assurance (ITPA) contract.    The USPTO is requesting this information to 1) determine if small businesses capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements exist, 2) obtain feedback regarding the contract type and possible performance based measurements and incentives, and 3) obtain information that will assist in the formulation of the USPTO acquisition strategy.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY; THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.  ANY SOLICITATION WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT A LATER DATE.  NO OFFERS ARE REQUESTED OR WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.   

The current ITPA contract, which was awarded in a full and open competition, expires December 2003.  The current contract is a task order, cost-plus fixed fee contract with an estimated contract value of $34,727,293.00.   The ITPA contractor is required to provide expertise, support, and services in six disciplines:  requirements management/
engineering, quality assurance (to include statistics/measurement expertise), configuration management, independent testing and assessment, records management and data management.  The USPTO is looking for vendors who can provide a full-range or complement of services in these six disciplines.  Vendors should specifically state their capabilities and expertise in the six disciplines, demonstrated use of automated tools or packages used to support these disciplines, and any certifications or other credentials they may possess that relate specifically to these six disciplines (for example, Capability Maturity Model certifications, Quality Assurance Institute certifications, ASQ certificates, etc.).   Vendors should also provide specific examples of contracts that are of a similar scope, size, and complexity as the current ITPA contract and their participation in the contract (prime, subcontractor, consultant, etc.).   Because of the nature of this contract, a strict organizational conflict of interest clause will be incorporated into the contract.  This clause will preclude the selected vendor, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors in interest, subcontractors, or consultants from participating (in any capacity) in any other USPTO Information Technology contracts for the duration of the ITPA contract.   Therefore, when responding to this RFI, interested vendors should specifically identify any conflicts of interest that currently exist i.e., are they currently doing work with USPTO as either a prime or sub-contractor and if so on what contracts.    The USPTO also requests that vendors provide information as to the contract type (cost plus, fixed price, fixed price labor rate, etc.) and performance measurements and incentives that they feel are most appropriate to this type of contract.  

Vendors' responses, including their specific size status (large, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, as well as applicable or eligible NAICS codes) should be received in writing by COB January 10, 2003.  It is requested that vendor responses be no longer than five (5) typed pages.  The USPTO POC is Brenda Carswell, Contracting Officer 703-305-9127 or e-mail brenda.carswell@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Transisition Switch Module
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is in the planning stage of a procurement for the replacement for its current Unit Level Circuit Switch (ULCS) equipment.  The Transition Switch Module (TSM) will provide commercially available circuit switching technology to replace the aging TRI-TAC family of equipment (AN/TTC-42 and SB-3865).  It will provide all of the services currently available in USMC switching equipment in a smaller, lighter package.  Additionally, the TSM will provide enhanced multiplexing capabilities and an Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) capability.  The TSM will provide a flexible Unit Level Switch capability that bridges legacy TRI-TAC switches with current commercial technology to provide Marine maneuver elements with more robust voice/data switching, data transport, and bandwidth management capabilities.  The TSM is anticipated to be a three transit case solution that will be fielded to all units that currently have a circuit switching capability (Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through Regiment).  

To facilitate planning efforts, a DRAFT copy of the Statement of Work and Performance Soecification has been posted to MARCORSYSCOM's web site at http://.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/tsm.asp for comment.

Interested parties should submit written comments to the following address: COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2033 Barnett Ave., CODE CTQIDP, ATTN:  Ira D. Patterson, Quantico, VA 22134-5010

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) in support of the Revolutionary Approach To Time-critical Long Range Strike (RATTLRS) Flight Demonstration Project (FDP)
<DESC>FSC code AC23, NAICS code: 541710 (Guided missile and space vehicle parts (except engines) research and development).  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting information in support of the Revolutionary Approach To Time-critical Long Range Strike (RATTLRS) Flight Demonstration Project (FDP).  Sources/respondents should have a demonstrated capability to successfully design, fabricate, integrate and flight test a tactical strike-weapon-class supersonic air vehicle.  This notice requests information on project execution plans and identification of the requisite technologies to ascertaining the feasibility and risks associated with such a flight demonstration project.  The total projected technology development and flight demonstration cost is approximately $50M.  As an applied research Science and Technology demonstration, RATTLRS will culminate in flight demonstrations of an integrated air vehicle, powered only by a supersonic turbine engine, in a size/shape/weight/configuration that is traceable to a tactical weapon system.  The flight demonstration vehicle is expected to accelerate from a subsonic air launch condition to a minimum of Mach 3 using only turbine propulsion.   For RFI response purposes, assume first demonstration flight prior to 36 months after project initiation, and all flight demonstrations completed by 45 months after project initiation.  The flight vehicle to be demonstrated within RATTLRS should be a demonstration air vehicle only, having traceability to one of the following potential weapon systems:  An air-launched (compatible with the F/A-18 launch platform) medium range weapon with a maximum vehicle weight of 1800 lbs including 500 lbs payload, or a ship-launched (Vertical Launch System (VLS) compatible) long-range weapon with a maximum weight of 3400 lbs including 750 lbs payload (includes vehicle and any booster required for VLS launch), or one vehicle compatible to both launch options.  The government requests information in the following areas:  I.  An outline of a project execution plan with sections specifically addressing technical approach, risk mitigation, schedule and cost for a program that will design, fabricate, integrate, and ground/flight test a supersonic turbine-powered air vehicle.  A.  Technical Approach:  1. Provide a top-level description of the system concept development, design, development, and fabrication approach. 2. Identify and rationalize the requisite bench-scale, ground and flight demonstration phases of the project.  3. Provide rationale on how the flight demonstrations should be conducted (e.g. air or surface launched).  4.  Provide rationale for the number of flight demonstrations required for validation and risk mitigation and the objective of each flight demonstration.  5. Identify the critical technologies required for this development and demonstration, along with the initial and final Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) for each critical technology.  6. Describe the respondent’s ability to insert, mature and demonstrate previous unproven technologies within the scope of the project (i.e. component and system technologies which have not been flight demonstrated and/or demonstrated in a relevant environment).  B.  Risk Assessment:  Provide a cost, schedule, and technical performance risk assessment of the project plan and specifically include:  1.  An assessment of a turbine propulsion only, air vehicle system's ability to accelerate at 0.25 g or greater through the transonic flight region and its ability to cruise at a minimum of Mach 3.0.  2.  Overall risk reduction plans required for the successful execution of such a flight demonstration series.  3.  If achieving the flight demonstration goals within the $50M government cost estimate and/or the FY07 completion is perceived to pose an inordinate amount of risk, the government requests that the respondent identify the areas of high risk, providing rationale and suggestions to mitigate the risks.  C.  Schedule/Milestone:  Provide a GANTT chart, in MS Project, identifying the major elements of the project, including preliminary and critical design phases, fabrication, bench-scale, ground and flight demonstrations, and go-no-go decision gates.  D.  Cost:  1.  Estimate costs for the major elements of the demonstration project including but not limited to the following categories a.) concept development, preliminary design and system development, b.) bench-scale, ground and wind tunnel tests and c.) flight demonstrations (identify number of flight demonstrations and specify costs individually).  Also, the respondent should consider novel approaches for conducting the flight demonstrations to obtain maximum technology verification/validation value.  II.  Provide any information regarding current research and/or demonstrations in weapon-sized flight vehicles using supersonic turbine propulsion, and related subsystem-level research and/or demonstrations which could be matured into a flight capability and the respondent's experience and ability to predict and analyze the performance of an integrated air-vehicle system configuration utilizing a supersonic turbine engine.  Technical questions should be directed to the technical point of contact for the RATTLRS project, Curt Snyder, (301-757-0383) or email:  snydercd@navair.navy.mil.   Responses to this request shall be unclassified, and are limited to 15 pages total with no more than 10 pages total of technical information and no more than 5 pages on cost; not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.  Responses must be submitted no later than 4pm EDT on 15 May 2003.   Respondents should submit one hard copy and one electronic copy to Peggy Richter at Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Weapons Division, Code 210000D/P. Richter, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA 93555-6100   Electronic copy should be sent to: Peggy.Richter@navy.mil.
