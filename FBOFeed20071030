PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 06-46, Micro-Sensors for Imaging Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on Micro-Sensors for Imaging, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: www.grants.gov, DARPA website: http://www.darpa.mil/ (go to "solicitations", "MTO"), or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and four (4) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the abstract (in MS-Word readable (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM) should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-46, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-46), and it must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, November 15, 2006.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and four (4) copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal [in MS-Word readable  (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM]. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-46, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-46), and must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, January 5, 2007, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  University (prime) grant submissions may be made via the Grants.gov web site, http://www.grants.gov/, by using the "Apply for Grants" funtion. Dual submissions are not required.  Full proposals received after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-46 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Micro-Sensors for Imaging.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-46.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of either of the above listed websites/links for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided (i.e., Frequently Asked Questions).

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (5) realism of the proposed schedule; and (6) cost reasonableness and realism.

<DESC>Today's biological and chemical sensing networks work effectively to cover limited and specific physical areas and environments with significant cost and overhead.  In order to greatly expand coverage and realize greater WMD protection for the nation, a revolutionary breakthrough that provides for a much larger and lower cost sensing distributed network is required.  Through this BAA, HSARPA is seeking to accelerate advances in miniaturized biological and chemical sensing (e.g. laboratories on a chip) with integration into common device(s) and a communication systems concept for large scale multi-sensor networks. This proof of concept should be capable of detecting hazardous biological and/or chemical materials with eventual expansion to the detection of explosive and eventually radiological materials (in future collaborations with other organizations). In the first year, proposed work should lead to a minimum of a relevant laboratory demonstration of a proof of concept sensor, device and communications system for Cell-All. Optional second year work may be proposed to build upon success in year one and may include additional field experiments and characterizations.

<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is issued for the procurement of a highly qualified construction contractor to perform all the services related to the Faade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY.  The selected construction contractor will be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as will be required by the resultant contract. 

The Estimated Construction Cost Ranges from $45,000,000 to $55,000,000.

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark. The 575,000 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry bearing walls, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding secured directly to masonry walls with ferrous anchors, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interiors Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Historic Building Preservation Plan (HBPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further faade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior.

The Scope of Work will include, but may not necessarily be limited to, the following work items:

	Replacement of nearly all of the existing deteriorated terra cotta cladding with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials and new non-ferrous supports and anchorage devices on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure.
	Retention, repair, restoration, re-pointing and cleaning of existing terra cotta at window surrounds on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure wherever possible.
	Repair, restoration, cleaning, and re-pointing of the existing granite cladding on the facades of both the 1892 and 1933 structures.
	Replacement of the entire slate roofing system on both structures, including the tower on the 1892 building,  to match the appearance and character of the existing slate roof, including associated wood decking and lead coated copper gutters, gutter boxes, flashing, valleys and ridges.
	Installation of an access and fall protection/prevention system in compliance with all applicable OSHA regulations at the slate mansard roof on both structures to facilitate periodic maintenance of perimeter gutters and drains. 
	Hazardous materials investigation and abatement associated with the above work items.

The Government will solicit proposals under a source selection process for Construction Contractors.  Selection will be based on a combination of technical and price factors that provide the best value to the Government. The Government will select up to three (3) Construction Contractors to provide pre-construction services.  The Construction Contractors will provide design phase consultations evaluating costs, schedule, alternative design implications, building systems, construction materials and constructability.  At the conclusion of the Bid Phase, one (1) of the Construction Contractors will be selected to provide construction services.  The selected Construction Contractor will serve as the General Contractor during construction, contracting directly with subcontractors.  Award of this contract will be contingent upon availability of funds. 

Additional information for this procurement will be provided in a synopsis of FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The 2d Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to procure approximately twenty-four (24) maintenance technicians (CONUS and OCONUS) and approximately eighteen (18) maintenance training Instructor/Technician services to support the MV-22 program.  It is the intent of the government to procure these services from Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office, 401 Tiltrotor Dr, Amarillo, TX, on a sole source basis using a contract with a one (1) year base period and two (2) Option years beginning 1 September 2007. Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office maintains the proprietary technical data and engineering rights to provide Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) technical reach back capability for the MV-22 Program. Bell-Boeing Joint Office is the only company that has the capability and capacity to train both MV-22 Instructors and Technicians.  Bell-Boeing can train instructors at its facilities using production assets while providing assistance in resolving unforeseen system/subsystem issued directly from the OEM Engineering and manufacturing personnel.  As potential proprietary data rights issues arise, as ones associated with composite materials in the airframe, both CONUS and OCONUS, Bell-Boeing can give immediate assistance in resolving the issue expeditiously.   An official RFP will not be released on the basis that it contains proprietary technical data from the MV-22.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Naval War College, Newport RI will be issuing a solicitation for thirty-two line items of Cisco requirements on approximately 01NOVEMBER2007.The responses to the solicitation shall be due by 12NOV2007. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. NAICS 423430 size standard 100 employees. All items shall be new. No refurbished items will be acceptable. Only authorized Cisco resellers will be considered. This is a Firm Fixed Price Commercial item type contract. Justification for procuring using other than full and open competition- Brand name Justification- is included. I, as Contracting Officer hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(c).CISCO products are required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability. The NWC site is 100% Cisco switches, routers and network equipment to provide component inter-operability. NWC is currently running a Cisco proprietary VLAN protocol on the Cisco equipment, Non Cisco equipment will not inter-operate correctly with NWC's current implementation of the VLAN protocol.
Additionally, Cisco equipment meets DoD FIPS 140-2 certification requirements. All tools for management and managing equipment are specifically designed to support Cisco devices. Site personnel and system administrators are trained exclusively on Cisco equipment. Re-training of site personnel is cost prohibitive and is not justifiable. If NWC receives non Cisco equipment, devices will not function or inter-op properly with current Cisco equipment and have the potential to sit idle as they will not furnish the site with the equipment required to provide continued educational services to our Military Students. E-mail sheila.valloney@nwc.navy.mil for an electronic copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a one (1) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-01-D-0018 for husbanding services with St. Maarten in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items. The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional North and South American husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Ts!  unami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 December 2007.

This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items. The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional North and South American husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the  development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 December 2007.

<DESC>MOBILE MULTI-SENSOR TIME-SPACE-POSITION INFORMATION (TSPI) SYSTEM (MMTS)
SYNOPSIS
March 19, 2007

The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS), Instrumentation Management Office (IMO), located at 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826, in partnership with the Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has a requirement for a Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) to lead the design, development, integration, assembly, test, management, documentation and delivery of a Mobile Multi-sensor Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) System (MMTS).   System characteristics include but are not limited to the following:  The system will be mobile, self contained except for power, and include all the necessary equipment for set-up, bore-sight, calibration and operation by a two-man crew without the use of heavy equipment.  The system will autonomously track low-flying (2 meters above ground) guided and unguided projectiles with velocities up to 2000 m/s for a range of at least10 km.  The system will provide continuous TSPI data with an accuracy of at least 100 micro-radians in azimuth and elevation and an accuracy of at least 1 meter in range at rate of at least 10 Hz. in real time.  The system will be capable of withstanding harsh weather for small periods of time and the capability to be slaved to a similar system.  The system must be transportable to support testing at other ranges.    

The MMTS program is a U.S. Army major technical test instrumentation project that will provide this required capability and will be designed to support the Test and Evaluation (T&E) of Department of Defense (DOD) weapons systems under the T&E mission area.  In order to perform that mission more efficiently and cost effectively, RTTC must enhance its TSPI tracking and data collection range instrumentation to properly conduct test and evaluation of low-flying, high speed projectiles.  Currently, Doppler radar tracking systems are unable to track missiles flying below 4 degrees to the horizon because of radar multi-path effects.  Optical-based TSPI instruments cannot provide range information.  Laser systems require retro-reflector materials attached to the projectile in order to have adequate signal-to-noise ratio to provide position information.  These materials separate from the projectile at hypervelocity speeds.  

This posting provides a draft Statement of Work (SOW), draft Performance Specification, and draft Contract Data Requirement List (CDRL) requirements.  Industry feedback concerning the draft documentation is highly encouraged.   The Government does not intend to respond to feedback provided in response to this synopsis.  The Government will incorporate applicable feedback into any resulting Request for Proposal and related Technical Documentation.    PEO STRI has made a determination to pursue the Mobile Multi-sensor Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) System (MMTS) acquisition via a full and open small business set-aside competition under the authority of FAR 19.5 (Set-Aside for Small Business). This procurement is anticipated to be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis.  Any questions or feedback to this notice must be submitted by e-mail to Nancy Potts at nancy.potts@peostri.army.mil no later than April 3, 2007.  Please refer to RFP Number N61339-07-R-0036

The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for any Bid & Proposals (B&P) costs for offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.

<DESC>The objective of this contract is to obtain contractor support in assisting the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in customizing the VARSKIN 3 computer code and updating NUREG/CR-6918 to include all improvements made to the code, and further develop and expand the codes functionality and usefulness to address foreseeable users needs.  The current version of VARSKIN 3 does not accurately predict dose from radionuclides in which photons are of primary concern.  The NRC seeks to replace the current photon model in VARSKIN 3 to give the code the ability to accurately model both beta dosimetry and photon dosimetry resulting from contamination on the skin or on protective clothing covering the skin.  The contractor must ensure that these enhancements to the code will not affect in any way the beta dose model algorithm of the code. The proposed contract will be for a 24 month period of performance. <p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is in the process of preparing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) intended for release on or around 3 December 2007 for a Common Mobile Aircrew Restraint System (CMARS) and this draft RFP will be open to the industry for comment until 17 December 2007. A final RFP is anticipated for release on 11 February 2008 with proposals due into NAVAIR by 28 March 2008. To recapture some of the information provided in the previous RFI issued in March 2007 for the CMARS, the Navy is looking for either developmental or commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that can provide improvements to Mobile Aircrew Restraint Systems for Crash & Fall protection. Candidate platforms include both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft that include mobile crewmembers. Systems are desired that have application to large cabin aircraft to provide continuous restraint while preventing mobile occupants from being ejected during a crash or from falling through large openings, doors, ramps, etc. While COTS equipment is of particular interest, all candidate technologies that may meet Mobile Aircrew Restraint requirements are sought. This is not a request for information or a request for proposal, rather a synopsis to aid in the preparation of submissions for the anticipated draft and final RFPs. All inquires must be sent to  David Borne, Code AIR-2.4.2.2.3, Naval Air Systems Command, Building 2272, Room 353, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent river, MD 20671-1547.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:  DO NOT CONTACT OR SEND ANY QUESTIONS OR RESPONSES TO POSTING AGENT D. V. ROSEBOROUGH.  ANY QUESTIONS AND ALL RESPONSES MUST BE SENT BY EMAIL TO CAROLYN DAVID, cdavid@sandia.gov.  PHONE INQUIRIES CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED.

PURPOSE:  Sandia National Laboratories in conjunction with the US DOE Solar Energy Technology Program is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) for research and development for the Solar Energy Grid Integration Systems program (SEGIS).  Emphasis is on the development of advanced inverters, controllers, and other balance-of-system components for photovoltaic (PV) distributed power applications.  The goal of the program is to increase the value of PV as large numbers of interactive systems are incorporated into utility distribution systems.  A formal solicitation is anticipated by November 15, 2007.

SCOPE OF WORK SUMMARY:  The scope of the SEGIS program includes improving the reliability and increasing the value of PV inverter/controllers while developing interfaces for advanced grid integration.  Solar Energy Grid Integration Systems are needed that will increase the value of solar energy systems in todays one-way distribution infrastructure and/or will increase the value of systems in tomorrows two-way grid or micro-grid.  The heart of the SEGIS, the inverter/controller, will manage generation and dispatch of solar energy to maximize value, reliability, and safety.  The inverter/controllers will also interact with building energy management systems and/or smart loads, with energy storage, and with the utility to allow the integration of relatively large amounts of PV energy while maintaining or increasing grid reliability.  
This request supports the development of advanced integrated inverter components or packages, system controllers, balance-of-system components or packages, or fully integrated packages or systems for use in Photovoltaic (PV) systems.  The developments include distributed energy and integrated energy management systems (EMS) that include energy storage.  Grid Integrations for Photovoltaic System advances are the focus of this R&D.  Synergistic applications that are related to expanding the PV industry that offer mass production solutions and major system installation advantages will be considered.  

The emphasis of the program is on developing inverter/controller/balance-of-system that enable integration of large amounts of PV into the electric utility distribution system.
The scope of the program also includes development of inverters/controllers/balance-of-system for grid-interactive solar distributed generation systems that either:
1.	incorporate energy management functions and/or power control and/or conversion for energy storage, or
2.	include the ability to interface with energy management or energy storage system, smart appliances, or utility portals, including adaptation of these systems to communicate with and/or control the inverter/controller.
Respondents (supplier or supplier teams) must show a history of experience in areas applicable to their proposal and show the intention of working with or having direct access to a manufacturing facility that is ISO-certified.  Respondents must demonstrate a familiarity with national distributed energy systems and utility interconnection requirements.  



Respondents must document the following:

Area of interest in the list of improvements to be considered above include:
Corporate experience in the area of interest, including implementation of design concepts.
Experience of the key personnel who may be assigned to work on this effort.
Past history of working as or with a manufacturing facility that is ISO 9000 certified to the 2001 standard.
Familiarity with national PV and distributed energy standards and requirements.

The Respondents must also state the following:
1. Legal name and address, 
2. Technical contact, phone number, fax number and email address,
3. Respondent's contact name and title, phone number, fax number and email address,
4. If the entity is a small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman owned business, non profit organization, educational institution, or is located in a HUBZone. 

After a review of the responses, Sandia may issue a formal solicitation for R & D efforts on either a competitive or on a non-competitive basis. Sandia reserves the right to eliminate from consideration any entity that does not respond to this notice or does not comply with the instructions and requirements of this RFI or whose response indicates a poor likelihood of performing successfully in this effort.

Respondents wishing to protect specific information and data from unauthorized disclosure should mark such information as "Limited Rights Data," or "Restricted Computer Software," as defined in FAR 52.227-14 - Rights in Data - General.  Sandia has found that it cannot assure protection of Supplier data information if it is only marked as "Proprietary".

Respondents should submit a letter of interest that provides all information specified in response to this Request for Information to Carolyn David; cdavid@sandia.gov; at Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5130, MS0717, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0717 by November 10, 2007.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a contract for the purchase of commercially available hardware and software Assistive Technology (AT) and support services for qualified employees with disabilities.  The support services to be provided will include integration of AT with existing computer Electronic Information Technology (EIT), installation, training, hardware maintenance and software support.  The maintenance and software support will cover AT provided under this contract and specified AT currently owned by the IRS.  The required supplies and services have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  In accordance with Part 19 of the FAR, this procurement has been designated a total small business set-aside.  As such, competition will be limited exclusively to small business concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541519.  The solicitation document is available at http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement/article/0,,id=125378,00.html .  Copies of the solicitation can only be obtained from the internet address listed above.  All relevant information regarding proposal preparation and submission will be included in the solicitation document.  The solicitation number is TIRNO-07-R-00010.  No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.  
Please Note:  This solicitation will require the following brand name products:

(1)  JAWS (Job Access With Speech) Professional Edition Screen Reader Software, Manufacturer:  Freedom Scientific, (2)  ZoomText for Screen Magnification Access Software, Manufacturer:  Ai Squared, (3)  Dragon Naturally Speaking (DNS) Professional Series and Legal Edition; both for Speech Input System, Manufacturer:  Nuance Communications, (4)  Kurzweil 3000 Multi-sensory Output Software and Kurzweil 1000 Integrated Optical Character Recognition System, Manufacturer:  Kurzweil Educational Systems, (5)  Magnitalk Software, Manufacturer:  Next Generation Technologies, Inc., (6) Braille Translation Software, Manufacturer:  Duxbury Systems, Inc., (7)  Single Handed Keyboard, Manufacturer:  PCD Maltron Ltd., (8)  Portable VCO (Pocket Speak and Read Voice Carry Over VCO, Manufacturer:  Krown Manufacturing, Inc.

Extensive research and testing has been conducted and it has been concluded that the products noted above are the only products available in the market place that can fulfill the specific, unique requirements under this proposed contract for employees with disabilities.  These products have been found to be the only products that fulfill the technical specifications as well as meet the specific individual physical requirements of the people who would use them.  Further, the IRS currently owns licenses for many of the software products noted above.  The IRS also owns maintenance agreements for this software.  This software has been approved for use within IRS' common operation environment and has been proven to pose no conflicts.  Many of IRS systems have built in scripts for JAWS users, for example, so the software is usable for the employees that require JAWS to do their jobs.  A change in software would require massive recoding of IRS proprietary software to adjust to new assistive technology solutions.  The possibility that newly proposed software would not be compatible with IRS systems and the accumulated cost impact involved in the installation and training make an alternate solution cost  prohibitive.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 06-46, Micro-Sensors for Imaging Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on Micro-Sensors for Imaging, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: www.grants.gov, DARPA website: http://www.darpa.mil/ (go to "solicitations", "MTO"), or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and four (4) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the abstract (in MS-Word readable (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM) should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-46, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region is pleased to announce an opportunity for Construction Excellence for the Faade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY.  GSA is seeking a Construction/General Contractor to perform both PreConstruction and Construction Services for this project. 

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.     The 575,000 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry bearing walls, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding secured directly to masonry walls with ferrous anchors, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.

The Overall Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is $45,000,000 to $55,000,000.

The procurement process will be performed in two (2) stages. The acquisition strategy for this project will be in accordance with Source Selection Processes and Techniques (FAR Part 15.1).  This will be a competitive acquisition, utilizing the tradeoff process approach under the Best Value Continuum (FAR 15.101).  This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and technical factors and allows the government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.  For this acquisition all technical evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. 

For Stage 1, offerors must submit a technical proposal responding to the following technical evaluation factors: 1) Experience on Similar Projects, 2) Past Performance on Similar Projects and 3) Qualifications of Key Personnel. The factors will be described in the solicitation. The Source Selection Evaluation Board will evaluate the technical proposals received against the factors identified for Stage I. Based on the evaluation of each proposal, a competitive range will be established in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(1). Then, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), based on the results of the evaluation, the Contracting Officer will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offerors. For this procurement, the competition will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated offerors. 

The three most highly rated offerors found to be within the competitive range will EACH be issued a stipend in the amount of $120,000 and will proceed into Stage 2 of the procurement process. The stipend will be paid to each offeror for their total effort related to the services rendered during Stage 2. 

Those firms found to be within the competitive range will assist the GSA with the A-Es Design by performing the review and evaluation of the design and construction documents.  The offerors will be required to work with GSA in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design which is within budget. Each offeror will be required to notify GSA of all issues regarding design submissions that appear inadequate and which may have the potential to jeopardize the projects goals relating to schedule, cost, quality or scope. 

The Stage 2 submission will include a Technical and Price proposal.  The Stage 2 technical proposal will include the following technical evaluation factors: 4) Design and Constructability Review and Oral Presentations; 5) Management Plan and Oral Presentations. 

At the conclusion of the design review services, the participating offerors will propose a Firm Fixed Price for the construction services option required under this acquisition.  Award of the required construction services option will be based on the evaluation of the offerors proposed Firm Fixed Price and a comparative assessment of the offerors technical proposals against the source selection evaluation criteria identified within the solicitation. Factors 4 and 5 are equal in importance to Factors 1 and 2, which are more important than Factor 3.  All the technical evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

The offerors firm fixed price proposals for the Construction Services Option will not be assigned a numerical weight, point score or adjectival rating.  GSA will use price analysis to evaluate the price proposal, not only to determine whether it is fair and reasonable, but also to determine the offerors understanding of the work and their ability to perform the requirements stipulated within this acquisition.  Although the Government anticipates awarding the Construction Services Option without discussions, if discussions are conducted the competitive range will include all three offerors from Stage I, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  .

Stage 1 submissions (technical proposals) will be due by 1:30pm, May 16, 2007. The RFP will include all the submission requirements. This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns. Before award of the contract, the firm (if not a small business of $28,500,000 gross average sales/receipts for the past three years) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.

As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, GSA will establish subcontracting goals for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns. In support of the agencys effort, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort in achieving these goals, and will place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with the small business categories listed above. GSA anticipates hosting a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking session for this project.  The Networking session is intended to affirm GSAs recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms which are considering submitting proposals on this project.  

The contract award or GSA exercise of any option is contingent upon the availability of funds.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about April 17, 2007. GSA will be holding a PreProposal conference for the Stage 1 submissions. The date and time for this conference will be issued under a separate announcement. If you are interested in submitting a proposal for this project, please contact Frank Cashman via email at francis.cashman@gsa.gov or call (212) 264-4234.

FAQ Associated with RFQ-TX-08-00004 Posting

1) The quote is asking for a price to include toner cartridges, usually toner is purchased separately, are you asking the price to include toner?

The following procurement will be released as a set aside for 8(a) firms under NAICS 541519 with a size standard of $23 Million.

The Information Technology / Information Management (IT/IM) Department, Fleet Readiness Center East (FRC East) is responsible for managing the FRC?s IT/IM resources.  A requirement exists for the performance-based acquisition of on-site contractor support services in performing and managing IT/IM support for FRC East customers of the IT/IM Department.  The scope includes systems and applications development, maintenance and enhancement; integration of systems and applications; web development and support; database development, programming and administration; data analysis; systems administration; maintenance and support of production systems; and, general data entry required to support documentation requirements associated with tasks under this effort.

As a result of migrating much of the FRC East?s IT functions to the NMCI Contract, the FRC East IT/IM Department functions have evolved/increased due to the Legacy Transition.

Additionally, support is required to augment the Government staff in fulfilling some of the FRC East?s NMCI responsibilities, such as tracking NMCI Seats and processing Move-Add-Changes (MACs).

The FRC East is an aviation repair facility owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) and staffed by civilian employees and military personnel.  The FRC East overhauls and repairs designated airframes, engines, and components and provides field teams and manufacturing, engineering, and logistic support services.  The facility is located in Eastern North Carolina adjacent to the town of Havelock.

- OMB Circular A-130, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources
- M-03-18 OMB memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
- Implementation Guidance for the E-Government Act of 2002

OBJECTIVE

GSA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to gain a better understanding of the commercial practices that govern information security and the safeguarding of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI).

INFORMATION SOUGHT

GSA has developed a proposed catalog of commercial services that assist agencies in complying with the regulations and laws outlined above (see Background).  The following services are intended to focus on total solutions rather than individual disciplines:

Credit Monitoring Services:  Services include the full range of credit monitoring services, from basic to comprehensive. The tasks involved in credit monitoring services include but are not limited to the following:
- Monitoring of all three national credit bureau reports 
- Monitoring of a single national credit bureau report 
- Fraud alerts
- Monitoring of credit information in order to detect early signs of fraudulent activity and identity theft
- Customer care
- Identity theft insurance (as allowed by applicable State statutes)
- Fraud resolution and assistance for affected individuals  
- Credit risk assessments
- Credit freeze
- Social Security Number monitoring
- Credit card monitoring  

Independent Risk Analysis Services:  Services include a review of all PII and/or PHI compromised by a data breach for trends and unusual patterns.  The circumstances surrounding the breach are investigated to determine whether it appears to be incidental, accidental or targeted.  The breached data itself is analyzed to determine if there is any current evidence of organized misuse.  The analysis will ultimately provide a determination as to the probability that breached data may be used to harm the individuals whose data has been compromised. The tasks involved in independent risk analysis include but are not limited to the following:
- Metadata analysis 
- Pattern analysis
- Risk analysis 
- Data breach analysis and response 
- Privacy impact analysis 
- Statistical analysis
- Data structure development
- Probability analysis that breached data has been used to cause harm
- Determining the level of risk for potential misuse of sensitive information
- Certification of opinion regarding misuse of compromised data
- Investigation of circumstances surrounding breach
- Development of a risk mitigation plan

Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) Services:  Services include third party testing critical to the detection and elimination of defects, before users ever experience them.  The validation of technologies, programs, and processes for the safeguarding of PII and PHI.  The verification component tests technologies, programs, and processes to ensure they work as intended and expected in safeguarding PII and PHI.   Creation of compliance privacy policies and safeguarding guidelines and processes, planning and implementation, education on regulatory compliance, risk management, cost/benefit reviews, and the exploration of verification and authentication strategies and technologies for the safeguarding of PII and PHI.  
Accreditation and Certification Services:  Services include assessment of the effectiveness and readiness of critical of technologies, programs, and processes needed to safeguard PII and PHI, evaluation of functions and continuous monitoring that assesses a subset of the management, operational, and technical controls used to safeguard information, baseline analysis and documentation of existing infrastructure, policies, and procedures needed to safeguard PII and PHI, and analysis of vulnerabilities and the metrics to measure risks associated with safeguarding PII and PHI.  It also includes the review of current privacy policies and safeguarding guidelines, maintenance and demonstration of compliance, review of regulatory impact on administrative, technical, and physical safeguarding of PII and PHI.  

Data Breach Analysis Services:  Data breach analysis looks across multiple industries to detect patterns of misuse related to a specific data loss.  The breached file is continuously monitored over a period of weeks, months, or years.  Data breach analysis can distinguish misuse resulting from a breach from misuse due to other reasons.  It can provide the locations of potential misuse for further law enforcement action.  It can also provide a listing of consumers likely to be fraud victims.

The Contractor will be required to deposit an equivalent amount of silver into the Government's storage account based on conversion of the iridium value (performed by the Government) utilizing the American Metal Market (AMM) for Iridium (Producers prices), then converting the dollar value into troy ounces of silver (AMM bullion base, fabricated form) value.  The Contractor will then be responsible for transferring either in physical form or by electronic transfer, silver owed into the Government's Engelhard account within a specified period of time. Contractor will be paid on the net weight of the processed material based on a bid price per pound, but only after processing has been completed and metals have been deposited and accepted by the Government storage site.

It is requested that any responsible United States owned and operated potential offerors interested in being considered a source for this requirement provide their point of contact information, business size, a summary of their history of performing these functions and the capabilities they have for providing this type of recycling service, which include transportation, equipment type, and recycling process method to be utilized.

<DESC>The USITC seeks to contract a sole source with a trade and tariff information expert.  However, the USITC is seeking whether or not there are other sources that meet our requirements.  The contractor will assist the USITC in providing U.S. and foreign trade and tariff information to internal USITC customers, USTR, Congress, and other users.  Services provided would include ongoing contributions to the design, development, quality, provision, and maintenance of various databases on tariff and trade information and related analytical support as necessary.  In addition, the contractor would be tasked with passing on his/her knowledge of trade and tariff information to USITC staff to build internal capacity.

The contractor will work collaboratively with USITC staff to receive direction and to ensure work products meet customer needs.  The contractor will assist USITC staff in addressing all substantive comments from customers.

Successful completion of this contract requires a unique combination of knowledge and skills, including: 
 ?	an expert level of knowledge of U.S. and foreign trade and tariff data sources and uses, 
 ?	an expert level of understanding of the operations and procedures of U.S. government (e.g., USITC, USTR, and Congress) and international trade-policy organizations (e.g., WTO) as well as a detailed knowledge of their needs with respect to U.S. and foreign trade and tariff information, and
?	an expert level understanding of the capabilities and limitations of software and automation to evaluate and make recommendations on activities in the development and use of techniques for retrieving and analyzing trade and tariff information. 

TASKS
Tasks envisioned within this scope of work could include contributing to the maintenance of certain aspects of the USITC?s Dataweb, providing various trade and tariff information deliverables to both internal (e.g. for USITC section 332 and 131 investigations) and external (e.g., USTR and Congress) customers, and the verification of trade and tariff information submissions by foreign governments to the World Trade Organization.  Many of these tasks must be completed quickly to meet customer requirements.  Each task will be designed to result in a specific deliverable.  Each task will also require the contractor to transfer knowledge to USITC staff on how to successfully accomplish the work in order to build internal capacity.  Examples of individual tasks are provided below. 

The preparation of trade and tariff transposition data for the USTR to submit to the WTO secretariat, and responding to technical questions from the USTR, WTO secretariat, and WTO members in regards to these data. These duties require expert knowledge of U.S. trade and tariffs, including the methods and procedures of updating the USITC's trade and tariff databases; nomenclature concordances; and WTO guidelines and procedures. This expertise is required because high quality data is essential for the negotiating process. The USTR relies on the USITC to provide these data.

The preparation of data files that show the revisions to U.S. tariff rates that result from the implementation of trade agreements.  These agreements typically involve staged reductions of current U.S. tariffs.  The task requires interpreting complex trade agreements and their relationship to tariff rates.  It also requires a thorough understanding of U.S. tariff schedules and appropriate software (including USITC-developed applications) to calculate and present the new tariff rates. Customs and Border Protection relies on the USITC to provide these files.

Acting as a consultant for the USITC's HTS modernization project.  This project is designed to improve the efficiency of creating revised editions of the HTS by using sophisticated computer programs.  This task requires an expert knowledge of the HTS structure and a detailed knowledge of how to apply appropriate computer software, including USITC-developed applications. A major part of this task is quality control. The HTS provides essential information to the trade community and errors must be minimized.  All responses must discuss in detail the contractor experience with the above requirements.  All experience must have been experience gained within the last three year. All information provided shall be typed in Word format in 20 pages or less.  All responses to this RFI are on a voluntary basis.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information to this announcement or any follow-up information request.  All documents provided to the USITC will become the property of the USITC.  All comments should be addressed to Maya Lay, in writing at (email: Maya.Lay @USITC.Gov, or by faxed at 202-205-2337.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION The United States Army Medical Command (US Army MEDCOM) is seeking sources for the recruitment of critical healthcare professionals as General Service (GS) or National Security Personnel System (NSPS) positions.   BACKGROUND The US Army MEDCOM mission is to project and sustain a healthy and medically protected force during war, international conflict or natural disasters; deploy a trained and equipped medical force; and manage the healthcare of the Soldier and military Family.   This includes: 	a.  Executing applicable Army Title 10 responsibilities on behalf of the Secretary of the Army by exercising specified administrative control (ADCON) of organic, assigned and attached Army forces. 	b.  Operating the Armys fixed medical centers, community hospitals, health centers and medical/dental clinics; conducting medical research; developing medical concepts, doctrine, and systems to support Army wide health services; supporting health promoti on and preventive medicine; and providing institutional veterinary services for the Department of Defense.   	c.

Developing informational and marketing materials for distribution to target applicant pools in schools or job fairs;      c.  Conducting outreach efforts in schools, colleges and universities;      d.  Submitting resumes  to a central office to be designated by MEDCOM; e.  Advertising of vacancy announcements through various media; The US Army MEDCOM is open to alternative ideas.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help MEDCOM better define its requirements and obtain a contract management solution that meets its needs. DISCLAIMER This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Although offeror is used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned .

<DESC>Project Manager, Logistics Information Systems (PM LIS) Request for Information, Government Objectives and Requirements Logistics Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)  Data Transfer - Enhancements (LSDT-E) The Program Manager, Logistics Information Systems (PM, LIS) requests information on technical options to achieve the Governments objectives, identify vendors with capabilities and experience related to PM LIS data transfer enhancement objectives and requ irement.  The Government will use information received from vendors to conduct effective market research and analysis of technical and acquisition alternatives.  Information received will be treated as proprietary.  The information received and results of the analysis will assist the Government in releasing a Request for Proposal with a clear Statement of Objectives.  Responses should include estimates of skill mix and level of effort required to accomplish the transformation, recommended technical approach , as well as address any perceived risks . The Governments objective is to pursue more efficient data packaging techniques to reduce file sizes and transmission times of tactical logistics management systems managed by PM LIS and compatible external systems over the existing communications infrast ructure approved for use by military forces in garrison and when deployed.   1.	Needs Summary:   1.1.	Operational Observations:  Requirements for operational, functional, and weapon system platform logistics data transmission have increased in response to the imperative for operational visibility and timely decision making.  Correspondingly, the size and number of logistics data transmissions have increased, representing a significant portion of the military data that must be passed over the limited available broadband communications infrastructure.  Some logistics reference files and fleet status repo rts take as much as 3 hours to transfer between operational nodes inhibiting effective logistics operations.  The associated strain on bandwidth capacity has contributed to increased communications infrastructure requirements and costs.  1.2.	Operational Need:  The Army G4 and Army CIO/G6 directed Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) to pursue more efficient data packaging techniques to reduce file sizes and transmission times of tactical logistics management s ystems that operate in stand-alone peer-to-peer system architectures and/or use the Combat Service Support (CSS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) network.  The intent is to improve the effectiveness of logistics operations at the point of service managed by PM LIS tactical logistics systems, reduce logistics data transmission demands on CSS SATCOM services, and  allow the Army to reduce costs associated with communications bandwidth services.  2.	Description of Functional Requirements and Restrictions 2.1.	The Government is seeking to integrate a data transfer enhancement capability to existing Logistics STAMIS systems in order to reduce the amount of time required to transmit data between STAMIS nodes, as well as, with STAMIS support centers and proper ly equipped external trading partner systems.  Systems that PM LIS is currently considering for the integration of data transfer enhancement are: "	Unit Level Logistics System Aviation (Enhanced) [ULLS-A(E)] "	Standard Army Maintenance System Enhanced (SAMS-E)  "	Standard Army Ammunition System (SAAS) "	Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) "	Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE) 2.2.	The following summary of functional and technical characteristics and restriction are provided to describe the minimum capabilities that are likely to meet the objective functional requirements "	The data transfer enhancement shall reduce the size of files presented for electronic data transfer by at least 60% except in cases where file size reduction offers nominal benefit in terms of reduced transmission time. "	The data transfer enhancement shall recognize data presented for transmission and optimally compress record-oriented data. "	The data transfer enhancement shall be a software-based solution "	The data transfer enhancement shall require minimal modification to the baseline software to which the enhancement capability is integrated. "	The data transfer enhancement shall conform to all Department of the Army Enterprise networking policies. "	The data transfer enhancement shall conform to all Army information assurance and security policies (See references below). "	The data transfer enhancement shall provide firewall compliant communication methods. "	The data transfer enhancement shall provide auditing capability. "	The data transfer enhancement shall provide a means for an application to validate and report completion of communications. "	The data transfer enhancement shall be scalable. "	The data transfer enhancement shall provide a distributed capability to support platform updates regardless of temporary unit deployment "	The data transfer enhancement shall require minimal user intervention for installing.  "	The data transfer enhancement shall be transparent to the system user and require minimal training in order activate/deactivate the feature.  No additional deployable unit personnel will be required to maintain the capability. "	Data transfer enhancement features training required by Combat Service Support Automation Management Office (CSSAMO) personnel to provide region help desk support will be limited to web-based instructions. 3.	Preferred Capabilities "	The preferred data transfer enhancement shall require no modification to the baseline software to which the enhancement capability is integrated. "	The preferred data transfer enhancement shall not incorporate program-proprietary compression algorithms for the representation of data to be transmitted over network links. "	The preferred data transfer enhancement shall provide the ability to specify the minimum required Quality of Service (transmission priority, maximum latency of transmission, desired bandwidth consumption) of each registered data stream before beginning t ransmission.   "	The preferred data transfer enhancement shall enhance the capability of a network to provide better service to selected network traffic over various technologies, including Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Ethernet and 802.1 networks, SONET , and IP-routed networks that may use any or all of these underlying technologies. 4.

<SUBJECT>A -- Treatment of Cardiovascular Disorder Using the Cell Differentiation Signaling Protein NELL1
<DESC>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), managed and operated by UT-Battelle, LLC, is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize the technology.  ORNL would like to identify industrial partners interested in licensing this technology for commercial uses.  

*******Technology:  Research conducted at ORNL by Dr. Cymbeline T. Culiat focuses on therapeutic applications based on a novel signaling pathway mediated by the NELL1 protein.  Nell1 is a gene that codes for a cell-signaling protein that is critical for the formation and maturation of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems.  Nell1 triggers cell differentiation and growth via production of important factors (primarily extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and cell communication proteins) that are needed for the development of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells).  About 70% of the genes in the nell1 pathway are critical in proper formation and function of the heart and blood vessels.  Alterations in these genes (including nell1) cause a variety of cardiovascular defects in humans and/or mice.  


*******Stage of Development:  Modeled Concept- studies have been concluded in mouse models.


*******Potential Commercial Applications:  Treatments for cardiovascular disorders based on the NELL1 protein or NELL1-secreting cells for the repair and regeneration of damaged cardiac muscle and blood vessels.  Direct delivery of the protein or cells to the site of treatment can occur via biological matrices, direct injection, catheter, and other delivery methods common to clinical treatments.  Cardiovascular therapy with NELL1 can be utilized primarily for patients with damaged heart tissue resulting from heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular disorders.  


*******Patent Status:  Patent application filed.


*******Commercial Opportunity:  Please contact ORNL with commercial interests in the licensing of the UT-Battelle LLC intellectual property, and in associated research and development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle LLC and the licensee and funded by the licensee.  Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the commercialization efforts are invited to respond to this announcement.  Please provide this written statement of licensing interest (including a company description and capabilities that support commercialization of this technology) within 30 days of the original posting date of this announcement.  Please, no licensing intermediaries.  This is not a procurement activity.

<SUBJECT>V -- USTRANSCOM Theater Express Cargo Market Survey
<DESC>The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources for intra-theater delivery of air cargo from/to aerial ports throughout the CENTCOM AOR.  There is no solicitation package at this time.  This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information and allows interested industry and other parties the opportunity to provide comments for the development of the potential solicitation.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government will not make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties will be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and will be used to develop the requirement.

USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources that can provide time definite delivery (24 hrs/48 hrs/72 hrs) of air cargo to/from aerial ports throughout the CENTCOM AOR.  The contractor at a minimum will establish a presence at major aerial ports generating cargo.  The major ports generating cargo are Kuwait International (OKBK), Balad (ORBD), Al Taqaddum (ORAT), Al Asad (ORAA), and Baghdad (ORBI).  As part of that presence, an English-speaking contractor representative capable of obtaining a SECRET security clearance will be available at each location to aid in the identification, processing, and delivery of cargo to include documentation in government tracking systems and manifest cargo against those missions.  The projected workload is estimated at 275 to 350 Pallet Position Equivalents (PPE) per day; however, the contractor should be prepared to handle surge operations 500 PPE per day.

Other pertinent points:
1.	Contractor's Base Operations location is at their discretion.
2.	Contractor has the option to implement multi-modal delivery methods.
3.	Contractor must be capable of loading/offloading 463L pallets.
4.	Contractor shall supply its own MHE and manpower to operate the MHE.
5.	Contractor shall ensure all prime and subcontractors maintain FAA and CAA certifications that ensure the safety and security of DOD passengers and cargo.  Future requirements may require cargo escorts.
6.	Contractor shall develop a tiered pricing structure to support the time-definitive delivery of cargo within 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours.

 
USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment on this requirement to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (to include potential prime contractors, subcontractors, or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following:  

1.	Specific details outlining your company's ability to meet the requirements listed above.
2.	Provide a cost-per-lb estimate to perform 24-hr time definite commercial door-to-door service from/to these five major locations:  Kuwait International (OKBK), Balad (ORBD), Al Taqaddum (ORAT),  Al Asad (ORAA), and Baghdad (ORBI).  The attached spreadsheet provides the historical cargo volume generated from/to these five locations for the period Jan thru July 2007.  Special Note:  The MS-Excel spreadsheet will be provided as a separate document to this notice.              
3.	Provide a tiered cost-per-lb estimate to perform 48-hr and 72-hr time definite military assisted port-to-port service from/to these locations:  Djibouti (HDAM), Farah (OAFR), Faizabad (OAFZ), Heart (OAHR), Bagram (OAIX), Jalabad (OAJL), Kabul (OAKB), Kandahar (OAKN), Maimana (OAMN), Mazar I Sharif (OAMS), Shindad (OASD), Sherberghan (OASG), Salerno (OASL), Tarin Kowt (OATN), Kunduz (OAUZ), Sharana (OAZ3), Bahrain International (OBBI), Al Dhafra (OMAM), Seeb (OOMS), Thumrait (OOTH), Jacobabad (OPJA), Islamabad (OPRN), Mosul (ORBM), Erbil (ORER), Kirkuk (ORKK), Basrah (ORMM), Qayyarah West (ORQW), Al Sahra (ORSH), Tall Afar (ORTF), Talil (ORTL), Al Kut (ORUB), Al Taji (ORT4), Al Udeid (OTBH), and Manas (UAFM).  Other additional CENTCOM AOR locations will be negotiated on a case by case basis.

<OFFADD>National Labor Relations Board, Division of Administration, Procurement and Facilities Branch, 1099 14th Street, N.W., Washington, DC, 20570, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>76 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO Dun and Bradstreet
<DESC>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with D&B Corporation (D&B), 103 JFK Parkway, Short Hills, N.J. 07078, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.           

 The NLRB relies on D&B's Business Information Reports (BIR) to provide attorneys and compliance officers with comprehensive and detailed business information on companies. As an information tool, the BIR helps the Regional offices determine whether cases brought before the Board have sufficient merit, which determines whether it continues in the casehandling process. The BIR is critical to casehandling matters because it gives a D&B rating D-U-N-S number, in depth financials, bankruptcies, lawsuits, liens, payment histories, industry trends, corporate structure, company history, number of employees, UCC filings, and the location and description of the facilities. Moreover, D&B provides access to Dun and Bradstreet databases and services that provide comprehensive business information and related services. The NLRB relies on D&B's process for collecting and enhancing data which is called DUNSRight.  Founded on Quality Assurance, which includes over 2,000 separate automated and manual checks to maximize the integrity of the business data, DUNSRight also includes five drivers that work sequentially to aggregate, standardize and enrich the data: Global Data Collection, Entity Matching, the D-U-N-S Number, Corporate Linkage and Predictive Indicators. These drivers facilitate casehandling in a variety of ways. Global Data Collection aggregates data from hundreds of sources to provide superior breadth and depth of business information enabling the NLRB to make informed decisions. D&B has Entity Matching, a proprietary method for integrating data that allows for and corrects variations in spelling (e.g. IBM vs. International Business Machines), formats, trade styles and addresses, among other elements, and associates data from disparate sources (e.g. a state business license, a federal 10K filing, a Yellow Pages listing) with the appropriate D&B record. At the heart of the NLRB company research is the D-U-N-S? Number which is a unique, nine-digit identification code that is assigned and maintained solely by D&B.  The D-U-N-S Number is assigned to a company on a location-specific basis and remains with that specific business unit even if it closes or goes out-of-business. It is critical information when the research turns on the companies that have multiple names (d/b/a or a/k/a). Corporate Linkage helps the NLRB identify companies on a location-specific basis. The D-U-N-S Number also links members of their corporate families through Corporate Linkage. For NLRB purposes, D&B's business database features more corporate families than any other data provider with over 2.5 companies in the U.S. There is no limit to the breadth or depth of a corporate family tree. There are occasions when the NLRB uses D&B's Predictive Indicators for statistical analysis to predict future performance.  Predictive Indicators combine the analytical capabilities with unique D&B data capabilities, including industry-specific knowledge, financial and payment information on numerous private companies and extensive historical information for modeling and trend analysis purposes. This helps predict a companies potential for failure. 

Many Dun & Bradstreet databases are also available through gateways on other services, such as Dialog, Lexis and Westlaw, but the cost is prohibitive and full functionality of service and information is limited.

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying NLRB's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which will be considered for furture requirements.       A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared per the format in Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number INL 0AAE-071907 is a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government intends to award a firm, fixed price contract for a study to evaluate the progress of the ASEAN Member Countries in achieving the goal of a Drug-Free ASEAN by 2015.
 
ASEAN Cooperation Project

Background, problem analysis and justification

Within ASEAN illicit drugs have long been an issue of concern. Through concerted, collective and conscientious efforts by Governments and various sectors, success has been achieved in a number of areas.  Illicit opium production has been significantly reduced, with most countries in the region now declared opium-free.  Despite these successes, taking further actions on illicit drugs remain a regional challenge given the evidence indicating that illicit drug production and consumption patterns are changing. The illicit manufacture of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS), particularly methamphetamine, is increasing and consumer markets expanding.  Data suggest that clandestine manufacture of ATS is moving from East Asia to parts of Southeast Asia.  Shifting abuse patterns are evident, and intravenous drug use remains relatively high in the region, reflected in the increasing HIV/AIDS infection rate.

ASEAN Foreign Ministers, at the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in July 1998, signed the Joint Declaration for a Drug-Free ASEAN by 2015 that affirmed the Association?s commitment to eradicate illicit drugs in Southeast Asia.  At the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in July 2000, Governments reiterated their concerns ?on the threat from drug abuse and drug trafficking on the security and stability of the ASEAN region? and agreed to advance the target year for realizing a drug-free ASEAN to 2015.  With less than eight years before the expiry of this target date, serious concerns remain about the achievability of the expected timeline.

Statement of Work

The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) of the U.S. Department of State (hereinafter Government) has a requirement for a study to evaluate the progress of the ASEAN Member Countries in achieving the goal of a Drug-Free ASEAN by 2015, focusing on synthetic drugs.  The Government intends to award a firm, fixed price contract for this requirement.  The requirement seeks to clearly identify through a report, the progress in reaching a drug-free status and to highlight the continuing challenges faced by the region, particularly from synthetic drugs.  While there is debate over what ?drug-free? implies, there is consensus, regardless of definition, that much remain to be done.  The Contractor will be responsible for providing a report with analyzed information which shall include an evidence-based analysis of regional data and national and regional responses.  In addition a series of recommendations shall also be formulated and included in the report. 

In order to utilize regional capacity and expertise from within the UN system, the assistance of UNODC  Regional Centre for East Asia and the Pacific will be sought and incorporated.

Because illicit drugs are a regional concern, the scope of the project will focus on how the above mentioned challenges affect ASEAN as a whole.  While national concerns are of importance, the varying levels of capacity to deal with the issues as well as the existing knowledge regarding the problem warrant a regional overview which will clearly identify gaps in responses.

The results of the project will be owned by the ASEAN Secretariat and the recommendations provided in the resulting report will contribute towards responses.  It is expected that, based on the analysis and recommendations emerging from the project, a series of actions will be put in motion to address primary concerns.

The primary deliverables/objectives:

?	A 2001 baseline information on synthetic drug usage and production in ASEAN, including ASEAN?s achievements and challenges so far in reaching the Drug-Free ASEAN 2015

?	A set of recommendation on the strategies to be taken to achieve the Drug-Free ASEAN 2015

The contractor will be responsible for the following in order to achieve the objectives of this project:

An overview of the regional situation in terms of synthetic drug manufacture, production, trafficking and abuse


Activities

1.1	Complete documentation review from all relevant sources at national, region and international levels. 

?	analyze data trends on illicit drug manufacture, production, trafficking and abuse;
?	analyze data trends on precursor chemicals, their production, importation, exportation, and diversion, particularly in light of the ASEAN Single-Window Initiative;
?	review tracking mechanisms for precursor chemicals;
?	review law enforcement activities to suppress the supply of illicit drugs, and efforts to curtail the spread of clandestine laboratories producing synthetic drugs; 
?	review implementation of alternative development for illicit crops replacement;
?	Assess sufficiency of programmes on prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and reintegration activities and services for demand reduction. 

1.2 On location assessments in counties where existing documentation is insufficient or where clear gaps in information or knowledge are evident.

Visit relevant ASEAN Member Countries to obtain data and information required for the review and consult with relevant officials to identify country achievements and challenges.

1.3 Discuss with ASEAN Secretariat the linkage between ASEAN Development Vision to Advance National Cooperation and Economic Integration (ADVANCE) and the output of this study,

	Presentation of assessments and recommendations for ASEAN Member Countries

Based on the overview, the contractor shall provide an analysis on how best to address the issue of illicit drug demand and supply reductions at the ASEAN regional level.  At the ASEAN regional level, recommendations on region-wide strategies shall be recommended, be it through establishing regional frameworks on law enforcement, new strategies in civic awareness, new areas for research and development, innovative crop substitution strategies or any other strategies deemed appropriate.

Setting-up of country benchmarks based on progress in combating illicit drug usage and production so far will be used as a basis for future assessment. 

Based on current progress in Member Countries, a series of recommendations will be developed for individual national responses in achieving a drug-free ASEAN by 2015.

Activities

2.1	Present results of assessment and policy recommendations at the ASOD and ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Trans-National Crime (AMMTC) to be held in 2007; 

2.2	Organize and facilitate a workshop for all drug control agencies to discuss, and devise responses to the recommendation of the report and identify implementation and monitoring modalities via the regional frameworks of ASOD and ACCORD. 

The following list is an initial list of documents to be reviewed. This list is not conclusive and it is likely other documentation will be included in the review.

?	National Drug Reports (as produced and printed by the relevant drug agencies) 
?	UNODC East Asia and the Pacific Regional Profile 2006 
?	UNODC Country Profiles for Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Indonesia and Myanmar 
?	Patterns and Trends of ATS and Other Drugs of Abuse in East Asia the Pacific 2003, 2004, 2005 
?	Towards A Drug-Free ASEAN and China: Assessing ACCORD Progress 2000-2005
?	ACCORD Annual Report 2004, 2005, 2006 
?	UNAIDS Annual Report 2006 
?	ASOD Meeting Reports 

Meeting, consultations on-site visits:

It is expected that a number of visits to selected countries will take place over the first part of the project. In addition, a number of meetings and consultation must also take place in order to include current information into the final report.

BACKGROUND The NCI Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG?) program has established standards for interoperability between information systems in all areas of biomedical research.  Many cancer research sites have implemented or are in the process of implementing caBIG-compatible systems.   However, there remains widespread unmet need for a robust, commercially-supported electronic Data Capture and Management system for clinical and related human-subjects research data. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) invests several hundred million dollars annually to sponsor and conduct clinical trials in the areas of cancer therapy, prevention, diagnosis, and epidemiology.  Studies are conducted both at the NCI and at NCI-funded organizations nationwide.  These organizations include the NCI-designated Cancer Centers; the NCI Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups; the Specialized Programs for Research Excellence (SPOREs) along with several smaller trial consortia. The major NCI Centers and Divisions sponsoring clinical trials include:  NCI Center for Cancer Research (CCR, Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), and Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD).  These research activities, the institutions where these activities are performed, and the personnel conducting these activities, are collectively referred to as the NCI Clinical Research Enterprise.   The Statement of Work (SOW) defines the NCI requirements for a commercial off the shelf (COTS) clinical research Data Capture and Management System software product for the NCI Clinical Research Enterprise. Regular software upgrades and technical support are also required.  On site installation support by skilled staff will also be needed.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations and Conference Space, located in the Baltimore, MD area.    Request for Proposal VA-777-08-RP-0024 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.   This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.  (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)   This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through  FAR Fac 2005-19, Effective 17 Sept 2007 and VAAR 97-10. NAICS Code 721110 and the small business size standard is $6,5 million.  This BOS announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued.   The Period of Performance for this requirement will be ONE of the following weeks in April of 2008 (April 1-3 OR April 8-10, 2008).  An estimated 270 sleeping rooms and the required meeting space MUST be housed in the same facility.  The Department of Veteran Affairs, Employee Education System (EES) is sponsoring a training conference on the topic of "TCF Intern Conference."  The hotel shall accommodate 270 sleeping rooms checking in Monday, checking out Thursday; and shall provide all requirements specified for conference needs in Parts A, B and C below, and lodging rates MUST be within the Government Per Diem rate or lower for the area.

The equipment must be simple to use and operate, easy and inexpensive to maintain; it must be commercially available , have all appropriate federal certifications.  The proposed equipment must include a warranty, technical support, installation support and setup, and training.  We are anticipating awarding a requirements type contract for Cell phone and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Data Extraction Hardware Forensic Utilities.   The Government is interested in forensic related hardware to extract cell phone and PDA data.  The system must be rugged, light weight, field portable, battery powered, and capable of extractin g data from the most current and popular cell phones and PDAs.  The system must quickly extract digital data from cell phones and PDAs in a manner that protects the original evidence being sought and in a manner that is consistent with standard forensics p ractice. The proposed forensics kit must be all inclusive and operational out of the box. The estimated number of units is 100 per year.  However, actual unit s ordered will be determined by budget constraints and approved request for the equipment under the CEDAP program.  The evaluations will be accomplished in two parts:  Part 1 is a go/no go proposal evaluation phase and Part 2 is the technology proposal/dem onstration phase.  Those vendors who pass part 1 evaluation phase will be invited to demonstrate in Part 2.  Proposals not selected for Part 2 demonstrations are considered rejected and will not receive further consideration.  Part 2 demonstrations will be  at a place and time to be determined by the government.  Currently, it is anticipated the demonstrations will be during the week of December 9 through December 15, 2007, in Orlando, Florida.   However, the dates and location are subject to change.  The ve ndors selected for Part 2, technology proposal/demonstration, will be notified by December 5, 2007 of the location, date, and time.  As there may be several vendors selected for demonstration, the scheduled dates and times will not be adjusted to meet indi vidual proposers requirements. Vendors invited to demonstrate in Part 2 will be allowed to demonstrate their product, within a limited time constraint and in front of a panel of subject matter experts (SME).  Vendors will have 15 minutes for set-up, 30 mi nutes for product demonstration, and 10 minutes for take down; these time limits will be strictly enforced.  The demonstrations will be video taped.

The evaluations will be accomplished in two parts:  Part 1 is a go/no go proposal evaluation phase and Part 2 is the technology proposal/demonstration phase.  Those vendors who pass part 1 evaluation phase will be invited to demonstrate in Part 2.  Proposals not selected for Part 2 demonstrations are considered rejected and will not receive further consideration.  Part 2 demonstrations will be at a place and time to be determined  by the government.  Currently, it is anticipated the demonstrations will be during the week of December 9 through December 15, 2007, in Orlando, Florida.   However, the dates and location are subject to change.  The vendors selected for Part 2, technology  proposal/demonstration, will be notified by December 5, 2007 of the location, date, and time.  As there may be several vendors selected for demonstration, the scheduled dates and times will not be adjusted to meet individual proposers requirements.  	Ven dors invited to demonstrate in Part 2 will be allowed to demonstrate their product, within a limited time constraint and in front of a panel of subject matter experts (SME).  Vendors will have 15 minutes for set-up, 30 minutes for product demonstration, an d 10 minutes for take down; these time limits will be strictly enforced.  The demonstrations will be video taped.
