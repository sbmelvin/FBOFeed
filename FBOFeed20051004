I.	OBJECTIVE

	The objective of this contract is to retain legal boundary surveying service for 	acquisitions of wetland and/or grassland easements areas including the route of ingress and egress on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), United States 	Department of Agriculture, pursuant to Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3837.

II.	BACKGROUND

	The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Emergency Watershed Protection Program/Floodplain (EWP/FP), the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), and the 	Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP) authorizes the acquisition of easement rights from willing landowners for the purpose of restoring and protecting wetlands, grasslands and ranchlands.  The NRCS is the lead agency 	within the United States Department of Agriculture charged with administering these programs.

III.		SCOPE

The Contractor shall provide legal boundary surveys of the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement area including the route of ingress and egress according to the following guidelines. 

Before fieldwork begins, a pre-survey site visit will occur.  Attending will be the surveyor, the NRCS District Conservationist (or other NRCS official) and the landowner (representative).  The surveyor will contact the local NRCS District Conservationist prior to the pre-survey site visit.  During the pre-survey site visit, the proposed easement boundaries will be reviewed as will the easement access route (if the easement area isn’t adjacent to a public road).  

The NRCS WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP Program Manager or District Conservationist will provide the Contractor with location maps of the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement area and access route and such other descriptive information as may be available. Only the NRCS Contracting Officer may authorize a modification to 	the easement area.  Any variations in the number of acres surveyed should be reported to the Contracting Officer immediately.  The surveyor will not modify the easement area surveyed at the direction of the landowner.  Any questions regarding the easement area should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Sue Jones, at (605) 352-1213 or via fax at (605) 352-1270.

Access shall be surveyed, but no monumentation is required.  The survey will show both the easement and the ingress and egress route to a publicly dedicated right-of-way.

The Surveyor shall prepare an appropriately scaled drawing of the survey.  The survey drawing should include at a minimum, the following items:

a)	The record description of the property or the reference to the source of the record description on the property of which the easement is located on.  The survey description of the easement.
b)	North Arrow
c)	Scale
d)	Bearings, azimuth or angles, and the distances for all courses.
e)	The central angle, length of curve and radius, and the length and bearing of chord from the beginning to end of curve for each curved common boundary line or individual boundary line.
f)	Basis of bearings or azimuth.
g)	Monuments identified as set or found along with a description of the monument.
h)	Area of the surveyed easement.
i)	Observed evidence of possession or use by others in the parcel or across any perimeter lines of the property.
j)	Sufficient data to indicate the theory of location applied in formulating the opinions as to the probable location of the boundaries and corners of the property.
k)	Name, registration number, address and phone number of the Surveyor.
l)	Name of the client.
m)	Date of the survey.
n)	Certification
o)	The surveyor will also include the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP contract number in the legend of the survey plat.

Natural or manmade barriers, such as ditches, streams, creeks, or rivers are occasionally used as boundary lines in property descriptions.  In those instances, in property descriptions where boundary lines are called for as being located at or along the centerline of a ditch, stream, creek, or river, for purposes of defining the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement, the surveyor shall traverse along the top of bank of such ditch, stream, creek, or river.  In those cases where property descriptions call for boundary lines to be located at or along a lake, for the purposes of defining the WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP easement, the surveyor shall traverse along the top bank of such lake or in the absence of a top bank, the surveyor shall traverse along a mark left by wave action at the preceding high water elevation, as determined by simple observation, or at the high water mark established by the State Water Management Board to establish the easement boundary line.  In cases, where the surveyor is unable to determine the easement boundary line, the local NRCS District Conservationist will be contacted immediately to make this determination.  Questions regarding these traverses shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

In some instances, corner points for the easement survey may be submerged.  In this event, a mark left on the bank by wave action at the preceding high water, as determined by simple observation, shall be surveyed and the location for easement corners shall be mathematically offset from that line.  Witness monuments shall be located on dry ground and tied to the computed points.

Any suspected encroachment on the tract shall be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer.

Monuments and boundary marker posts signs shall be provided and installed by the surveyor at the time the survey is completed and prior to delivery of the plat of survey and legal description.  The Surveyor will need to contact the NRCS Contracting Officer to determine if a supply of marker posts is available from the NRCS stock.  If none are available, the Surveyor shall provide such marker posts.  The Surveyor will be required to pick up the signs at the local NRCS office.  Monuments and marker posts with sign shall be installed at each corner, angle point, road crossing, and approximately  every 300 feet along the easement boundary lines.  Marker posts and monuments are required at the intersection of property lines and rivers, lakes, or streams.  All monuments must be thoroughly described and specifically identified as set or found, whenever shown on maps or referred to in documents prepared by the Surveyor.  Descriptions of monuments must be sufficient in detail to readily facilitate future recovery by other surveyors and to enable positive identification.  Acceptable monument types are:

1.	Steel rebar:  ½ inch diameter or larger with properly stamped survey cap.
2.	Steel pipe:  ½ inch inside diameter or larger with properly stamped survey cap.
3.	Concrete markers:  minimum of 4 inch diameter or 4 inches square buried in the ground, with a rebar or metal pipe and properly stamped cap encased in the concrete.

Minimum length for all monuments is two feet.  All monuments will be set flush with or below the ground surface and marked with a marker post and sign.   Acceptable marker posts are:

1.	“T” shaped steel fence post 1 3/8” x 1 3/8” x 1/8” or heavier.  Minimum length shall be seventy-eight inches.  The top six inches (6”) of the marker post shall be fluroscent orange.  

2.	“U” shaped metal sign post, minimum length shall be seventy-eight inches long, 1.12 lbs per foot.  The top six inches (6”) shall be fluorescent orange.

Marker posts shall be installed to project 4.5 feet above the ground surface.  The surveyor is required to attach a WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP boundary sign (3” x 4 ½”) to the top of the marker post using a galvanized nut and bolt or lag screw.  A wire attachment is not acceptable.  The WRP/EWP/GRP/FRPP sign has two 3/8 inch drilled holes.    

The surveyor will need to provide to the Contracting Officer:

1.	One mylar and one copy (36” X 24”) signed and sealed original survey plats that meet the requirements for filing in the appropriate county land records.
2.	One copy (11” x 17”) survey plat to the Contracting Officer and one copy 	(11” x 17”) of the survey plat to the local NRCS District Conservationist.
3.	A printout of the original field notes.    

The survey and descriptions shall meet all requirements of South Dakota Codified Laws and be certified by a Registered Professional Land Surveyor licensed in the State of South Dakota.  The relative position tolerance and traverse closure shall 	be twenty six hundredths of a foot (0.26) plus 200 parts per million (ppm) at the 95 percent (95%) confidence level as defined by the National Society of Professional Surveyors for Rural Surveys.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Panama City (NSWC PC), Panama City, Florida intends to award a contract to Lake Shore, Incorporated, 900 West Breitung Avenue, Kingsford, MI 49802-5316 on a sole source basis for the acquisition of two (2) each, AN/SLQ-48(V) Umbilical Cable Handling System (UCHS) Field Change Kits.  The AN/SLQ-48 system uses a remote-controlled submersible vehicle to identify underwater objects and, if they are mines, render them safe. The prime feature is the tethered TV and sonar-equipped Mine Neutralization Vehicle (MNV), which places an explosive destructive charge on bottom mines, and cuts the cables of moored mines.  Electrical power and data are transmitted via a neutrally-buoyant umbilical cable. Only Lake Shore can provide the UCHS field change kits for the following reasons.  There are two configurations of the UCHS. The original configuration contains obsolete hydraulic system components. The latest, current configuration is solely manufactu! red by and is proprietary to Lake Shore.  Lake Shore is the sole developer of the UCHS Field Change Kit to update the original configuration with new hydraulic system components and associated components that are currently available. To have any other manufacturer develop, fabricate and qualify another design for this kit would result in a duplication of costs and increase future support costs by adding yet another configuration to the inventory.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR VARIOUS MULTI-DISCIPLINE PROJECTS PRIMARILY IN THE STATE OF MAINE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT IS A STANDARD FORM 330.

Engineering and design services are required under an indefinite quantity contract N62472-05-R-6514, for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the state of ME.  

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $100,000 - $5M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to this contract may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 – 35%, 35 – 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the “Success” estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.

In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (Architect-Engineer) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.

The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach/Key Personnel/MACC Project Management/Bonding Capacity; and Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows: 7% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 7% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3.1% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; - and 25% Other Small Business.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRLs knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of warfighting techniques, equipment and capabilities.  Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches, as well as applied research capabilities, will be sought.  The scope of this effort primarily concerns the area of the Modeling and Simulation science, as applied to C4ISR, to investigate techniques and develop models and simulation scenarios that support experimentation in, but not limited to, improved real-time decision-making, dynamic situation assessment, dynamic prediction, predictive assessments, operationally focused/embedded simulation, theoretical foundations of decision science, and course of action analyses. AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of the Air Force and the national modeling community (Air Force Battle Labs, National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS), Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO), Air Force Warfighting Integration (AF/XI), Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), etc.).  Some areas of interest are:  model abstraction techniques, multiresolution M&S, modeling the cognitive process, synthetic environments, parallel and distributed simulation systems, interactive simulation technologies, real-time applications, augmented reality, component based simulation, optimization approaches, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, control theoretic approaches, scenario generation, M&S for wargaming and exercise support, modeling paradigms/methodologies, behavior representation, model interoperability, among others, and involve feasibility studies, functional prototyping, proof-of-concept development/demonstration and specific C4ISR/military applications.  Emphasis is placed on the insertion of technology into ongoing and planned simulation infrastructures and activities.

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>Because the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis does not produce private sector GDP for firm size categories, the Office of Advocacy over the years has contracted with researchers to calculate small businesses’ current share of private sector GDP.  For a compendium of such research, please see http://www.sba.gov/advo/research.   The Office of Advocacy is interested in updating the figures and seeing if the relative share of small business output in the U.S. economy has changed.  Note that figures should use Advocacy’s research definition of a small business, which is a firm (or the entirety of all establishments or business locations in the U.S.) with fewer then 500 employees, and the final result should include single person operations (or nonemployer businesses). Previous research has created annual estimates over time by industry.  Proposals are expected to create estimates for at least the last ten years, with older data also adding to the value of the final product. Questions and answers for this procurement shall comence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Retaining qualified employees continues to be challenging for small businesses. The sixth edition of the Small Business Problems and Priorities published by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) identified employee turnover as one of the problems that small businesses continue to encounter (http://www.nfib.com/object/IO_16191.html). The NFIB study found that keeping skilled employees is of more importance to small businesses in the construction and retail trade industries.  In a previous study funded by the Office of Advocacy, half of all small firms with one to one hundred employees were seeking employees, two-thirds reported trouble hiring (see Labor Shortages, Needs and Related Issues in Small and Large Businesses by Joel Popkin and Company (Part A http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs195atot.pdf, Part B http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs195btot.pdf). The study also found that half of the companies looking to hire someone eventually hired someone less qualified than they were looking for.Advocacy is seeking research to understand the impact of employee compensation on small businesses and how small firms can lower the employee turnover rate. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The most recent Small Business Economic Trends published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) continues to list the cost and availability of insurance as the single most important problem for small business.  Although is it below its high from a year ago, nearly twice as many respondents choose it as their top problem compared to the second biggest issue, taxes.  Health insurance as a problem has surfaced within the last two years as three years ago the cost and availability of health insurance was not even in the top three problems of the NFIB survey.This concern is testimony of how pricing and availability of health care plans are impacting small businesses offering of health insurance.  Over the last two years, employees of small firms (fewer then 500 employees) experienced a drop in employer health insurance offerings, from 44 percent to 43 percent (special tabulations using the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, March Supplement).  (Note that large firm employees had a similar decline from 68 percent to 67 percent.)  Similar findings can be found in the annual Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual survey on health employer benefits.  This widely quoted source also shows that employer-sponsored health insurance premiums rose 11.2 percent between 2003 and 2004 – the fourth consecutive year of double-digit gains.
The Office of Advocacy seeks research to study the small business health insurance issue.  Proposals should use datasources that focus on the firm size or the entirety of the business, not establishment size (or business location) data. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>There has been extensive research on factors contributing to economic growth among states in the U.S. The contributions of entrepreneurship to this economic development have received increasing attention by development officials in the states.  However, no research has been conducted to define and quantify the relationship between the dynamics of entrepreneurship and economic growth. The Office of Advocacy, in cooperation with Bureau of Census, has developed several important measures of small business activity (e.g., the number of businesses and establishments, their employment, the number of births and deaths of businesses and establishments, and their employment changes).  The Office of Advocacy seeks research proposals to utilize this data to conduct a detailed investigation of the interactions between small business activity variables and those economic and policy variables used in state and regional economic growth models to establish a better understanding of the role entrepreneurship plays in regional economic development in the U.S.  Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Office of Advocacy underwrites and supports database development, production of special tabulations, and research using large databases, in order to improve understanding of small business formation, growth, and survival and major policy issues affecting the survival and growth of small firms. To this end the Office of Advocacy seeks projects that use comprehensive existing databases to add to the state of knowledge about the state of small firms as well as major issues facing by small firms.  In addition, research proposals will also be considered that incorporate non-survey methods of obtaining or enhancing public or proprietary data.  One example would be formulating and obtaining special tabulations from existing large databases. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.

<SUBJECT>R -- ESTIMATING THE FLOW OF INVESTMENT BY ANGEL OR INFORMAL INVESTORS A STUDY OF METHODOLOGY
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-05-Q-0019
<RESPDATE>062405
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The Office of Advocacy seeks proposals on how best to produce data on angel investment. The following background information serves as the motivation for soliciting proposals on this topic.
1.Informal capital has been important in financing the growth of innovative startups in the U.S. It has become even more important during the past several years after the collapse of the IPO and the venture capital markets. During 2001 through 2003, speculation was that informal investors provided the only seed capital that was needed so much during that period.  
2.Statistical information about angels is limited. Information on angel investment, especially investment by angel capital networks, is becoming increasingly available as a result of efforts by the Kauffman Foundation.  Moreover, recent efforts to provide estimates of angel investment have accomplished much. However, two major studies, one by Jeffrey Sohl of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire  and another by William Bygrave of Babson College in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s 2003 Global Report on Venture Capital provided substantially different estimates (e.g., around $100 billion for one estimate versus $15 to $20 billion in the other estimate). 3.Since angel investing is engaged by the general population, it would be more economical to identify informal investors for survey purposes through special statistical approaches.  For instance, it would be very costly to adopt the method used in an earlier Advocacy project on informal investors during the early 1980s and the approach used by the GEM program.  It is a challenge to identify informal investors for statistical surveys of their investment activity.Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>In the last fifteen years, the share of output in the manufacturing sector has declined from 27.7 percent to 19.8 percent (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis).  Also in the last decade and a half, the static large firm (more than 500 employees) employment in manufacturing has dropped much more rapidly than small firm employment, declines of 3.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively.  The number of manufacturing firms had similar declines with large firm counts dropping by 11.7 percent and small firm counts dropping by 7.5 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Business).The Office of Advocacy seeks research to study changes in manufacturing in the last few decades as they impact the small business sector.  Possible research directions include but are not limited to focusing on the changing economies of scale in manufacturing (specialized mini-mills vs. big plants), researching a shift in shares of sub-industries in manufacturing and studying large firms’ outsourcing plants overseas. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>In the past few years, there has been rapid firm merger and acquisition activity in the United States, and little has been done to capture and understand the effects of this activity on small and large businesses.  Therefore, an update and further examination is needed to the Mergers and Acquisition in the United States,  1990-1994, originally completed by Alicia Robb and Catherine Armington in October  1998 (see: ://www.sba.gov/advo/stats/m_a.pdf ). The effects of such activity on businesses differed depending on the size of the firm; for example, small firms involved in acquisition activity generated much more employment than those in large firms, according the earlier analysis. The Office of Advocacy is interested in understanding the rate at which small businesses acquire other firms or are being acquired by larger firms.  It is also interested in the level of job creation and/or destruction. Industries prone to mergers and acquisitions should be identified. It would be worthwhile to examine the differences in acquisition or merger rates across states or regions, and how these differences correlate with state economic growth rates. To conduct this research the researcher would need to identify database(s) and methods appropriate for the analysis. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:

The SBA requires contractors to develop and support initiatives proposed by American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians and non-profit organizations for economic development projects on disadvantaged and underserved Indian reservations and tribal areas that will empower Native American entrepreneurs in accordance with the attached statement of work.


Office of Native American Affairs
Native American Economic Development Projects

Statement of Work

Background

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), through its Office of Native American Affairs (ONAA), is continuing the Native American initiative begun in FY 2003 that will provide economic development services to small businesses.  SBA will work closely with American Indians, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians, tribal governments, tribal colleges, Indian organizations, and other Federal agencies, as well as the private sector, to supplement and support the Indian nations’ plan for economic stimulus.  

Scope

The SBA/ONAA will support economic development projects that represent the interests of American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians.

1.  The projects must have the ability to meet the objective of providing increased entrepreneurial development opportunities for American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians

2.  The projects must have the potential to become “best practices” for implementation by other entities around the country.

3.  Each project must specify the targets/ milestones, and deliverables to be met to ensure completion of agreed-upon targets, goals, and outcomes.

4.  The projects must include viable plans for identifying alternate funding options so that successful projects can continue without further SBA funds.

5. Examples of some of the economic development projects SBA contemplates include but are      not limited to the following:

•	Establishing cooperatives to allow American Indian, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian small business owners to obtain economies of scale, including better pricing for equipment, supplies and services (e.g., accounting, insurance, employee benefits, payroll services, etc.), more efficient inventory systems and distribution networks and shared marketing, etc.
•	Setting up peer roundtables (taking advantage of teleconferencing or other electronic tools when feasible) to share information, experiences and best practices, to problem-solve, and to provide outside expert consultation.
•	Developing and implementing strategies to increase Internet access for individuals residing on remote locations such as tribal lands and rural areas (e.g. assisting Indian tribes to establish Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies.)
•	Developing and supporting non-traditional business structures (such as home-based businesses, agribusinesses, aqua-farming, folk art, etc.) and niche markets including exporting, e-commerce, trade and tourism, etc.
•	Establishing local resource centers to provide American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians entrepreneur’s access to the most current resources available, including the necessary hardware and software to access information online.
•	Developing and implementing quality training, counseling and access to resources to specialized target groups such as Youth Entrepreneurs, Veterans, active Military and Reservist. 

6.  Deliverable products could include activities such as:

•	Business Training Programs					
•	Brochures								
•	Website Development						
•	Business counseling						


7.  The contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities to perform the tasks listed in this Statement of Work.

8.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that all personnel working on this project have adequate training to perform their assigned tasks.  Any courses or other training needed to ensure that staff skills are commensurate with the work to be performed are the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be undertaken at no direct cost to this contract.

9. A construction project is permissible if it meets all of the criteria in the RFP/statement of work, and if it falls within the total budgeted amount.


Place of Performance

Work may be performed at the contractor’s offices or on site as necessary.  Proposals must state where work will be performed.

Period of Performance

The period of performance is one year from date of award.

Government Furnished Items

The government will not furnish items outside the scope of the contract unless otherwise provided for in this Statement of Work. 



Reporting

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate with the University of Washington located in Seattle, Washington on a sole source basis to acquire the balance of genes potentially anticipated to be re-sequenced under current contract, N01-ES-15478.  The contract delineates “gene equivalents” which were intended to correlate approximately to the actual number of actual genes which would be re-sequenced.  Variance in the complexity of genes has resulted in the variance between the number of gene equivalents and number of genes themselves.   In addition, NIEHS will acquire web-based tutorials and training in support of the developed materials.  Depending upon the success of this undertaking, NIEHS may extend the training effort for an additional year.   Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government and unnecessary delays in completing the remaining genes render competition unfeasible.  See notes No. 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modifies the subject solicitation DG1330-05-RP-1070 issued on April 28, 2005, synopsized previously under DG1330-05-RP-1057.  

The modification is necessary due to a need to restructure the statement of work as written to delete any work related to distribution, locator and duplicating services. The distribution, locator and duplicating services will be solicited by the Government Printing Office (GPO) as a separate contract.  At this time, we plan to modify the present solicitation to remove the distribution, locator and duplicating services to be procured through GPO from the statement of work. A modification to the solicitation will be issued within 2-3 weeks. The present proposal due dates are hereby suspended and a new proposal due date will be established in the next modification when it is issued. All questions concerning the solicitation that have been submitted previously will be retained and addressed in the next modification to the solicitation to be issued. The Government anticipates a new contract start date of October 1, 2005.   


The modification to solicitation will be posted to the fedbizopps web site when available. NOAA wants to assure all potential offerors that this acquisition is still a competitive 8(a) procurement and the only reasons for the delay is due to the facts stated above.

<DESC>ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR VARIOUS MULTI-DISCIPLINE PROJECTS PRIMARILY IN THE STATE OF MAINE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM 330.
Engineering and design services are required for an indefinite quantity contract, N62472-05-R-6514, for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the state of ME.  

The NAICS Code is 541310 and the small business size standard classification is $4,000,000.  The proposed contract is considered for 100% small business set-aside.       

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $100,000 - $5M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to this contract may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 – 35%, 35 – 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the “Success” estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. 

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information.

<DESC>PREAMBLE

Brookhaven National Laboratory, (herein known as "Brookhaven"), operated by Brookhaven Science Associates, (BSA) LLC, under Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886, with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory, herewith solicits your resume.

1.0	BACKGROUND
Brookhaven National Laboratory is responsible for staffing a Technical Survey Team (TST). The Team provides independent, objective, focused advice to the Office of International Materials Protection and Emergency Cooperation’s Assistant Deputy Administrator (ADA) to support effective, consistent and efficient implementation of upgrades to reduce the risk of nuclear material proliferation commensurate with U.S. national security goals.

The TST consists of a core group supplemented by “adjunct” participation as appropriate.  The core group is staffed with technical experts with both domestic and international 	nuclear expertise and experience in design, implementation and operation of safeguards 	and security systems.  For example, the team’s specific technical capabilities include: vulnerability/system analyses; design, operation and maintenance of nuclear materials physical security and material control and accountability systems; measurement of radioactive materials; response/protective force training and tactics; and implementation, inspection, evaluation and management experience.  Additional technical experts, for 	example, maritime transportation, health physics, contract review specialists, etc. may supplement the TST membership for specific reviews.


2.0	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
The TST accomplishes its mission by preparing issue papers, annually reviewing project work plans, and meeting with project teams to evaluate their progress in fulfilling the mission of the Office and to what extent the Project contributes to the Material Protection Control and Accounting (MPC&A) Program objectives.   

For the project reviews, the TST prepares both an oral summary and a comprehensive report for the ADA.  The reviews may result in recommendations to help DOE/NNSA management and Project Teams improve Program effectiveness and efficiency.  TST members generally spend one week per month in Washington, D. C. conducting reviews.

TST core members are required to have long-term and diversified experience with safeguards and security for nuclear materials.  Each member brings unique qualifications and experience to the team, representing a breadth of domestic and international expertise.  In 2004 the TST members included four Ph.D. scientists and had over 120 collective years of physical security, material control.  Occasionally, the TST calls upon other respected personnel with particular technical expertise or experience that is valuable to the TST, project and DOE Task Force Program personnel, for example maritime transportation, health physics, contract review specialists, etc.  

Staff at BNL manage the day-to-day operations of the TST project and maintain records of the reviews and issue papers.  

The job requirements associated with the position of a TST member include, but are not limited to, relevant experience in each of the following areas:
•Physical protection
•Material control and accounting
•Security analysis
•Safeguards and security
•Effectiveness evaluation of high-visibility government    programs
•International safeguards and security issues
•Inspections of domestic and nuclear facilities for treaty or  regulatory compliance
•Technical reviews
•Inspection and effectiveness evaluation of safeguards and security systems
•Ability to communicate findings and the rational both to the project teams and DOE upper management
•Preferably, experience should be gained by working at DOE sites that store and process nuclear weapons-useable materials  
•It is the policy of the TST to not use a person involved in the design of projects as a reviewer for those projects.  

In addition to these attributes, the prospective candidate must be able to: 
•Act at certain times as the TST Lead
•Take a major role in the scheduling, conducting, and evaluating- of selected TST reviews
•Have excellent oral and written communication skills, as the team is required after every project review to document their findings in a formal report.  
•Demonstrate a readiness and willingness to be involved in extensive domestic and potential international travel.
•Maintain an active DOE ‘Q’ Clearance
•Not perform services for other business entities or give the appearance of a personal or consultant conflict of interest with services performed under contract.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Area Attack Systems Group, AAC/AASG, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Ellwood National Forge Company, Irvine, PA to produce up to 30 BLU-121/B warhead cases from Eglin Steel (ES-1).  This requirement can only be met by Ellwood National Forge Company because they are the only producer of ES-1 steel that consistently meets the Government’s requirements and that can machine the BLU-121/B bomb case in accordance with the applicable drawing.  The Contractor will qualify the steel material for each warhead case by conducting a suite of mechanical property tests on heat-treated specimens obtained from the case material and providing the results to the Government.  If multiple cases come from a single ingot, all cases from that ingot can be qualified from a single suite of mechanical property specimens.

The test specimens should be prepared as follows:  heat-treat a minimum of one qualification sample from each forged ingot.  These samples will be heat-treated in the same furnace that is used to heat-treat the warhead.  Two pieces of steel, each approximating the mass of a BLU-121/B warhead, should be heat-treated along with the qualification samples to simulate a typical heat-treat load.  The Contractor will test three tensile and six Charpy impact specimens from each ingot and provide the results to AAC/AASG.  

The Government reserves the right to conduct its own suite of property tests to validate samples taken.

The required properties to be obtained from the specimen tests are listed below.  The “Single Test Minimum” refers to the minimum properties for any single test specimen.  The “Average” refers to the minimum average of at least three test specimens from any single qualification sample.

Qualification Test Properties:  Single Test Minimum/Average (of at least 3) - - Ultimate Tensile Strength:  min Yu = 240 ksi/avg Yu = 244ksi;  Static Yield Strength: min Ys = 188 ksi/avg Ys = 192 ksi; % Strain to Failure: min Sf  = 12.0%/avg Sf  = 13.0%; Charpy Impact (at -40ºF): min CI = 16 ft-lbs/avg CI = 19 ft-lbs. 

The AF Contracting Officer, or her representative, will notify the contractor of any  ingot or bomb case failing to meet minimum properties and unacceptable under this contract.   

The contractor shall measure the mass and center of gravity of each warhead in both unassembled and fully-assembled states and deliver the resulting data.  Weight limits should fall within the acceptable CG limits of a MK-84.  Cases are to be delivered to the government NLT 15 July 2006.

The technical data package is undergoing revisions and is not available at this time.  The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.  The AAC Ombudsman is Col Susan Mashiko, AAC/DC(S), 101 West “D” Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL  32542, (850) 882-0662, susan.mashiko@eglin.af.mil.  The Alternate Ombudsman is Mr. Dennis Love, AAC/XP, 101 West “D” Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL  32542, (850) 882-0312, jdennis.love@eglin.af.mil.  For contractual issues, contact Grisselle Nusimow, Contracting Officer, (850) 883-3214, grisselle.nusimow@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>Update 4 October 2005 - Virtual Industry Day for draft RFP (imminent release) and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for release by 11 October 2005.  A Virtual  Industry Day is planned to be held 1330 EST to 1530 EST, 18 October 2005.   Interested firms should review the draft RFP, once posted, and submit written  questions via e-mail to the new buyer, Theresa Hay, Theresa.Hay@wpafb.af.mil.   Submittal in advance will ensure that questions can be answered in a timely  manner during the Industry Day.  Firms need to contact the Virtual Industry  Day POC, Ms. Patricia Stiles, (937) 904-7205, Margaret.Stiles@wpafb.af.mil, to  register for the event.  Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note:  New buyer Theresa Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future  correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the Description in excess  of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought announcement of 17 May has  been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the XR-SIMAF PIXS library below  as "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05".   NOTE: The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted  OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. ************************************************************************ Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant  concern for successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration  Services contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to  reflect this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address  the OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government.   The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI  clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require  offerors to submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services  that involve a high level of complex skill sets.  The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same  however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of 500 could  overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust subcontracting  plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses that could provide  support for this acquisition and artificially reduce subcontracting goals.   Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small business base for this  acquisition and facilitate stronger small business participation, the size  standard for small businesses in this acquisition has been raised to 1,000  employees.  This determination has been coordinated and approved by the ASC  Small Business and the Small Business Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed on 8  July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at the  Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was determined that  this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business (SB)Set-Aside.  The SB  strategy under consideration will require offers to provide aggressive small  business subcontracting participation in any proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the Acquisition Plan, we  will consider up to two awards for consolidated Function Areas A, B, C and E  under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best Value Source Selection decision).  Area D may be made as a stand alone award or combined with an A-B-C-E award.   Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that  will be addressed in a tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be  posted to PIXS in the next two weeks.   The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days to late Sept 2005.  Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP. Release of the formal  RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with proposals due early Jan  06. Award is contemplated late April 06.  A new attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort. ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005:  Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has been  added to the  library (scroll below).  Questions were received during one on one interview  sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update:  Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current  contractors working in SIMAF.  A request was also received for contact  information of companies participating in Industry Days.  Both have been added  to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate  posting  answers by 6 July 2005. *************************************************************   Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.

<DESC>DESC:  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The National Cancer Institute intends to procure the services of the Hershey Medical Center of the Penn State College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033.  The support services are needed for the Cancer Etiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Biology as a follow-on contract to complete current requirements associated with Contract No. N02-CB-37025.  

Background: the Cancer Etiology Branch (CEB) of NCI’s Division of Biology, has a continuing requirement for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of a number of different research compounds of interest to the carcinogenesis research community.  The compounds are to be prepared in exploratory syntheses on a small scale and then prepared in a production run to yield one to several grams of sufficiently pure material (generally 99+  percent).  Compounds are to be characterized by a meaningful combination of appropriate techniques including specific activity; melting points; ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectroscopy; and NMR or mass spectroscopy.  Major responsibilities are: (1) resynthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH derivatives by established procedures for the restocking of NCI’s Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards Repository as necessary, and (2) development of synthesis of selected chemical carcinogens, chemopreventive agents and certain of their metabolites or derivatives.  Distribution to the research community will be handled by the repository contractor all labeled and unlabeled compounds.  Labeled compounds will be subdivided and shipped to designated recipients in the research community either directly by the synthesis contractor or through the repository contractor.  The contractor shall be required to provide analytical, handling, and storage data with all shipments.  A high degree of cooperation with NCI, the repository contractor, and other synthesis program contractors is necessary.  

The Government anticipates one contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a total period of one (1) year.  The particular requirement for this contract centers around syntheses of chemical compounds from the following three categories:  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their metabolites (including 1-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, 5-hydroxybenzo[c]phenanthrene, 11-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, 6,12-dimethylchrysene, anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrobenzo[g]chrysene, anti-1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5,6-dimethylchrysene); Nitrosamines and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including NNK and its metabolites, N-Methyl-N-nitroso-N-nitroguanidine, 
N-Nitrosoguavacoline, N-Nitroso methyl benzylamine); and Chemopreventive agents (including  SAHA and PBIT).  Since the intermediates and synthetic schemes have been developed by the investigators employed with the Hershey Medical Center, they meet the requirements of the FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2), in that they are the only responsible source that will satisfy the agencies requirements without significant cost in the loss of time and materials already invested in these syntheses. The estimated period of performance is September 30, 2005 through September 29, 2006.  The NAICS Code is 54170.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  No Collect Calls accepted.

<DESC>PREAMBLE

Brookhaven National Laboratory, (herein known as "Brookhaven"), operated by Brookhaven Science Associates, (BSA) LLC, under Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886, with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory, herewith solicits your resume.

1.0	BACKGROUND
Brookhaven National Laboratory is responsible for staffing a Technical Survey Team (TST). The Team provides independent, objective, focused advice to the Office of International Materials Protection and Emergency Cooperation’s Assistant Deputy Administrator (ADA) to support effective, consistent and efficient implementation of upgrades to reduce the risk of nuclear material proliferation commensurate with U.S. national security goals.

The TST consists of a core group supplemented by “adjunct” participation as appropriate.  The core group is staffed with technical experts with both domestic and international 	nuclear expertise and experience in design, implementation and operation of safeguards 	and security systems.  For example, the team’s specific technical capabilities include: vulnerability/system analyses; design, operation and maintenance of nuclear materials physical security and material control and accountability systems; measurement of radioactive materials; response/protective force training and tactics; and implementation, inspection, evaluation and management experience.  Additional technical experts, for 	example, maritime transportation, health physics, contract review specialists, etc. may supplement the TST membership for specific reviews.


2.0	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
The TST accomplishes its mission by preparing issue papers, annually reviewing project work plans, and meeting with project teams to evaluate their progress in fulfilling the mission of the Office and to what extent the Project contributes to the Material Protection Control and Accounting (MPC&A) Program objectives.   

For the project reviews, the TST prepares both an oral summary and a comprehensive report for the ADA.  The reviews may result in recommendations to help DOE/NNSA management and Project Teams improve Program effectiveness and efficiency.  TST members generally spend one week per month in Washington, D. C. conducting reviews.

TST core members are required to have long-term and diversified experience with safeguards and security for nuclear materials.  Each member brings unique qualifications and experience to the team, representing a breadth of domestic and international expertise.  In 2004 the TST members included four Ph.D. scientists and had over 120 collective years of physical security, material control.  Occasionally, the TST calls upon other respected personnel with particular technical expertise or experience that is valuable to the TST, project and DOE Task Force Program personnel, for example maritime transportation, health physics, contract review specialists, etc.  

Staff at BNL manage the day-to-day operations of the TST project and maintain records of the reviews and issue papers.  

The job requirements associated with the position of a TST member include, but are not limited to, relevant experience in each of the following areas:
•Physical protection
•Material control and accounting
•Security analysis
•Safeguards and security
•Effectiveness evaluation of high-visibility government    programs
•International safeguards and security issues
•Inspections of domestic and nuclear facilities for treaty or  regulatory compliance
•Technical reviews
•Inspection and effectiveness evaluation of safeguards and security systems
•Ability to communicate findings and the rational both to the project teams and DOE upper management
•Preferably, experience should be gained by working at DOE sites that store and process nuclear weapons-useable materials  
•It is the policy of the TST to not use a person involved in the design of projects as a reviewer for those projects.  

In addition to these attributes, the prospective candidate must be able to: 
•Act at certain times as the TST Lead
•Take a major role in the scheduling, conducting, and evaluating- of selected TST reviews
•Have excellent oral and written communication skills, as the team is required after every project review to document their findings in a formal report.  
•Demonstrate a readiness and willingness to be involved in extensive domestic and potential international travel.
•Maintain an active DOE ‘Q’ Clearance
•Not perform services for other business entities or give the appearance of a personal or consultant conflict of interest with services performed under contract.

<DESC>SMALL LASER DESIGNATOR
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available ground laser systems.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to reduce the size and weight of the current ground laser designators.  Therefore, the AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to range and designate targets in a combat situation for the purpose of guiding munitions.  

These requirements are the attributes desired by the USAF:

1.	Mark (Designate) targets in excess of 4 km for the purposes of guiding airborne weapons and cueing the targeting pods and laser spot trackers in the aircraft.
2.	Determine range and location of a target from 30 meters to 4 km (+/- 5 meters) (O) 20 meters to 4km (+/- 5 meters) (T).
3.	Operate for approximately 30 minutes at 20 pulses per second (pps) in temperatures from -30 Celsius up to +50 degrees Celsius.
3.1.	  Goal is to operate for at least 4 cycles of 3 minutes on, 1 minute off
4.	Designator dimensions.
4.1.	Weigh as little as possible, not exceeding 4 lbs.
4.2.	Be as small as possible, cubing not more than 250 cubic inches.
5.	Use minimal batteries, with a goal of 2 lbs in total weight or less.
6.	Utilize a stabilizing system (tripod) if necessary (or be mountable on some other device) with a goal of 1.5 lbs in total weight or less
7.	The entire system (designator, batteries and tripod) should be as small and light as possible, not exceeding 8 lbs and consuming less than 500 cubic inches
8.	If possible within the constraints outlined above:
8.1.	Display coordinates of the target to include altitude in user selected units of measure.
8.1.1.	Intent is to provide accuracy sufficient to guide a weapon based on those coordinates.
8.1.2.	Display of azimuth and range, leading to manual calculation of the target coordinates, is less desirable.
8.1.3.	 Output the sensor data in an open format like Cursor on Target XML for target location that can be used to display on a mapping application already fielded.

Please Note:  As stated, these are simply the desired attributes of a laser designator.  Responses to this request do not need to meet all of these requirements.  Our review of these responses will focus on the tradeoffs between weight, size, cost and capability.  

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.	Rough Order of Magnitude cost estimate for delivery of two such items.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 21 Oct 05 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>Background:
The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) has a requirement to establish an Earned Value Management (EVM) process for both developmental and steady-state projects.

Statement of Need:
This notice is issued by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), an organization of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), as a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit responses from interested parties.  The OCIO is seeking sources able to establish an EVM program that will enable the OCIO and Project Managers (PMs) to assess the cost and performance of projects and track project deficiencies.  Additionally, the Offeror will provide guidance and assistance to the Project Managers in the use of EVM and will monitor and track EVM corrective actions.  

This notice, which is for information and planning purposes only, allows industry the opportunity to provide feedback on their ideas for the provision of services noted above.  This document will also verify reasonableness and feasibility of future program requirements and promote competition.  DOT intends to establish and implement EVM as soon as feasible and is looking for a single Offeror that can provide solutions and support for the issues listed below. 

This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by DOT, nor will DOT pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments.  No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI.  However, the information received through this RFI will be utilized to assist in formulating future requirements and an implementation strategy for Earned Value Management within the OCIO of the DOT.  A part of that strategy will include other competitive procurements, such as obtaining the actual EVM solution. 

Issues to be Addressed:
The Offeror must address the following items:

•	Establish an Earned Value Management (EVM) Program within DOT
The Offeror must be able to provide detailed information regarding its capabilities in being able to establish an effective program of Earned Value Management (EVM) for both developmental and steady-state projects.  The EVM Program must be structured to allow the OCIO and Project Managers (PMs) to assess cost and performance of projects.  The Offeror must be able to provide guidance to and work with the PMs in the use of EVM.  The Offeror will monitor and track corrective actions.

(Highlight relevant work performed).

In summary, the OCIO within the DOT requires the establishment of an Earned Value Management Program that will be complementary to and in support of OMB directives.

This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and DOT does not presently intend to award a contract at this time.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  DOT does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.  DOT reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. 

Sources interested in this requirement should send all relevant commercial literature (e.g., description of the services and products offered, specifications, price lists, etc.) and any other necessary information that demonstrates the above requirements can be met.  Information should be submitted by October 14, 2005 via electronic mail to sherrill.king@dot.gov and rhonda.robinson@dot.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command, Product Manager for the Test Equipment Modernization Program (PM-TEMOD) is responsible for the acquisition of the state-of-the-art, commercial/non-developmental general purpose test equipment. The new equipme nt will be used to standardize the inventory and replace existing obsolete test equipment. A draft specification has been developed for a Signal Generator that will replace 4 items in the Army inventory with one Signal Generator.  The items to be replaced are the SG-1207/U (NSN 6625-01-233-8615), SG-1207A/U (NSN 6625-01-436-9449), SG-1112(V)1/U (NSN 6625-00-566-3067), and SG-1112(V)2/U (6625-00-500-6525). The Signal Generator will be a bench top model that operates over the frequency range of 250 Khz to 2 G hz.  The signal generator will be capable of sourcing Carrier wave, Sweep, Amplitude, Frequency, Pulse, VOR, ILS, and Phase Modulation.  A questionnaire has been developed to assist the Government in defining the final purchase description/specification by  providing information about the technical capabilities of available commercial/non-development Radio Test Set. No decision has been made at this time as to the type of procurement, i.e. full and open competition versus small business set-aside. Interested  contractors may request a draft purchase description/specification and questionnaire by contacting Dennis A. Buckmeir, by email dennis.buckmeir@redstone.army.mil.  Request for a draft purchase description/specification and questionnaire should be made no later than 14 Oct 05.

<DESC>Provide a professional service  for community outreach, marketing communications and branding to help increase its visibility and create a premier image for the Corp of Engineers, Seattle District in Lation-Hispanic community. I. BACKGROUND - The Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, (the Agency) was founded in 1896 to provide a full range of civil and military services to the Pacific Northwest.  The Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, strives to better serve the community in the Pacific Northwest region by reaching out to the community members and informing them of career opportunities.  As an equal employment opportunity agency it is imperative that the community outreach targets all community members including minority ethni c groups.  The Latino-Hispanic community is one of the fastest growing minority ethnic group in the US and in the Pacific Northwest.  Washington State is one of the top 10 states that is experiencing the most Latino-Hispanic demographic growth.  It is impo rtant for the Agency to reach out to this minority ethnic group and to develop a brand image through community outreach to ensure that career opportunity information and opportunities are offered to the Latino-Hispanic community to ensure that the Agencys  workforce is diverse and representative of the communities that we serve.   II. PURPOSE - The purpose of this procurement is to contract for the community outreach, marketing communications and branding to help increase its visibility and create a premier image for the Corps of Engineers, Seattle District in the Latino-Hispanic co mmunity. A diversified workforce of cultures enhances the knowledge and teamsmanship of the various project teams for the Agency. The contractor shall be required to design and develop the concepts and layouts for all branding elements that reflect the def ined image of the organization. These tools may include, but not be limited to, press kit folder, brochures/pamphlets, newsletter masthead, presentation templates, publication covers and layouts, fact sheet formats, business card styles, web site appearanc e (but not structure), exhibit booth visuals, marketing materials, etc. and will include the design, color, style and usage that are consistent for all items used by the Agency.

III. SCOPE OF WORK - The requested work consists of three distinct components. They include:  (1)	Meeting with senior staff to communicate to the contractor the vision of how the Agency should be represented to its users and the general public.  The Agencys goals and measured expected results will be discussed at the meeting. The meeting will incl ude senior staff and appointed staff from the Agency and appropriate contractor staff. Contractor staff shall be responsible for directing the discussion with the input of the Agency staff to understand the vision and image for the Agency that is shared by  all participants. This session shall be summarized by the contractor and the conclusions of the meeting provided in a written summary document for review and approval before beginning development of the concepts. Following this meeting, the Agency will pr ovide the contractor a packet of all current Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, outreach material for their review.  (2)	The contractor shall be responsible for taking this shared vision for the Agency and developing a set of two concepts for Agencys staff to review. The concepts shall include preliminary designs and general outreach material layouts in Bilingual Spanis h-English language that represent the Agency in a manner fitting the shared vision. Once senior staff has approved the concepts, the Agency will have the opportunity to internally review the concepts with the Agencys employees and request any minor changes to be made until the items are satisfactory to Agency.  The contractor will also develop and present a community outreach strategy including the dates and events of local Hispanic-Latino events around the Pacific Northwest region,  an overview of each event and the strategy for each event.  The community outreach strategy will also include branding using internet, radio and print in strategic local Spanish media channels.  The strategy shall include developing a Diversity Partnershi p relationship with the contracted agencies to brand the Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, at the community level, to Latino-Hispanic career seekers, colleges and universities. The strategy will also include strategic relationships with Junior High/Hig h Schools as part of Latino-Hispanic community outreach.  (3)	Upon approval of concepts and strategies, the contractor shall be responsible for the production of both hard and electronic proofs (not to include printing) of communications materials and the implementation of the community outreach strategy.

<SUBJECT>SEABASE TO SHORE CONNECTOR
<DESC>The Seabase to Shore Connector (SSC) is the future craft for transporting vehicles and cargo from the seabase to shore.  It is also the planned replacement craft for the current Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) when those craft reach the end of their extended service lives.  The SSC will provide high speed, over the horizon, heavy lift capability to transport the personnel, equipment and material of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) as established for year 2015.  The SSC will have the ability to operate in the well deck of U.S. Navy amphibious ships; operate in planned amphibious and MPF ships; operate over beaches, ice, mud and marsh areas; operate in inland regions; ascend a beach gradient of five degrees from standstill and transport a cargo load of 140,000 pounds.  Requirements for the SSC are not finalized.  However, for purpose of this announcement, participants should assume that the SSC mus!  t have capability and performance equivalent to or exceeding that of the LCAC SLEP craft.  The LCAC SLEP is an air cushion vehicle with a design payload of 140,000 pounds, deck area of 1809 sq. feet and a speed of 50 knots at a Design Weight of 344,685 pounds.  At a minimum, it can operate in loaded conditions in a sea state where significant wave heights do not exceed one foot. The following performance improvements for the SSC compared to SLEP LCAC will be analyzed during development: the ability to operate in higher sea state conditions; increased payload, range and speed; reduced crewing; reduced maintenance and operational costs; and increased reliability and maintainability.   The SSC is in the early stages of development.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) is being prepared and approval of the document is expected in May 2006.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) will be conducted during FY 06 and a Systems and Technology Development (STD) Phase will follow in FY 07.  Preliminary and Final Design of the SSC will continue between FY 08/09.  Award of a contract for detail design and construction is expected in FY 10.  To support the SSC AOA and the STD Phase, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in November 2005 for concept studies and technology development initiatives.  The intent is to use a two phased approach.  NAVSEA intends to award up to five Phase I concept studies with a value up to $200K each.  Studies that are awarded shall require development of the concept to a point where the feasibility of meeting mission requirements can be assessed.  NAVSEA also intends to award up to ten Pha!  se I technology development initiatives with a value up to $200K each.  The technology efforts will be those that could enhance the capabilities and performance of the SSC.  Phase II contracts for additional development of a concept or technology may be made, without further competition, based on contractor proposals submitted at the end of Phase I.  Phase II contracts will not exceed $1M each. In preparation for the release of the BAA, an industry day will be held 2-3 November 2005 in Memphis, TN at the Memphis Marriott East Hotel.  The conference will start at 9:00 AM CST on 2 November and finish no later than 12:00 PM CST on 3 November.  A limited number of rooms have been blocked; reference the Seabase to Shore Connector Industry Day.  Hotel information is as follows: Memphis Marriott East, 2625 Thousand Oaks Boulevard, Memphis, TN 38118, Telephone: 901-362-6200, Fax: 901-360-8836, web site: http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/memtn.

Specific interest areas in the BAA in which USV efforts fall include: control systems and software to support sensors and unmanned operation; and adaptations of small craft design which may better support such sensor systems. The Workshop has been scheduled for October 18-20, 2005, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, at Naval Sea Systems Command, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue S.E., Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376. The length of the Workshop is anticipated to be three days. The Workshop will consist of a three hour plenary session during which the government will present some briefing material on USVs. Following the plenary session individual contractors will have an opportunity (20-30 minutes based on attendance) to brief a government-only panel on their ideas for designing and building a USV. During these sessions the Government panel may ask questions of clarification but will not respond to questions. In anticipation of the Workshop, a set of documents, related to USVs, including important interface considerations, performance goals and Government experience in the area of USVs, will be posted on the SSC San Diego e-Commerce Central website https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/. Attendance at the USV Workshop will be set up on a first come, first serve basis, however we will try to accommodate requests due to travel distance as much as possible. If you would like to attend the USV Workshop, please submit an email to the point of contact indicated at the bottom of this announcement 10 days prior to the start of Industry Day with a list of attendees. Due to space limitations, knowledge of attendees is critical. Following the Workshop, contractors who wish their proposals to be considered on this topic should submit proposals not later than 22 November 2005. These proposals will be evaluated as a group and will have a greater chance of being funded than proposals received after 22 November 2005. The Government intends to award one (1) procurement contract for a twenty-four (24) month period of performance to develop, fabricate and test two (2) prototype USV platforms, trailers and two (2) host workstations not including radio communication equipment. Radio sets will be provided as Government furnished property to the successful offeror. The Government expects delivery of two (2) prototype USVs and supporting design, maintenance and operation documentation to begin integration with Sonar Sensor Mission systems thirteen (13) months after contract award. The contract will include a future option for the fabrication of two (2) additional prototype USV platforms including trailers, based on the basic design. The option could be exercised up to ten (10) months after award of the contract. It is not necessary to attend the USV Workshop in order to propose a design and build effort. The main purpose will be for clarification. A transcript of questions and answers resulting from both plenary session and individual contractor sessions of the Workshop will be posted to the SSC San Diego e-Commerce Central website following each of the meetings. This USV Workshop announcement does not change the original BAA. Proposals will be accepted under the BAA until 11 July 2006. Information on the proposal format is included in the BAA announcement. Questions of a contractual or technical nature should be directed to Ms. Sylvia Evans, SSC San Diego Code 225, via e-mail: sylvia.evans@navy.mil or telephone (619) 553-3292. Questions and resultant responses will be posted to the website for general access.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-02 - Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor (MACS)
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) will host a Proposers’ Day conference in support of the Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor (MACS) program on November 4, 2005 at the George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, 3401 Fairfax Drive, Room 329, Arlington, VA.  The event will begin at 8:30 AM and continue until 5:00 PM.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the program, promote additional discussion on associated topics, and address questions from potential proposers.  

The objective of the MACS program is to successfully demonstrate a portable (< 1 cubic foot, < 30 lbs), ultra-sensitive (parts-per-trillion detection capability) chemical sensor based upon submillimeter/terahertz (THz) rotational spectroscopy.  This technology takes advantage of the quantized nature of rotational motion for gas phase materials, and provides unique chemical spectra for multiple analytes in parallel, with very little interference from background atmospheric clutter.  Further, rotational spectroscopy allows detection of many chemicals simultaneously, in a single sample, over a wide range of concentrations, without significant compromise in probability of detection or increase in false alarm rate.
  
The Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor will be capable of sampling the local atmosphere and determining the presence of chemical, biological, and explosives threats by means of their gaseous signatures.  This program asserts that unambiguous identification of such threats can be accomplished only by the rapid, simultaneous identification of the suite of gaseous chemicals that constitute their “signature”; accordingly, the sensor must be capable of identifying at least 300 molecular species in a single sample of the local atmosphere, within 10 minutes.  The sensor must have a 0.9999 probability of threat detection and 0.0001 probability of false alarm.

DARPA anticipates that an early focus of this developmental program will be the availability of compact THz sources of radiation and sensitive detectors, which have appropriate performance characteristics for identification of gases at the parts-per-trillion (PPT) level.  A system-level analysis would determine performance thresholds required for these and other components, such as gas sampling and signal processing.  While successful completion of the first phase of the program will require only the correct determination of a possible 30 analytes in an unknown mixture, the development of algorithms for robust identification of more than 300 analytes, within a few minutes, will be necessary by the end of the program.  This final capability should require only the addition of simple spectral information to digital storage, and require little added time for correct identification.

It is anticipated that DARPA will release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the program prior to the conference.  This BAA will encourage proposals for the full scope of the Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor development (i.e., an end-to-end system that is designed by a multidisciplinary research team, with coordination and implementation support from an integrator).  Therefore, potential proposers are encouraged to use the Proposers’ Day to discuss their organization’s capabilities and explore teaming arrangements with other conference attendees.

 
REGISTRATION INFORMATION

Those who wish to attend this conference must register NLT October 24, 2005 at the following website: https://enstg.com/signup/passthru.cfm?ConferenceCode=NET69843.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor’s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.
