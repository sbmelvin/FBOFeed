  The Objective of this acquisition is to obtain a 60 month lease agreement of a proven state of the art computer based Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) Network and replacement of a time-worn radiographic room with a Digital Radiographic System (DRS). The DRS generates X-rays, captures and converts X-rays to digital data, reconstructs and processes an image, then sends the image to the selected destinations via the PACS network. Types of services which are going to be run on the network include but are not limited to; file services, application services, database services, message/mail services and print services. The Agreement will include commercial equipment warranties and extended warranties as they apply and advanced service training.  The system must be retroactively fitted into an existing hospital and satellite clinic facilities.  This is the first such installation in this Service Unit.
  Overall program objective:  Develop a secure Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) Network that integrates all of the following:
-Modalities of a Radiological System i.e. Computer Radiology (CR), Digital Radiology (DR), Ultrasound (US), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Imagers, Digitizers.
-Software i.e. DICOM, Drivers, HIS/RIS, HL7, Broker, Tele Radiology, World Wide Web. 
-Hardware i.e. Network Cards, Switch/Hub, Cable, Media 
-Devices i.e. Disk drives, Printers, Mice, Modems, Monitors, View Stations
-Nodes i.e. Servers, Gateways/Routers, Archives, Redundant Array of Inexpensive Devices (RAID), Short Term Storage, Radiologist Station, Clinical Station, Patient Entry Station, Administrative Station, Voice Activated Dictation and Bar code System
  A DICOM Communication system such as Combination, or Hybrid Networking configuration with high speed, high capacity network media developed in accordance with Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model and IEEE 802 Specification Enhancements will be needed.
  Facility Background:  The Lawton Service Unit includes the Lawton Indian Hospital (LIH), the Anadarko Indian Health Center (AIHC), and the Carnegie Indian Health Center (CIHC).  
  Lawton Indian Hospital has 42 beds and a staff of 26 physicians who attend over 115 deliveries and perform approximately 900 surgical procedures per year.  This full-service facility offers inpatient care including general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, and pediatrics, as well as outpatient services in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, radiology, laboratory, nursing, optometry, and audiology, to name a few.  There is also a community health staff of nurses, educators, social workers, and sanitarians.  Over 2100 adult and pediatric admissions annually, combined with almost 65,000 outpatient visits to make this a busy health care facility. 
  Also in the service unit is a satellite clinic located in Anadarko, Oklahoma.  Anadarko is a small rural community of 6,500 about 64 miles from downtown Oklahoma City.  With a staff of 3 physicians and one physician assistant, the Anadarko health center handles nearly 35,000 outpatient visits each year. The 20,000-square-foot facility performs all of the usual outpatient and community services.  Its clinical laboratory, its radiology department, and its dental clinic are all currently modernizing as well.
  Another satellite clinic is located in Carnegie, Oklahoma; a small rural community of 1,500 is about 85 miles from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The clinic serves approximately 10,000 visits per year.  This clinic is a national test site for the Electronic Health Record.
