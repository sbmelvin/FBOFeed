<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Bosnia and Herzegovina in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement completion contract to implement a five-year program entitled the Governance Accountability Project, Phase II (GAP 2). 

Under the planned activity, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Netherlands Minister for development cooperation represented by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Bosnia and Herzegovina (EKN) seek to strengthen democratic local governance in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the implementation of this five-year program. Each donor has agreed to contribute $10 million over the five year life of project for a total of $30 million (subject to congressional and parliamentary appropriations).

GAP2 will provide demand-driven technical and material assistance to the 41 municipalities that have successfully participated in the original Governance Accountability Project (GAP 1). GAP2 will also select an additional 30 municipalities to receive core technical and material assistance, followed by demand-driven assistance.  In addition, GAP2 will provide targeted policy interventions in conjunction with mayors and municipal associations to improve the transparency, accountability and effectiveness of Bosnia-Herzegovina?s governance structures.  The Local Self-Governance Strategy, drafted by Bosnian mayors and policy experts, will form the basis for policy interventions.  Priority policy goals include Functional Decentralization (clearer definition of roles and responsibilities) and Fiscal Decentralization (predictable and adequate finances for service provision). Local ownership of GAP2 will rest primarily at the municipal level.  

The three bilateral donors of Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United States, have agreed to a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) for GAP2. USAID will carry out procurement steps to competitively select an implementer, and will conduct contract administration on behalf of the three donors.  All three donors will be engaged in strategic management and oversight of GAP2.  Although USAID will have the direct relationship to the contractor and is charged with contract administration, the donor ownership over project strategy and implementation is equal and shared among the three donors.  

USAID anticipates making an award in the range of $22.5 to $23.5 million. Sida shall provide a side fund of $6.5 million to be entirely transferred by the contractor to municipalities for capital projects.  Following the award of this Request for Proposals, the selected implementer and Sida will conclude a financial agreement concerning the $6.5 million side fund. 

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 
Firms or organizations and subcontractors whose their source, origin and nationality is in countries party to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and the cooperating country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are eligible to compete. At this time, 37 countries, including European Union (EU) member states and the United States, are parties to the Agreement.
USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S and non- U.S. firms, small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor. 
Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the FedBizOpps page: http://www2.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html, so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.

In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation is posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov). Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. 

Please do not contract USAID/BiH. All communication must be through this office. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>NOAA's National Ocean Service, Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) has responsibilities as a Federal trustee for natural resources under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended, to identify and assess risks to coastal marine resources from uncontrolled hazardous waste sites, in assessing natural resource injuries, and in developing plans for resource protection, restoration, and rehabilitation.  Early coordination and notification of potential natural resource injuries allows NOAA to carry out its responsibilities under CERCLA and the National Contingency Plan while minimizing interference in site cleanup schedules. Early coordination and notification of potential natural resource injuries allows Federal and state resource trustees to carry out responsibilities under Section 107 of the CERCLA, Executive Order 12580, and Subpart G of the National Contingency Plan while minimizing interference in site cleanup schedules.  The contractor shall perform various tasks that will identify and assess risks to coastal natural resources from hazardous waste sites and develop cost-effective strategies to minimize those risks.  The major tasks are:

Task A - Evaluate the potential for injury to NOAA resources from hazardous substance release.  This task shall require reviewing historical site files, evaluating data collected during hazardous waste site investigations, conducting site visits, and evaluating other literature that relates to contaminants, habitats, and species that may be affected by a release including: a) Providing natural resource data relevant to NOAA trust resources; b) Providing information on environmental fate and transport of specific contaminants in surface water, sediment, and biological pathways; c) Identifying environmental receptors, sensitive habitats, bioaccumulation potential, commercial and recreational use of trust resources; d) Specifying physical, biological, and chemical analytical procedures for aquatic environments; e) Identifying sample locations and frequencies; f) Evaluating the potential impacts of contamination on natural resource receptors; g) Identifying or reviewing alternative action levels for aquatic environments where regulatory standards do not exist; and h) Identifying potential adverse environmental impacts of alternatives.  

Task B - Conduct field survey of hazardous substances releases to document the extent of contamination in habitats and organisms of interest to NOAA.  NOAA shall identify the sites where these investigations will be conducted.  Specific field studies may require sampling to support: a) Evaluating the source and spatial distribution of contaminants to determine the significance of the release in relation to other potential pollution sources; b) Investigating the temporal distribution and fate of contaminants in the environment; and c) Determining the level of contamination in species of concern and evaluating the contribution of those contaminants to the degradation of trustee resources.  Investigations may include the use of biological assessment procedures such as bioassays.

Task C - Support environmental assessments of potential injuries to natural resources for which NOAA acts as a trustee or co-trustee resulting from releases of hazardous substances.  These surveys will be used by NOAA in evaluating appropriate remedial actions and reaching settlements with defendants in actions brought under CERCLA.  In general, the Contractor shall be responsible for gathering and interpreting information necessary to evaluate the potential ecological risks associated with releases from a hazardous waste site.  The surveys shall require: a) Interpreting data to evaluate concentrations of contaminants in aquatic habitats; b) Identifying pathways and habitats of concern and the data necessary to characterize the environmental setting of the site; c) Evaluating the potential impacts of contamination on natural resource receptors; and e) Identifying natural resources that could be affected by a site and complete NOAA site reports to identify threat to trust resources and the environment

Task D - Provide assistance in restoration planning (including injury magnitude and restoration scaling), restoration project alternatives analysis & selection, development of habitat restoration plans, assembly of pubic outreach materials and compiling information and documentation needed for NEPA compliance, EFH consultation, cultural resource evaluation and CZM consistency determinations and various other requirements for restoration projects considered for compensation for natural resource injuries, projects under consideration by a trustee council, or actually designated as part of settlements with responsible parties to resolve natural resource damage liability under CERCLA.  These plans, documents, reports and public outreach materials will be used by NOAA in evaluating appropriate restoration alternatives and establishing the appropriate documentation and project plans for meeting federal and state requirements for restoration project planning, public review, and implementation 

Deliverables include Coastal Hazardous Waste Site Reports, Preliminary Natural Resource Surveys, general site evaluation reports, supporting documents for ecological risk assessment reports and monitoring plans, database catalogs, and draft restoration plans, documents, reports and public outreach materials.  Progress reporting on sites reviewed and status of tasks for reports and databases will be required monthly.

This contract may be performed from any location in the continental United States.  Studies will be conducted primarily in coastal areas of the United States, territories, and protectorates.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price, labor hour or time-and-material task order IDIQ type contract will be awarded with a base 12-month period and four one-year option periods.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620 with a size standard of $6.5 M.   All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov/.  In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required.  

A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be available on or about January 25, 2008, through this website.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.

THIS RFP MAY BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF ACQUISITIONS(OA) HOMEPAGE AT http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/rcb-internet   INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS, IF ANY. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research, (CCR), Metabolism Branch (MB) is soliciting proposals for a Contractor that shall identify and recruit between 20 and 80 new patients with HTLV-1 Associated Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL) for inclusion in Phase I/II Clinical Trials at the NCI.  The offeror shall identify patients who meet the criteria specified by the Clinical Trials Protocols that will be provided to them by the MB, NCI.  Any potential contractor must demonstrate the ability to identify and provide follow up medical treatment and monitoring of patients diagnosed with HTLV-1 ATL. In addition, any Contractor must be able to assume follow-up monitoring of current patients being monitored in Jamaica. The Contractor shall provide the following:  (1) identify members of this specific patient population; (2) interaction with the staff at the NCI, assist staff and patients with compliance of the clinical protocols for treatment of the patients at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  Clinical Center, in Bethesda, MD (USA), and then follow-up when the patients have returned to their home country;  (3) perform patient diagnoses, pre-referral evaluations including laboratory data, post-referral evaluations, and  provide blocks and slides of tissues to the NCI; (4) assist patients in obtaining VISAs, passports and other documentation required for travel to the Washington, D.C. area airports, and to the NCI from their home country; (5) interact with the NCI staff electronically concerning patient issues; 6) comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USDA) regulations concerning Investigational New Drugs, adhere to all required Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations of the NCI, and comply with the ethical regulations of the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD (USA); and 7) adhere to any regulatory agency requirements in the Contractor=s geographic location. 

The etiology of HTLV-1 ATL is such that the human populations who carry this disease exist primarily in the Caribbean basin, specific limited areas of Japan, and sub-Saharan Africa, thus limiting potential participants for NCI studies to these locations.  This acquisition is a new project, however, it continues work that was part of prior NCI contracts N01-CP-40548 and N01-CP-21121. 

RFP No. N01-RC-81009-16 will be issued, electronically, on or about January 4, 2008, after publication of this notice. Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the issue date of the Requests for Proposal (RFP). One (1) four-year, cost-reimbursement contract award is anticipated.

<SUBJECT>A -- Facilities of Research Excellence (FORE) in Spinal Cord Injruy (SCI) - Training Program
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-08-01
<RESPDATE>022808

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering to support the development and implementation of a training program in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) research methodologies that will emphasize hands-on experience, at a site to be designated as a NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury.?  

The NINDS is the lead NIH Institute for funding of SCI research, and the major supporter of basic science to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.  In the United States, the incidence of SCI is approximately 11,000 per year.  Over the past three decades, academic researchers have developed and increasingly utilized standardized techniques designed to model human SCI in the rodent.  These include contusion, compression and partial or complete transection, and most have targeted thoracic spinal segments.  Several new models have been developed in recent years including mouse SCI and cervical injuries in both rat and mouse.  It is a great challenge for researchers new to the field to learn these procedures based solely on the literature.  It is difficult to learn to use these standard animal models of SCI with precision and to develop the expertise and facilities to adequately maintain and assess the animals after surgery.

SCI at different levels of the spinal cord result in a range of functional deficits in motor, sensory and autonomic functions.  A crucial element in conducting SCI research is to have the ability to evaluate the return of behavior and function in a careful and meaningful manner.  Behavioral measures of motor and sensory function have been developed, including the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor score, and more recently, the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS).  These metrics were developed to be sensitive to a range of injury severities, and are now used widely to assess novel therapeutic strategies, in conjunction with anatomical and physiological assessments.  New investigators require instruction and practice in the performance and use of these procedures in order to interpret their results accurately and reproducibly.  In addition, a number of other functional measures of forelimb and autonomic and sexual functions have been introduced recently, as well as training modalities and robotic devices designed to model rehabilitative therapies and monitor recovery.  Several of these measures were developed in previously awarded Facilities of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury (FORE-SCI) facilities and, as yet, have not been used extensively by other laboratories. 

A significant number of potential therapeutic approaches to protect and repair the injured spinal cord have been identified, but few of these have reached the stage of clinical trials and none have been successfully translated into clinical practice.  Among several key factors limiting successful translation, the quality and reproducibility of the reported results is one that can be directly addressed by training opportunities for investigators and trainees in laboratories undertaking SCI research.  Based on a series of workshops, NINDS identified several unmet needs in the field of SCI and issued a Broad Agency Announcement in 2002 to develop contracts for FORE-SCI for training in SCI research methods, replication studies, and development of improved outcome assessments.  To date, the FORE-SCI hands-on course has been run at a single site, for three continuous weeks annually, accommodating 16 students per year.  A report published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine emphasized the need for continuing instructional and collaborative opportunities in SCI research, specifically citing the training supported by the NINDS contract.  The NINDS now seeks to re-compete this effort by soliciting proposals for a program to teach standard SCI research techniques and to provide opportunities for hands-on experience with these techniques.  

This solicitation is for development and implementation of a training program in SCI research methodologies that will emphasize hands-on experience, at a site to be designated as a NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury.?  Its purpose is to provide short-term intensive training for researchers new to SCI research on the best practices in the field, including the standards of current research methodology, analytical procedures and functional outcome evaluations.  The FORE-SCI Contractor shall provide resources, capabilities and expertise in SCI research and the ability to work with multiple standard rodent models of injury.  The Contractor shall provide facilities and personnel for expert handling, care and medical management of animals with SCI, and FORE-SCI participants will become expert the ethical conduct of experiments in SCI and associated animal care.  The site will provide dedicated facilities and expertise for conducting surgery, including microsurgery such as transplants and grafts, and for cellular analyses ranging from neuroanatomy and histology to electrophysiology and other cutting-edge technologies.  This FORE-SCI program will provide training for participants, from graduate student to faculty level, to promote consistency of procedures and practices across laboratories.  

It is anticipated that this annual training program will yield a well-trained cadre of researchers dedicated to advancing research to relieve the burden of SCI.  A successful program will prepare FORE-SCI participants to return to their organizations/institutions with the ability to perform rigorous experimental programs of the highest quality, and to disseminate the techniques they have learned to others in their laboratories.  

Specific performance goals of this Contract are:

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing contracts to identify two NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury? (FORE-SCI) sites to conduct research to replicate promising studies that could lead to new and effective treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI).

The NINDS is the lead NIH Institute for funding of SCI research, and the major supporter of basic science to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.  In the United States, the incidence of SCI is approximately 11,000 per year.  In recent years, many laboratories have reported anatomical and behavioral indications that spinal cord tissue can be preserved and/or spinal circuitry regenerated in animal SCI models.  These novel findings have led to the expectation that these strategies could be translated into effective clinical treatments for SCI.  While there remains some question as to how much and what type of preclinical data will predict success in clinical trials, there is agreement that proof of principle experiments should be replicated independently in multiple laboratories and/or in more than one type of animal model.  To date, a significant barrier to the development of promising avenues to treatments for patients is the lack of independent confirmation of preclinical results.  This inability to confirm and characterize potentially important outcomes with confidence has prevented new approaches from moving forward to clinical studies.

Thus, a significant number of potential therapeutic approaches to protect and repair the injured spinal cord have been identified, but few of these have reached the stage of clinical trials and none have been successfully translated into clinical practice.  Among several key factors limiting successful translation, assessing the quality and reproducibility of the reported results is one that can be directly addressed by attempting to replicate and confirm promising studies independently.  Based on a series of workshops, NINDS identified several unmet needs in the field of SCI and issued a Broad Agency Announcement in 2002 to develop contracts for FORE-SCI for training in SCI research methods, replication studies, and development of improved outcome assessments.  To date, two FORE-SCI contracts have supported attempts to replicate published preclinical studies that show promise for development into new treatments for SCI.  Unfortunately and unexpectedly, none of these attempts have succeeded in confirming the functional gains reported in the original studies.  A report published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine emphasized the continuing need for replication of preclinical studies, naming this as one of six criteria for drug therapies entering clinical trials.  This report also states that ?an emphasis on the replication of preclinical studies (replication studies) between laboratories is needed,? citing the FORE-SCI centers as prototypes for this effort.  Further, it suggests that the effort also include ?broader studies that not only replicate a previous study but also include novel elements in the experiment.?  The NINDS now seeks to re-compete this effort by soliciting proposals for two centers to undertake replication studies to confirm exciting findings from the spinal cord injury field.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTRACT:

The proposed solicitation is to identify two NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury? (FORE-SCI) sites to conduct research to replicate promising studies that could lead to new and effective treatments for SCI.  The role of these two FORE-SCI centers will be to review and replicate novel treatments for SCI and to compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses.  It is anticipated that these centers will replicate at least one study per year, and make the results of these studies readily available to the SCI research community through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and other appropriate venues.  A successful program will demonstrate the capability to utilize multiple models of rodent spinal cord injuries, outcome measures and other experimental protocols to be used in the studies selected for replication.

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOALS OF THIS CONTRACT ARE:

1. To assess the scientific literature to select and then attempt to replicate promising, published preclinical studies of therapies that could lead to effective treatments for human SCI;
2. To compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses; and
3. To promptly report the methodology and results of the replication study to the research community.

It is anticipated that two cost-reimbursement type contracts will be made for a period of five (5) years in September 2008.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-08-02 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP No. NIHMH2008001) entitled NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program on or about Decenmer 31, 2007, under full and open competitive procedures.  

The general objectives of resultant contract are to receive and test approximately 2,500 coded samples per year (but could range from 2,000-3,000 samples per year) in broad-based human and rodent CNS receptor assays, enzyme screening assays, and functional assays, and to provide an electronic data file for each of the screened compounds.  At least 85% of these samples are to be tested in human recombinant receptor assays.  Samples for screening may include, but are not limited to:  novel chemical entities, structural analogs of lead compounds, genes or gene products, small molecules, enzyme inhibitors, and natural products. 

The specific requirements are:  (1) to establish and validate assays for cloned human or rodent receptors by cloning a receptor, maintaining a stably transfected cell line expressing the receptor, and establishing the binding and functional assays for the receptor in accordance with standards established in the published scientific literature; (2) to conduct screening of compounds in broad-based primary and secondary pharmacological assays (radioligand binding and enzyme assays), functional assays, and assays to assess brain penetrance, bioavailability, and cardiac toxicity, (3) to provide an electronic data file of screening results for each compound suitable for inclusion in a scientific publication; and (4) to regularly update and maintain a binding affinity (Ki) database for compounds and drugs. Award of one (1) cost reimbursement contract is anticipated on or about June 30, 2008, with a three (3) year base period and two (2), one (1) year option periods. 

The continued use of a deviation to the standard patent rights clause in FAR 52.227-11 Patent Rights - Ownership by the Contractor (Dec 2007) is being evaluated for this contract, to ensure the confidentiality and protect the intellectual property and patent rights of an investigator or party supplying a proprietary sample or composition of matter for testing under this contract.  The currently approved Patent Rights clause deviation applies to all discoveries resulting from routine pharmacological and functional screening activities involving the use of proprietary compounds.

Mr. Mustapha Geanah, Director

Weather Radar Network Feasibility Study

The Grantee, the Moroccan National Meteorology Department (DMN), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the installation of an upgraded and expanded national weather radar network to increase coverage throughout the Kingdom of Morocco.  This RFP is a re-posting of an earlier solicitation.  The Study will analyze the benefits of improved radar coverage, including the ability to predict and respond to the occurrence of natural phenomena.  The Study will recommend the most appropriate technical solution for upgrading and expanding the existing weather radar network in Morocco and will also develop a procurement plan and bidding documents for the recommended technical solution.

The impact of flooding on Morocco in recent years illustrates the need for modernization of the country's monitoring and weather forecast activities.  Accurate weather and flood forecasting is especially important for Morocco because of its strategic location between Europe, Africa and the Middle East, as well as its extended coastline along the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  As a consequence of its sprawling mountainous regions with high precipitation rates, and the presence of a wide valley of lowland watercourses, significant portions of Morocco's territory are subject to frequent flooding.  Because of the insufficiency of appropriate operational monitoring, warning, and forecasting systems, the country suffers recurrent damage from severe storms.  

The proposed Project would result in an effective national system for forecasting environmental crises and the ability to respond to those crises.  An improved radar network would therefore help eliminate and/or minimize the devastating impacts of these natural phenomena.  The system would enable Moroccan authorities to monitor meteorological and flood zone conditions, provide adequate advanced warning to threatened populations and ensure that local, regional, and central authority action and response is coordinated and planned based on the best information available.  Mitigating the catastrophic consequences of Morocco's recurrent cycle of floods and environmental disasters is one of the country's most pressing developmental priorities.  The Weather Radar Network Project also has the potential to help protect the Moroccan economy from disastrous economic shocks imposed by devastating environmental phenomena, particularly in the agricultural sector.  

The Terms of Reference for this Feasibility Study includes:

Task 1:  Kick-off Meeting and Review of Relevant Reports and Data
Task 2:  Station Visits and Diagnosis of all of the Modules of the DMN's Radar Network 
Task 3:  Review Statistics on Recent Climate Related Phenomena
Task 4:  Determination of Equipment Needs
Task 5:  Economic, Financial and Socio economic Analysis of the Project
Task 6:  Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment
Task 7:  Procurement Plan and Bid Package Preparation
Task 8:  Development Impact Assessment
Task 9:  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Mink Hollow Systems, Inc., 120 Ashton Road, Ashton, Maryland for an upgrade to the existing Synthia Robot Control to a Lab-View-based program in order to maintain the future operations and support.  The manufacturer of the original system no longer provides support or maintenance for this highly specific lab equipment.  Mink Hollow will incorporate control of the robot arm into the previously developed Synthia control code using LabView.  Mink Hollow is the only known source that will take the existing equipment and provide upgrades and maintenance.  Therefore based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to select and evaluate and award the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered.  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI313144 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Susan A. Nsangou.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Accordingly, this team shall be required to thoroughly understand these documents and their impact on our overall transformation  effort; recommend updates to them as appropriate; and provide continuity throughout the transformation period.<BR>This teams responsibilities shall include continuous review and recommended refinements to the above base documents; preparing measurable tr aining and exercise products, assessing training and exercises; preparing and leading transformation training and exercise after action reports; leading joint tactical discussions; and working side-by-side with USFK Action Officers and appropriate J Staff to ensure all transformation training and exercise requirements and deadlines are met.  <BR>This team will continuously keep USFK leadership apprised of transformation progress to include recommended adaptations to ensure all USFK Transformation requiremen ts are met by FY 2012.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware. It is needed in support of MDAs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. The Missile Defense Agencys mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats. Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system. Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology. IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet  a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test. No other software exists that affords the capability. Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture. Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencys requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programs mission.<BR><BR>IF AN ALTERNATE PRODUCT IS FURNISHED UNDER A CONTRACT OR ORDER FOR AN EXACT PRODUCT, THE ALTERNATE PRODUCT WILL BE AN UNAUTHORIZED SUBSTITUTION, AND MAY YIELD CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN ADDITION TO ANY CIVIL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The US Forest Service seeks an Environmental Consultant to perform the following project - 

This is a VERY small job valued at less than the requirement for posting in the FBO.  The Forest Service is seeking contractors who could do similar jobs on short notice, via direct contact for quote.  

For this task:

The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, permits, testing and incidentals necessary for the performance of the work specified in this Statement of Work. 

(1)  Conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in accordance with ASTM Standard 1527-05 on the parcels listed in the Background Section of this Statement of Work.  Depending on the results of the investigation, the FS may wish to exclude a portion of the parcel from the transaction and/or seek liability indemnification from the conveyor.  

By Phase I Site Assessment, we mean, the contractor shall assess the environmental conditions identified with the parcels associated with Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) liabilities and petroleum products.  This Site Assessment should also address the POTENTIAL for lead-based paint and/or asbestos containing materials that may be associated with the collapsed shed/cabin structure observed next to Eagle Creek in the northwestern portion of the property or any other structures found on the property during the investigation.

(2)  Conduct a Phase II Site Assessment in accordance with ASTM Standard 1903 in specific areas with visual evidence of mill tailings, acid rock drainage or potential environmental concern with LBP or PACM.  If none of these specific concerns are present, no samples are required.  Waste rock piles present that display no evidence of iron staining or other leachates do not constitute a recognized environmental concern without other data. 

The Phase II assessment should evaluate contamination of the surface water and soil pathways and may consist of water samples upgradient and downgradient of tailings piles of Acid Rock Drainage on the Eagle Creek and Spring Creek areas of concern.  Mill tailings samples should be taken where present and sediment samples taken in waterbodies directly downgradient of the piles.  The soil/sediment/surface water samples and any mill tailings samples taken shall be tested/analyzed for Nevada Profile 1 Metals for total metals (no cyanide).  Any other areas of potential environmental concern observed during this investigation shall also be sampled and tested accordingly.  

 
Technical and pricing proposals under seperate cover are due to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business on January 11, 2008.  Technical point of contact is Ken Maas at the USFS office in Sparks, NV  775-352-1223.

THERE IS ONE AMENDMENT TO THE ORIGINAL SOLICITATION.  IT IS POSTED HERE ALONG WITH THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS.  Please replace the appropriate pages in the original solicitation with the corresponding pages in AMENDMENT ONE before responding.  Amendment One must be acknowledged in order for quote to be considered.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@ustda.gov
<DESC>AMENDMENT 3: 

PPAC response to queries from M/s Jacobs Consultancy on RFP
Query 1. -- Section 1.1, page 5 states that "the time for the completion of the Technical Assistance shall be a period of 10 months...," however, page Annex II-7 indicates that the completion date for the TA is June 30, 2008.  Please clarify the anticipated project start date and completion date.
Clarification:   
The Technical Assistance start date and completion date shall be as per sub-section 1.1 (Background Summary) of Request for Proposal (RFP), which states, "The zero date for the Technical Assistance shall be the date of execution of the Contract with the selected Contractor or the date identified in the Contract. The time for completion of the Technical Assistance shall be a period of 10 months unless otherwise agreed to in the Contract between the Grantee and the Contractor."

The date of completion of the study indicated as June 30, 2008 in the Grant Agreement (Clause 8(A)) as well as in the USTDA Mandatory (Clause K(1)) was an estimated date of completion of the study. As finalisation of the RFP has taken much longer time than expected, the date of completion of the study is required to be extended beyond 30 June 2008.  

The zero date is dependent on a number of factors, including evaluation of the Offers, selection, contract negotiation, contract review and clearance by USTDA. Considering the above, the anticipated zero date appears to be in April 2008. 

Query 2. -- Section 2.3 Pre-Bid Meeting - Is attendance at the pre-bid meeting mandatory?  If so, what is the date/location of the meeting and is there an option for teleconferencing?
Clarification:

      Per Section 2.3 of the RFP, the Offerors and the Grantee may exchange queries and clarifications in writing through email and facsimile. Physical attendance of Offerors is not mandatory.  It is one of the options available to them.

The date, time and location of the Pre-bid Meet are given below:

Date / Time: 05.12.07 / 11:00 am to 05:00 pm (IST)
Location: 	Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC)

                   	7-Instiutional Area, Lodhi Road
                 	New Delhi - 110 003
Tel: +91-11-2436-1616
                      	+91-11-2436-0356

For details visit the www.fbo.gov at the link below, wherein notice for the Pre-bid meet has already been posted: -
http://www.fbo.gov/spg/TDA/TDA1/TDA1/Reference%2DNumber%2D0330043B/Modification%2001.html

Query 3. -- Section 2.3 Pre-Bid Meeting - How will the questions and clarifications be disseminated? Will they be posted on www.fbo.gov?

Clarification:

The questions and clarifications will be posted on the U.S. Government federal procurement website (www.fbo.gov). USTDA will also endeavor to send the questions and clarifications directly to those who have already requested the RFP.


Query 4. -- Section 2.12 Conditions Required For Participation - If the Contractor's or their US partner's India based staff is utilized for this project, is their utilization subject to the 20% of the host country resource limitation?

Clarification:

Refer clause 11 of the Grant Agreement (ANNEX 1 of the Request for Proposal) in particular sub-clause b), which states: "Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from Host Country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount."

In addition to above, in respect of Grantee contribution, the following may be noted: 

"All or any part of the US$230,000 Grantee Contribution referenced in the second sentence of Article 4 of the Grant Agreement may be paid to Indian subcontractors."
  

Query 5. -- Section 2.12 Conditions Required For Participation - Please clarify whether the 20% refer to the amount of hours or dollars funded by the USTDA grant.

Clarification:

Refer clause 11 of the Grant Agreement (ANNEX 1 of the Request for Proposal)


Query 6. -- Section 2.12 Conditions Required For Participation - Please confirm whether an employee of the Contractor who has permanent residence status in the US meet the USTDA nationality requirements.

Clarification:

Refer ANNEX 2 (USTDA Nationality, Source, and Origin Requirements) in particular point c) under the heading USTDA Standard Rule (Grant Agreement Standard Language) states: "employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S." 


Query 7. -- Section 3.5.1 Detailed Offeror's Consultancy/ Project Execution Experience - Does the limit of 5 consultancy experience and 3 project execution experience apply to each individual firm proposed for the project or the entire project team?

Clarification:
Please refer sub-section 2.2 (Definitions) of section 2 (Instructions to Proposers) for definition of Offeror, and Section 3 (Proposal Format & Content) in particular sub-section 3.5 (Experience and Qualifications) of RFP.


Query 8. -- Annex 1 Pipeline Integrity - Please clarify your expectations with regard to the intent that the Contractor designs a pipeline integrity program.

Clarification:
Please refer to the provision on Pipeline Integrity under Task 3 ? Technical Issues of the Terms of Reference, which broadly specifies the aspects that may be considered for a Pipeline Integrity management program for National Gas Grid in India.


Query 9. -- Annex 1 Task 2 Commercial and Financial Issues - Please clarify your expectations with regard to the Contractor discussions with representatives of potential lenders concerning the viability of the project.

Clarification:

Please refer to Task 2 of Terms of Reference, which inter-alia covers the following:

"Analyze the investment requirements and financing options for Project implementation, including:

An overall cost estimate, proposed ownership and financing structure, and schedule for Project implementation, and

A description of discussions with representatives of potential lenders; and to the extent the Project will be financed or guaranteed by the Host Country, a description of discussions with representatives of the appropriate Indian financing authorities."

It may be noted that the potential lenders are identified by the companies implementing a particular gas pipeline project. Therefore, contractor's discussion with representatives of potential lenders / Indian financing authorities will require clearance of the pipeline project implementing company. In this context, the Offerors may like to keep in view the provisions under sub-section 2.8 (Confidentiality).

Contractor's discussion with potential lenders may include the details of the structured discussions on issues such as their risk perceptions, risk mitigation steps, any innovative funding suggestions considering the infrastructure nature of investments and expectations of the lenders about the economic viability of the project. 
  

Additional Query (received in Pre-Bid Meet on 05.12.07):

In section 3.52, part D has a list of key staff (Project Manager, Development Project Engineer, Engineering Specialist, HSE & Pipeline Integrity Specialist, Hydraulic Specialist, Financial Specialist, Estimating Specialist & SCADA Design Specialist) proposed for this project. We would like to understand where the PPAC see these key staff relative to specific tasks defined in Annexure-1 - Terms of Reference for e.g. In what task would the PPAC expect the development project engineer to be involved or another way of saying this is what are the responsibilities of the Development Project Engineer.

Clarification:

Refer part D (Qualifications & Key Personnel Proposed for the Study) of Section-4 (Award Criteria). The list of Key Personnel / Staff provided is indicative only and the Offeror has to appropriately specify in the proposal and deploy the experts while carrying out the Technical Assistance, as may be required for fulfillment of the objectives and tasks under the Terms of Reference.

<CONTACT>tpatterson, 703-325-9088
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the unit of measure.<BR><BR>MARKET SURVEY:  DEEP TARGET DETECTION (MUNITION BASED TARGETS AND AT MINES).  The U.S. Army CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) Acquisition Center-Washington (CACW) on behalf of the U.S. Army RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Ground Vehicle Applications Branch is conducting market research to identify companies having technology, qualifications and capabilities  to demonstrate a ground vehicle mounted, high performance ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect both shallow and deeply buried in-road (under-belly attack) munitions based targets and antitank (AT) landmines.  The specific objective of the market resea rch is to identify companies that have both a mature shallow (less than 12 inches) close-in (down-looking) GPR system and the capability to rapidly mature such a GPR system to detect more deeply buried AT mines and munitions based targets (up to 36 inches) .  Maturity for this market research is defined as a minimum GPR technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 in a relevant AT mine, and munitions based target detection environment.  The GPR must have high real time detection performance for both deeply buried a nd shallow buried targets.  The system must have a real time operator interface which requires little direct operator involvement.  The Government may use results of this market research to formulate a near term program that integrates GPR technology onto a U.S. Army ground vehicle.  This future program may include the following Performance Objectives: detection of munitions based targets and AT mines on primary and secondary roads with a high probability of detection ( greater than or equal to 0.90), and a  low false alarm rate (less than or equal to 0.001 per square meter), with detection speeds up to 30 kilometers per hour; and the following Technical Objectives:  (a) Integration of an existing or modified (if needed) prototype detection system with a mann ed Army ground vehicle (b) Limited contractor performance and environmental testing of the prototype detection system to verify satisfaction of the performance objectives; and (c) Integration of a Government-furnished metal detector to provide an integrate d sensor suite capable of detection of the full range of threats (shallow buried, deeply buried, high and low metal content, and non-metallic).  This is NOT a request for proposal.  Companies who desire to participate in this market research are encouraged  to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications and capabilities to satisfy the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys specific do wn-looking GPR system and relevant performance test results, documentation supporting a maturity level of TRL 6 or higher or the companys approach to maturing the companys GPR technology to TRL 6 or higher within 18 months.  The white paper should also d iscuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the CACW Contract Specialist, Tina Patterson, at tristina.patterson@us.army.mil by  14 January 2008.  If submission cannot be made via email, the package may be mailed to US Army CECOM Acquisition Center  Washington, 2461 Eisenhower Ave, Room 1126, Attn: AMSEL-AC-WA (Ms. Tina Patterson), Alexandria, VA 22331-0700. The Government will no t reimburse interested sources or responders for any costs incurred responding to this request or for subsequent exchanges of information. Any proprietary information submitted should be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as p roprietary. All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

<DESC>Security Layers for Use in Security Booklet

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking a vendor to provide a system of security layers that will be part of a secure credential document.  This Request for Information (RFI) seeks information on the capabilities of security layer producers in the areas of security feature creation, design, necessary form factor creation, testing and adjustment for use with predetermined materials and timely delivery and service.

GPO is responsible for providing customer agencies with secure document systems.  The GPO will purchase annually two high security layers suitable for use in a secure booklet system.  The first layer shall be reverse laser imprintable and applied by heat sealing. Application may require that from 3 to 7 security layers be applied to separate booklet pages during a single pass through a booklet laminator. The second layer shall be affixed by a pressure sensitive adhesive over laser printing.  Both layers will be applied onto a wood-fiber based security paper that will be printed with standard security solvent sensitive inks.  

The GPO will purchase annually an amount necessary to meet our customer agencies needs.  The approximate quantity of laser imprintable heat seal security layers will be 650,000 and the quantity for the pressure sensitive security layers will be 20,000.

Due to the sensitive nature of this product the specific security features will not be listed in this RFI.  Some of the general security techniques and features that should be offered are controlled UV reactions, tamper evidence mechanisms, surface reflectance differences, solvent sensitivity, tactile features, photo realistic images invisible in daylight but viewable under UV light, photo chromic effects, and micro structural tags.

Keeping GPO?s goals in mind please outline how your organization would produce these products and suggest color laser printers and laminators that will work with provided security layers.  Production of these products may include several form factors such as multi-up sheets, single up sheets, tabbed products to allow for stitched in combined construction, and carriers that may be paper or polymer based.

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc.,  vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission b efore the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisti cians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR> The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain  the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revi sed quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I: <BR>Vendors wi ll be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company crite ria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase II: <BR>The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities ( MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Fa ilure to deliver samples by the requested deadline will result in exclusion from the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, using a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are; One (1) = not acceptable, Three (3) = acceptable, Five (5) = highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR ><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their Endo-Surgery Devices (Disposable). Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result in excl usion from the standardization process.  The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the peri operative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. The surgical staff at TAMC is represented by physicians in surgical residenc y and internship programs. <BR><BR>Vendors will also be required to provide NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, and NH Okinawa with product literature, training aides and tea ching materials, prior to the clinical evaluation process. Failure to provide product literature, training aides, and teaching materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group, utilizing this option, is a reflection of the stability of the clinical staff at these MTFs.  This in-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation proc ess for Tripler Army Medical Center:<BR>1.	Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to 	TAMC. One vendor per week will be evaluated.<BR>2.	Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the operating room staff. A pres entation 	reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and 	how to use the device will be addressed.<BR>3.	Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any 	questions, consultati ons, or guidance regarding the product.<BR>4.	All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility 	policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>The following steps are the training aid clinical evaluation pr ocess for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa.<BR>1.	Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to 	the clinical evaluation.<BR>2.	Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teaching aides provided by a vendor .<BR>3.	Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted.<BR>4.	Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance.<BR><BR>Phase III: <BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors will be  asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be eval uated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to offer a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion from the standa rdization process.<BR><BR>1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation<BR>The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Gene rally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators  have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the vendor has, or is ob taining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA  will be disqualified); and 6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR><BR>1.

<SUBJECT>A -- Nanoantenna Electromagnetic Collectors
<DESC>Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by the Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, develop, and commercialize a disruptive new technology for collecting energy that may dramatically improve efficiency and reduce production costs.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  INL may also be available to partner(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a partnership agreement.


***Background:       
Currently, photovoltaic (PV) cells are the only commercially-available source of direct solar energy conversion into electricity. However, standard PV cells are expensive, unwieldy, highly visible, and have an efficiency of less than 20 percent.  While new processes have increased the efficiency and flexibility of PV cells, only incremental steps have been achieved in the optimization of PV technology.  Also, existing portable energy sources depend on bulky batteries and incur high maintenance costs.  At the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory (INL), researchers have refined nano-scale antenna structures and associated manufacturing processes for large-scale products.  This promises to revolutionize the collection of solar energy, through dramatically improving efficiency and reducing production costs.

***Description:    
The new INL technology, which recently won two 2007 Nano50 awards, uses a special manufacturing process to stamp and deposit nano-scale antennas and backplanes of conducting metal onto a thin sheet of plastic.  These Nanoantenna Electromagnetic Collectors (NECs) could potentially cost a fraction of traditional solar devices, be imprinted on flexible materials and still draw energy after the sun has set.

As an alternative energy solar collector, NECs would be passive, cost-effective, have a reduced footprint, a minimal signature, and collect energy at night and during the day. Light, flexible substrates can be used, meaning NECs have the potential to be incorporated in vehicles and clothing shells as well as highly-portable panels. Easily-stored, ultra-light NEC panels can reduce weight and volume stresses, while providing an efficient, rechargeable energy source. In addition, batteries charged with NECs have the potential to be field-deployable, self-sustainable energy sources.

The INL?s Nanoantenna Electromagnetic Collectors show all the signs of a disruptive, transformational technology and promises to be a highly-efficient energy harvester.     

***Development Status:     
INL and its collaborating researcher partners have developed and tested a working prototype and have modeled the efficiency of the antennas? resonance at approximately 80%.  Next research steps for the INL and its research partners, as well as qualified industry partners, include battery storage and conversion to usable current frequencies.

***Intellectual Property:     
INL has filed three United States patent applications covering this technology.  

***Commercial Opportunity: 
INL is seeking industry and research partners to help develop and commercialize the NECs.  The ideal commercialization partner would have some or all of the following qualifications:
*  Experience in an alternative energy/solar energy business
*  Demonstrated ability to bring inventions to the market
*  Resources to make a significant investment in the development of this technology for commercialization
*  Interest in performing and funding cooperative research at INL
*  Willingness and ability to engage research partners with relevant specialized capabilities
*  Substantial manufacturing and research operations in the United States.


NOTE:     THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.     

Companies and research partners interested in developing and commercializing INL's Nanoantenna Electromagnetic Collector technology should provide a written statement of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice.  The statement of interest should include the following information:
1.  Company Name and address
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.  A description of business and technical expertise relevant to commercializing this technology
4.  A description of the entity?s motivation for pursuing this opportunity.       

Potential partners deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.   Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license may be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.    

Written responses should be directed to:

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), intends to award a cost plus fixed fee type contract to Liquid Robotics Incorporated (LRI), Palo Alto, CA.  SSC San Diego intends to acquire, on a sole source basis, engineering services, test support, technical support, and material to improve upon an unmanned autonomous surface vehicle, known as the Wave Glider, resulting in an open-architecture surface sensor platform. The performance period is anticipated to be five years in duration.  This procurement will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  Liquid Robotics Incorporated is the only known provider for this patent-pending item and has gained specialized knowledge and experience, the value of which would not be recovered through competition.  The use of any other contractor for this acquisition would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government based on the specialized knowledge and experience possessed by Liquid Robotics Incorporated.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.  See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>70 -- DHS S&T System Integrator Forum (SIF)
<DESC>1. The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate invites system integrators and government sponsors of information systems projects to attend the DHS S&T System Integrator Forum (SIF). It takes place on February 21, 2008 from 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.. This event will be located at the Doubletree Hotel Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia. The event will showcase several new cyber security solutions funded by DHS S&T that aim to remediate Federal and commercial cyber security vulnerabilities. 

2. The goal of the DHS S&T SIF is to introduce high-quality, top-performing research companies to large integrators of technology who serve the Federal Government and private industry. Each of the presenting technology developers have completed cyber security technology development projects funded under DHS Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) programs. They have been selected for participation in the SIF based on the maturity of their technology solutions, relevance to government needs, the apparent commercial viability of their approach, and their business leadership. These technology solutions represent cutting-edge innovations that have the potential to improve the security of the nation's cyber-infrastructure, while also reducing the costs required to protect cyber assets from attacks.

3. Those interested in attending the DHS S&T System Integrator Forum should represent an information services company that specializes in integrating information systems and corresponding security capabilities that meet Federal Government and private industry requirements. The SIF is an ideal venue for system integrators, chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief information systems security officers, purchasing decision-makers, and government sponsors of system integration programs. At the SIF they can learn about opportunities to integrate capabilities resulting from DHS S&T?s investment in cyber security technology development. The event is NOT a venue for researchers or small businesses seeking funding or networking opportunities.

4.  The DHS reserves the right to modify the agenda until the date of the event, but the forum may include the following presentations:  

a. Secure USB flash drives with hardware encryption and 2-factor authentication, featuring centralized policy management, secure password management, and integration with end-point security

b. An advanced botnet and malware detection and diagnosis system that harnesses best practices in enterprise-level physical memory forensics with automated binary reverse engineering capabilities 

c. Vulnerability analysis tools that model cyber network penetration, based on the network configuration and known vulnerabilities, producing a view of all potential multi-step attacks through the network  

d. A tool for deep analysis and transformation of software (in either source or binary executable form), with application to security-vulnerability discovery, assurance, and anti-tamper protection

e. Pattern recognition and data analysis tools to quickly write and test network signatures, allowing for the determination of new security threats through positive-negative enumeration  


5. The event is free of charge and includes continental breakfast and lunch.

6. Register for the DHS System Integrator Forum by January 25, 2008, by visiting http://www.cyber.st.dhs.gov/siforum08.  Space is limited.

7. This announcement is not a request for proposal.

BACKGROUND:  

The USAID Mission for the West Bank and Gaza manages the overall U.S. assistance program to the Palestinians. This assistance program is an integral part of the U.S. support for the Palestinian-Israeli effort to create and maintain a peaceful co-existence, and as such it reflects the demands of a continually evolving political and economic environment. It is implemented against the backdrop of ongoing conflict and negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel. The USAID program is intended to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza; promote a competitive market economy; foster the effective use of scarce resources; promote the development of a democratic society; encourage sound public management and provide emergency or humanitarian assistance when needed. The program has obligated $1.5 billion since 1994 on the WBG development program. In per capita terms, this is one of the largest USAID programs in the world.

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking proposals (Standard Form 171 or Standard Form 612) from persons interested in providing the PSC services described below.  This is a diverse and politically sensitive program and is one of the few USAID Missions worldwide without a bi-lateral agreement with a host government.  

In December 2007, the management of the current Office of Transition Initiatives? contract will transfer to USAID/West Bank and Gaza?s DGO. The program will be renamed ?Palestinian Democracy Strengthening Program? (PDSP), and is designed to strengthen Palestinian democracy leading to the establishment of a democratic, viable Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  The initiative provides targeted support to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders, and helps to build broad-based support for the peace process.

The DGO portfolio is currently valued at approximately $75 million, and includes programming in the areas of judicial reform, rule of law, local governance, independent media, government accountability and transparency, elections, and conflict management and mitigation.  The DGO programs approximately $20 million annually.  The PCEP will complement ongoing programming in the DGO and deepen overall impact of existing U.S. Goverment-funded democracy and governance initiatives.   


POSITION DESCRIPTION:


The Palestinian Civic Engagement Program Senior Advisor will be based in Jerusalem at the U.S. Consulate in West Jerusalem.  The Incumbent will serve as the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for the $25 million, high profile Palestinian Civic Engagement Program (PCEP) designed to strengthen the political transition that strengthens the establishment of a democratic, viable Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  The program provides targeted support to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders, and helps to build broad-based support for peace initiatives.  The Incumbent works with local DGO staff and reports directly to the DGO Director.

The PCEP is designed to strengthen the political transition leading to the establishment of a democratic, viable Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  The initiative provides targeted support to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders, and helps to build broad-based support for the peace process.  

The PCEP supports four main objectives: (1) Support to democratic processes critical to a viable democratic state; (2) Strengthen civil society organizations in support of positive democratic change and increased government accountability and transparency; (3) Increase public confidence in local authorities and respect for the rule of law by addressing community safety issues; and (4) support initiatives that advance the vision of a negotiated settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict leading to a viable, democratic Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  Programming includes a robust small grants component designed to provide commodity support and technical assistance to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders.  Small grants will range from $10,000 to $100,000 on average, though larger grants may also be considered.  The PCEP directly supports U.S. Government political objectives, and the Incumbent will work closely with U.S. Government officials, including those at USAID and the Consulate General in Jerusalem.

The PCEP works with a broad range of Palestinian counterparts, including Palestinian ministries and independent institutions, civil society organizations, local leaders, among others.

The contractor will screen dental patients, recommend and perform follow-up care, provide dental hygiene services if indicated and perform other duties as assigned by the Health Services Administrator.  The contractor will make a legible note, including patient education, for each patient.  Each note must provide sufficient details allowing another dentist to assume dental care of the patient based on those notes.  All duties shall be performed in accordance with standards and methods generally accepted within the field of Dentistry, and compliance with all Federal and State policy and regulations.  The contractor shall adhere to all standards and regulations associated with The Joint Commission and American Correctional Association Foundation/Core Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.  Patient history and evaluations shall be completed as scheduled.  Detailed medical record documentation must be maintained.  The contractors performance shall be monitored by the HSA.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

1.	Requiring Activity: AFCESA/CEMIRT OL-A
	                                 
2	Description of Requirement: These switchboards and panel boards are electrical devices used as switching centers to distribute electrical power while providing protection for electrical circuits. These equipments are manufactured by Eaton Cutler Hammer and are required for electrical construction as part of a major project in progress to upgrade entire electrical power plant supporting critical areas of HQ PACAF facility at Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  

3.	Statutory Authority:

10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

4.	Justification or Authority for action:

a.	The Eaton Cutler Hammer brand required for the panel boards and switchboard is essential to match numerous switchboards and panel boards already existing and in service throughout the HQ PACAF building. This provides uniformity of equipment and allows interchangeability of critical parts to accomplish emergency repairs when required.

b.	Other replacement parts available through shop and bench stock already established for existing Eaton Cutler Hammer switchboards and panel boards can also readily support required periodic maintenance and repair of these new equipments.  
 
c.	Eaton Cutler Hammer is a very common brand for numerous electrical equipment and devices and most if not all reputable electrical vendors carry and distribute Eaton Cutler Hammer products.    

5.	Market Survey/Other facts:  Market survey was not performed as Eaton Cutler Hammer is the only brand compatible with maintenance support established for other existing electrical equipment in the facility.   

6.	Steps to improve competition:  No efforts are being made at this time because this is the only brand required to support the compatibility issue. 

7.	Certification:  I hereby certify that the above information is complete and accurate.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
FOR
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)
FORGING TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
NOVEMBER 13, 2007
________________________________________
POINT OF CONTACT: 	Mr.  John Dormer, Contracting Officer  
Defense Supply Center Philadelphia
DLA Contracting Support Office DSCO-P
700 Robbins Avenue, Building 36-2
Philadelphia, PA 19111

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is soliciting proposals for its forging technology research and development program to be jointly funded by the DLA and the Army.  The program seeks to demonstrate readiness improvements by developing and applying innovative methods of designing, manufacturing and buying weapons systems spare parts and components through advanced forging technologies.  Technical oversight of the projects selected for funding under this BAA shall be performed by DLA and the Army.  Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $15 million is planned during Fiscal Years 2008-2012 for funding efforts selected from this BAA.  Proposals for less than the total amount and shorter than the total duration will also be entertained.  The government is anticipating the award of cost sharing contracts.

2.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION
Proposers must submit an original and five (5) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0001-08 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 18 January 2008 in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in forging technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  




3.  AREAS OF INTEREST
Areas of interest, in no particular order, include: (1) Rapid Tooling - identification and demonstration of manufacturing processes to produce rapid tooling for forged item prototyping.  Applications span the array of ?hand-held? sized forged items used in various military systems such as mortars, howitzers and tank cannon.  (2) Process Modeling ? identification and demonstration of forging process modeling technologies to optimize forging die design; process parameters to achieve fewer full scale iterative processing trials on such Army items as 60mm, 81mm and 120mm mortar baseplates.  (3) Predictive Performance ? the identification and demonstration of innovative modeling and simulation technologies to predict end (forged) item performance ? as applied to such Army items as howitzer and tank breech rings, breech blocks and tubes.  The projected benefit is substantially reduced costs for item qualification via modeling and simulation versus full scale firing testing.  (4) Alternative Materials ? identification and demonstration of advanced materials designed and optimized specifically for forge processing to improve item service life and sustainability.  Applications encompass most Army ground weapon systems. (5) Lean Six Sigma manufacturing demonstrations to reduce variability and waste in forging manufacture.  (6) Tools for technical data package review and modernization at Department of Defense Inventory Control Points. (7) Tools for evaluating and streamlining forging supply chains for best value supply source selection. (8) Multi-material, multi-method evaluation of various forging technologies for application-specific problems.  Offerors are encouraged to innovate and are not limited to proposing exactly these technology and application areas. DLA provides logistics support to all of the Military Services and is interested in all weapon system applications.

<DESC>H92244-08-T-0025 Amendment Number 1  Questions and Answers.

1.  Is there an incumbent providing these services?
Answer:  No.  The Annual Command Operations Report is currently being completed by Command personnel as a collateral duty.  The Database part of the requirement is new and has yet to be developed/accomplished.

2.  May I have info on the scale of the Database to be developed?
Answer:  The scale of the Database to be developed will be up to the offeror based on their expertise and determinations from the requirements in the SOW.

3.  Is there an existing Database or does the contractor have the option of using commercially available software?
Answer:  The Command ADP personnel will design and provide software for the Database based on the awarded contractor?s determinations.  The requirement is for the offeror to determine what to include, how to best organize it, to identify what data to capture, and finally, to populate the Database (that will be built by our Command ADP personnel based on the fore mentioned results) with the data.

4.  What is the anticipated scope in manpower for this advertisement?
Answer:  Only very rough estimates can be provided as the manpower/time required will depend on several factors.  The forecasted rough ?best? estimates for manpower are as follows:  30-50 hours per month for NINE months for CLIN 0001.  40-60 hours per month for THREE months for CLIN 0002.  For option one, CLIN 0004, 40 to 60 hours per month for THREE months.  For option two, CLIN 0005, 30 to 50 hours per month for TWO months. 

5.  How many NSW background employees are needed to complete the report portion?
Answer:  It is envisioned that all personnel working on the requirement would have the required background. 

6.  How many SECRET positions will be required?
	Answer:  Same as answer to number 5 above.

7.  Are travel costs to be charged separately and should they be included in proposals for CLIN 0003 and option three CLIN 0006?
Answer:  Travel costs will be charged on an as needed basis and only with prior permission of the Government, limited to the allowances of the JTR.  It is requested that you estimate your amount required for travel (lump sum amount only, no cost breakdowns required) for each CLIN 0003 and 0006.

8.    Under para (3), "Period of Performance" the RFQ states an exact timeline for completion of the FY07 Command Operations Report (CLIN 0002). Does this time line for CLIN 0002 take priority over the data base establishment described in CLIN 0001?   Specifically, can CLIN 0001 (the data base project) begin after the final FY07 Command Operations Report is submitted (CLIN 0002)?
Answer:  The timeline is up to the offeror.  The requirement is that CLIN 0002 (Operations Report) be completed and given to the Technical POC by 29 February 2008 and CLIN 0001 (Database Population) be completed nine months after award. 

9.   Options and Cost Projections:  Should the response to the RFQ break the price down into completion of CLIN's 0001 and 0002 and then Options 1 (CLIN 0004) and 2 (CLIN 0005); or, should the total price be submitted as one figure for the full 9 months of award?
Answer:  Please provide a quote/price for each separate CLIN (0001 thru 0006) and include the grand total.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Logistics Specialist in Washington, DC. 

The purpose of this amendment is to provide Attachments 1 and 2 as referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

In addition, the Mission has 30% Cost Of Living Allowance (COLA), 5% Post Differential and 20% Danger Pay. The salary will be determined based on past salary history, working experience and educational background of the successful candidate.

BACKGROUND:  

The USAID Mission for the West Bank and Gaza manages the overall U.S. assistance program to the Palestinians. This assistance program is an integral part of the U.S. support for the Palestinian-Israeli effort to create and maintain a peaceful co-existence, and as such it reflects the demands of a continually evolving political and economic environment. It is implemented against the backdrop of ongoing conflict and negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel. The USAID program is intended to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza; promote a competitive market economy; foster the effective use of scarce resources; promote the development of a democratic society; encourage sound public management and provide emergency or humanitarian assistance when needed. The program has obligated $1.5 billion since 1994 on the WBG development program. In per capita terms, this is one of the largest USAID programs in the world.

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking proposals (Standard Form 171 or Standard Form 612) from persons interested in providing the PSC services described below.  This is a diverse and politically sensitive program and is one of the few USAID Missions worldwide without a bi-lateral agreement with a host government.  

In December 2007, the management of the current Office of Transition Initiatives? contract will transfer to USAID/West Bank and Gaza?s DGO. The program will be renamed ?Palestinian Democracy Strengthening Program? (PDSP), and is designed to strengthen Palestinian democracy leading to the establishment of a democratic, viable Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  The initiative provides targeted support to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders, and helps to build broad-based support for the peace process.

The DGO portfolio is currently valued at approximately $75 million, and includes programming in the areas of judicial reform, rule of law, local governance, independent media, government accountability and transparency, elections, and conflict management and mitigation.  The DGO programs approximately $20 million annually.  The PCEP will complement ongoing programming in the DGO and deepen overall impact of existing U.S. Goverment-funded democracy and governance initiatives.   


POSITION DESCRIPTION:


The Palestinian Civic Engagement Program Senior Advisor will be based in Jerusalem at the U.S. Consulate in West Jerusalem.  The Incumbent will serve as the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for the $25 million, high profile Palestinian Civic Engagement Program (PCEP) designed to strengthen the political transition that strengthens the establishment of a democratic, viable Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  The program provides targeted support to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders, and helps to build broad-based support for peace initiatives.  The Incumbent works with local DGO staff and reports directly to the DGO Director.

The PCEP is designed to strengthen the political transition leading to the establishment of a democratic, viable Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  The initiative provides targeted support to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders, and helps to build broad-based support for the peace process.  

The PCEP supports four main objectives: (1) Support to democratic processes critical to a viable democratic state; (2) Strengthen civil society organizations in support of positive democratic change and increased government accountability and transparency; (3) Increase public confidence in local authorities and respect for the rule of law by addressing community safety issues; and (4) support initiatives that advance the vision of a negotiated settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict leading to a viable, democratic Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors.  Programming includes a robust small grants component designed to provide commodity support and technical assistance to democratic actors, including civic and local leaders.  Small grants will range from $10,000 to $100,000 on average, though larger grants may also be considered.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amended to address vendor question and answers that have been received for this requirement.  The due date for quotes remains unchanged and all responses must be submitted no later than 3:30pm, local time on December 19, 2007 for consideration.
Question: What material are the floor, ceiling and walls made from?
Answer: The accordion doors will be mounted inside existing closets that have the opening sizes referenced within the notice.  The flooring will be existing carpet, the walls are plaster and the ceiling where the doors shall be mounted is either drywall or plaster.  
Question: Are these replacement doors?
Answer:  Yes, these are replacement doors, but not exact replacements.  These are replacing inexpensive, plastic/vinyl doors that are not consistent with the decor in the room.
Question:  Will the old doors need to be disposed of? 
Answer: Yes, the existing doors shall be discarded. 
Question:  What are STC requirements?
Answer:  The STC requirements are minimal since these doors will be used on closets. 
Question:  Natural wood accordion doors that are fire rated are difficult to locate, would vinyl with wood appearance be considered?
Answer: Spec (10) states "For performance requirements, the door panel CORE material shall be class 1 fire retardant, not the wood veneer.  Vinyl is not acceptable.
Question: Can the overhead mount be made of wood?
Answer: The overhead is concealed for the most part.  The track is metal, whatever the track is attached too can be wood, but must be finished. 
Question: Do all 5 doors stack to 1 side?
Answer: Doors shall stack both sides from the center.
Question:  There are four (4) wood species available (Birch, Walnut, Oak and Mahogany) each has a different cost. Please advice species required.
Answer: The hardwood type is not as critical as the color match to the existing surroundings.  Birch or maple stained to a darker walnut tone is acceptable. Factory stained Birch, or something comparable, to match the surrounding walnut tones will be sufficient.  Samples must be submitted for selection.
Question:  Is installation on first floor or an upper floor? If and upper floor, can equipment travel by elevator? 
Answer: The work is being performed on two separate floors (basement and first floor level), both accessible by doors and not requiring elevator usage.
Question: Can installation be done during normal business hours?
Answer: Installation may be required to be performed evening or weekends. It is possible it could be done during regular hours, but until NIST knows the exact delivery time of the doors, NIST cannot set aside regular time for the conference rooms to be closed.  Therefore, there is a possibility for the need for work outside of normal business hours.
Question:   Is there a wage scale requirement?
Answer:  Yes, In accordance with 52.2222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, Wage Determination No.: 2005-2103, Revision No. : 4 dated 07/05/2007 shall apply.

<DESC>This amendment is hereby created to clarify the following:<BR><BR>1.  The Cone Drawing is now available for download.<BR><BR>2.  The drawings show 8 inch pipe, but as according to the specifications the pipe is 4 inch.<BR><BR>3.  The slot is to be ma chined/ground smooth and clean (no rough edges)<BR><BR>4.  There are 2 pipe brackets to be mounted on the pipe at each of the 4 mounting locations.<BR><BR>5.  The drawings incorrectly removes the need to sand blast the brackets.  The brackets need to be sa ndblasted.<BR><BR>6.  The contractor will provide all material needed to complete the job for the brackets (both the pipe brackets & the Dam brackets), the cones and caps.<BR><BR>7.  All 82 of the 40' sections will be welded together- the example of (3) 40 ' sections welded together into 120' lengthe for John Day and (2) 40'sections welded together into 80' lengths for Bonneville would apply to all the 40' sections.<BR><BR>8.  The Dam Brackets and Funnel cones are to be provided loose and ready for mounting. <BR><BR>9.  The welding will be done at one time (2 days for Bonneville and 5 days for John Day Dam).
