These contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, groundwater, air, sludge, surface water, or man-made structures. The contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other DOD facilities.*****

POSITION DESCRIPTION: Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor and Team Leader

A. BACKGROUND

The USAID Mission to the Kingdom of Nepal has a 50 year track record of assisting with improving the quality of life of people in the country.  Currently, the USAID/Nepal Mission Strategy addresses Nepal’s most pressing development challenges in the context of a ten-year old conflict with political, social and economic elements.  The root causes of the conflict have been exclusion, lack of representation, poor service delivery, poverty, and corruption. The key actors – the King, Political Parties, and the Maoist rebels – are at an impasse, which has led to political instability.  

USAID/Nepal is in the process of developing a three-year strategy (2006-2009) to help achieve the goal of a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Nepal.  Assistance is targeted to address key development challenges in conflict, health, economic growth, and democracy and governance.  Democracy and Governance (DG) is a critical area of focus in Nepal, where the restoration of democracy is a major US foreign policy objective.  A stable democracy and good governance are essential in creating an environment for peace and a resolution of the conflict.  

B. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION 

The Democracy and Governance program falls under the management of the General Development Office (GDO), which also includes programs in economic growth and agriculture.  The Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor will serve as the DG Team Leader and as Acting General Development Office Director in the director’s absence.  The incumbent will advise the USAID Mission on all issues and programs pertaining to democratic development and DG programming.  The position plays a leading role in strategic planning and donor coordination, report writing, as well as in managing DG resources, working with implementing partners, and supervising the DG team.  The incumbent will report directly to the Director of the GDO, and indirectly with an open channel to the USAID Front Office (Mission Director and Deputy Director) on DG matters.  And as DG Team Leader he/she will be responsible for managing the DG team comprising of one high level USPSC and four senior FSNs (Foreign Service Nationals).  

The current DG program is comprised of the following activities:

-	Strengthening rule of law and anti-corruption
-	Supporting elections and political processes
-	Improving capacity for natural resource management /local governance
-	Combating trafficking in persons

USAID/Nepal envisions expanding these activities in the new strategy period.

In addition, the Senior DG advisor will serve as Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) directly responsible for managing some of the activities within the DG program.  

This position requires broad exercise of individual judgment in setting priorities, managing resources, implementing programs, and coordinating relations with high-level representatives inside and outside the USG.  The political and governance issues that the incumbent will be dealing with are of the highest priority to the US Mission in Nepal.  The environment is unpredictable and the incumbent must be flexible and able to adjust to rapidly changing circumstances. The position also has a broad range of complex managerial, analytical and informational responsibilities, including providing overall direction for achievement of USAID DG objectives, as well as data collection, monitoring & evaluation, documentation, reporting, responding to queries from various sources, coordination, advice and management of the Mission’s DG programs.
