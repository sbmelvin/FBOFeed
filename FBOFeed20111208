<CONTACT>Capt John Sharkey, Contracting Officer, Phone 3106539476, Email john.sharkey@losangeles.af.mil - Hyun S. Choi, Contracting Officer, Phone 3106533500, Email hyun.choi@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Infrared Space Systems Directorate (IS) Program Office intends to release Request for Proposal number FA8810-11-R-0001 for the Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) Satellite Replenishment Production (SRP) - Initial Obsolescence Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) on 23 December 2011. The Government's intent is to make a sole source award to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company.
<p>The SBIRS constellation consists of geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites and highly elliptical orbit (HEO) payloads. Its mission is to warn against global and theater ballistic missile attacks. Presently, the SBIRS program includes four GEO space vehicles (SV) and four HEO payloads in procurement under the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and SBIRS Follow-on Production (SFP) contracts. In order to support a future SBIRS Satellite Replenishment Production (SRP) acquisition, this particular acquisition will procure critically needed Obsolescence Non-Recurring Engineering to support the GEO 5&amp;6 block buy. This contract will initiate production procurement of high-risk, schedule-critical NRE activities for the GEO 5 and subsequent space vehicles (SV). This limited development effort will also procure a limited set of available flight-qualified components that, if not acquired in advance, would result in substantial increased costs to the Government. In addition, the Government plans to initiate NRE activities for the TRANSEC modernization for GEO 5&amp;6.</p>
<p>The contract type will be Cost-Plus Incentive Fee. The intended contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, 1111 Lockheed Martin Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1212. The IS Program Office has contracted with LMSSC over the last 17 years. LMSSC is the original and the only responsible prime source that can deliver the required services. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays; therefore, there are no viable options to obtaining competition for this procurement.</p>
<p>The small business size standard (number of employees) for this requirement is 1,000 under NAICS Code 336414. Contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LMSSC directly.</p>
<p>Points of Contact:<br />Technical: Lt Col David Menke, Program Manager, (310) 653-1934, David.Menke@losangeles.af.mil<br />Contracting: Capt John J Sharkey, Contracting Officer, (310) 653-4570, John.Sharkey@losangeles.af.mil or Lisa Chin, Contract Specialist, (310) 653-4141, Lisa.Chin@losangeles.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:matthew.g.hudson@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is to advise industry that SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic intends toissue Request for Proposal N65236-11-R-0036 for the purchase of iDirect HubRouter Systems, hub cards, satellite modems, satellite routers, extendedwarranties, and training for this equipment and ancillary items used to enhancesystem performance. The primary users of the equipment are the DoD andFederal Civilian Agencies throughout the Government.The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 334290 with a size standard of 750employees.  The Government estimate for this effort is approximately $85million. A firm-fixed-price, performance based, indefinite delivery, indefinitequantity, commercial item contract is anticipated. The ordering period willinclude a base year with four one-year options. Multiple awards may be madeto authorized distributors/resellers of the iDirect brand name equipment andancillary items.  As requirements are identified, delivery order awards will becompeted among the distributor/reseller contract holders. Questions pertainingto this notice may be directed, in writing, to Matthew G. Hudson, ContractSpecialist, at matthew.g.hudson@navy.mil.The subject procurement will be solicited on a sole-source basis with brandname restrictions as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(c) and justified in accordancewith FAR 6.303 and 6.304.  The resulting justification and approval documentwill be posted with the RFP in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).Several unique qualities of the iDirect system necessitate brand namerestrictions.The iDirect systems use the Deterministic-Time Division Multiple Access (D-TDMA) scheme upstream.  The Hub router constantly analyzes the networkdemand and allocates bandwidth to each remote location based on trafficdemand at each remote location, and network operator imposed Quality ofService (QoS) profiles. The deterministic nature of the bandwidth allocationalgorithm allows for a very rapid distribution of burst time plans to theremotesin a network  8 times per second by default.  This type of deterministicarchitecture allows the system to take advantage of the statistical nature ofdynamic TCP/IP traffic demands, creating efficient transport of data traffic.For downstream, the iDirect systems uses Digital Video Broadcasting- SatelliteSecond Generation/Adaptive Code Modulation (DVB-S2/ACM) which provides amuch higher IP data rate (149 Mbps maximum).The D-TDMA protocol's rapid allocation of bandwidth provides for superiorperformance of real-time applications and the ability to deploy applicationspecific QoS.  Application specific QoS provides prioritization and bandwidthguarantees to different types of traffic per remote. For example, one canprioritize VoIP traffic over HTTP traffic or prioritize video traffic over filetransfers. Bandwidth allocation and prioritization can be triggered bySource/Destination IP, Source/Destination subnet, Source/Destination Port,DiffeServ/TOS bits, VLAN ID and/or by protocol type.  The Hub router polls theremote terminals 8 times per second to determine transmission requirementsand dynamically assigns transmission time slots based on transmissionrequirements.The Hub router is capable of handling multiple (20 or more) two-waycommunications channels from up to five different satellites simultaneously.The Hub Router System has been optimized to handle Transmission ControlProtocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic over satellite links and is neededforthe burst communications traffic patterns normally found in hub-spokecommunications networks.  The Hub router also has automatic in-route powercontrol that ensures that the Quality of Service (QoS) over the satellite linksremains constant even through severe weather conditions.  This technologyprovides more efficient use of satellite bandwidth by allowing multiple unitstouse a single channel.  The data packets are also much longer (1500 bytes)than that used by other protocols which allows a much higher throughput andgreater bandwidth efficiency (98%).  This allows the Government to providebetter SATCOM services within its bandwidth resources.In addition, the specified satellite communications components must alsointerface and be configurable with existing iDirect hub systems.  No systemsother than those manufactured by iDirect are fully compatible and configurablewith the Hub Routers and iDirect modems.  The current solicitation is intendedto support at least four separate existing satellite networks currently usingiDirect technology (three DoD networks and one non-DoD network).  In additionto the twelve hub systems involved, there are well over 2,000 remote terminalsconnected to these networks with embedded iDirect modems.  All of thesesystems are TRANSEC and FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified.  To replace thesesystems with another modem would require replacement of all of the Hubsystems, replacement of the modems in existing terminals, and all systemswould then have to be recertified and receive Approval to Operate (ATO) on theGlobal Information Grid (GIG).  Further, all previously developed trainingcourses for field operation/maintenance would have to be modified,configuration control established for the new systems, previously developeddocumentation would have to be modified, and new spares ordered.  The latestversions of the iDirect modems meet all TRANSEC and FIPS 140-2requirements and use DVB-S2/ACM and TDMA modes.  While some older linecards have been replaced, the basic iDirect hubs are still functional and canbeupgraded as required, instead of replaced, to meet DoD communicationsrequirements.  The cost to replace these items plus the "downtime" required tocarry out this transformation would be significant.The Government is soliciting this requirement with brand name descriptions dueto the unique capabilities of the iDirect products and to ensure compatibilitywith the existing systems.This is not a solicitation announcement. The projected timeframe for issuanceof the Request for Proposal is 2Q FY 2012. This synopsis is for informationaland planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid orproposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds theGovernment to solicit for or award a competitive contract. Unless otherwisestated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formalRequest for Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement iscurrently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. If asolicitationis released it will be found on the FEDBIZOPS and the SPAWAR E- COMMERCEwebpage: https://e-commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil. It is the potential offeror'sresponsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation.It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic'secommerce website for the release of the RFP and amendments (if any). Firmsare encouraged to review the web site regularly for updated information.

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotion of improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of synthesis and dissemination of available scientific evidence, including dissemination research and analytic methods or systems for rating the strength of scientific evidence. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research on existing as well as innovating technologies, and conducts research on methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality. AHRQ also recognizes that a number of populations experience persistent disparities in health status, access to care, quality of care, and poor health outcomes. To address these disparities, AHRQ encourages research projects to include special populations such as low-income groups, racial and ethnic minority groups, women, children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities and chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) which are the cornerstone of the Effective Health Care Program (EHC). The EPCs were created in 1997 to synthesize existing scientific literature about important health care topics and promote evidence-based practice and decision-making. Additional information on the EHC program in general, resources it provides, and descriptions of processes can be found at: http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/what-is-the-effective-health-care-program1/. Information on each of the component parts of the EHC Program can be found at: http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/who-is-involved-in-the-effective-health-care-program1/ Examples of products produced by each of the component parts of the Effective Health Care Program may be found at: http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/.</p>
<p>These reviews use the research methodology of systematic review to systematically and critically appraise existing research and synthesize knowledge on a particular topic. These are systematic reviews based on rigorous, comprehensive methods, emphasizing explicitly detailed documentation of methods rationale and assumptions. Respondents must provide, as part of their responses, information concerning their capability to respond to this requirement on a large scale basis. Through the EHC program, the EPCs will continue to work with a variety of partners such as guideline development groups, patients, providers, policy-makers and other consumers of evidence reports, including researchers and funders of research within given areas of concentration to identify, develop, refine questions for systematic review, synthesize evidence, and identify future research needs. It is anticipated that within the EHC Program, the EPCs will continue to work with stakeholders to synthesize evidence relating to their questions across the priority conditions and cross-cut areas listed below:<br />Table 1: EHC Program priority conditions and cross-cut areas</p>
<p>1. Arthritis and nontraumatic joint disorders<br />2. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder <br />3. Cancer<br />4. Cardiovascular disease, including stroke and hypertension<br />5. Dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease <br />6. Depression, other mental health disorders<br />7. Developmental delays, autism<br />8. Diabetes mellitus<br />9. Functional limitations and disability<br />10. Infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS<br />11. Obesity<br />12. Peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia<br />13. Pregnancy, including preterm birth<br />14. Pulmonary disease/asthma<br />15. Substance abuse<br />16. Cross-cut theme 1<br />a. Care delivery, management, and coordination<br />b. Prevention<br />17. Cross-cut theme 2<br />a. Medical testing<br />b. Imaging technologies<br />c. Medical and assistive devices</p>
<p>It is anticipated that multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts will be established. The Contractor shall function in a supportive technical role carrying out specific tasks, and shall not engage in independent research as part of this contract.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of EPC work is to present the "state of the science" on a given topic in a manner that can be directly applied to decisions made by users of health care information. These users include clinicians, patients, policy-makers, and payers, and may be individuals or their related organizations. Specifically, evidence reports and technology assessments have been used as a scientific foundation for development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines, clinical pathways, review criteria, performance measures, and other clinical quality improvements tools, individual treatment decisions, coverage or reimbursement policies, and to develop research agendas. <br />With funding from a variety of sources, each with a different program goal, EPCs work with various partners and stakeholders to review a variety of health care delivery and clinical areas of focus. Clinical areas may focus on traditional therapeutics as well as complementary, alternative, nutritional, and other emerging areas such as genomics and may span from preventative services to implementation of medical devices.</p>
<p>The EPCs will implement a collective mission to meet the following objectives:<br />&bull; Promote the synthesis and translation of evidence within given topic areas.<br />&bull; Engage stakeholders to identify and refine questions in which systematic review will help disseminate and translate research findings for the stakeholder audience. <br />&bull; Conduct comparative effectiveness reviews (CERs), technical briefs, and updates of reviews with systematic and transparent methods.<br />&bull; Engage stakeholders to identify and characterize Future research needs to inform real-world healthcare decisions.<br />&bull; Collaborate with partners, including other EPCs and AHRQ programs, to promote relevant, consistent, transparent and valuable implementation of the systematic review process, dissemination of findings from systematic reviews and methodology projects, and the EPC Program as a whole.<br />&bull; Improve validity and utility of systematic reviews for decision-making<br />o Advance methods of systematic review through empiric methods research<br />o Ensure quality of EPC reviews through associate editor and peer review.<br />&bull; Improve consistency and cohesiveness of program<br />o Develop methods guidance and translation of methods guidance to aid implementation efforts<br />&#61607; CERs and systematic reviews<br />&#61607; Reviews of medical tests<br />&#61607; Identification of Future research needs<br />&#61607; Topic identification<br />o Development of tools to improve EPC program efficiency</p>

<DESC><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</span></strong> <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes issued by the C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The United States Air Force (USAF) is requesting information for a Channel Switch Guard solution and/or modification to the Trail/Rewind Switch on the KC-135R Multi-Point Refueling System (MPRS) Equipped Aircraft.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE:<br /></span></strong>The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (GKC/GKCK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of an Channel Switch Guard solution and/or modification to the Trail/Rewind switch on the Lightplate of a MPRS equipped KC-135R airplane.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br /></span></strong>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a response to an RFI, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>The Government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. However, should proprietary information be submitted, it should be marked "PROPRIETARY", and will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION:<br /></span></strong>The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic missions. Joint Operations with U.S. services and NATO countries require the United States Air Force to provide aerial refueling operations that require Airmen (aka "Boomers") to manually operate switching mechanisms on a MPRS Pod Control Panel. (See Figures 1-4 within the attached). The Airmen are unintentionally and inadvertently engaging the Trail/Rewind Switch into the "trail" position without the fuel and air pump activated. This action causes the empty, unstable hose and drogue to violently unwind and rip off the MPRS Pod and aircraft. (See Figure 5 for further description of this issue).</p>
<p><br />This RFI is for the estimated cost of installing and delivering a Channel Switch Guard solution and/or modification to the Trail/Rewind switch (2 switches per control panel) on the Lightplate of a Flight Refueling LTD Pod Control Panel. (NSN # 1680992157709). A total of 38 Pod Control Panels will be modified. (total of 76 switch guards). The switch guard must not be glued to the Lightplate. Reinstallation of the Lightplate will require the use of a Torque Wrench or equal precautions to prevent its breakage. The Lightplate has fine electrical wires throughout it. Note: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has proprietary rights of any and all drawings of the Pod Control Panel. Therefore, no drawings will be provided within this RFI. However, photographs are referenced within the attachments. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE:<br /></span></strong><br />Responses shall address:</p>
<p>1. Installation parameters include a clear description of installation and response drawing/drawings.<br />2. For planning purposes please provide all cost estimates in American currency. Please include a break out of labor hours and material costs. For non U.S. interested parties - please include the currency exchange rate and the date of that exchange rate next to your quoted price in American currency. <br />3. The 38 Control Panels will be shipped for modification at the rate of up to 4 Control Panels at a time. The delivery should encompass the time from arrival of the control panels arrive at your facility/facilities to when they leave you or your sub-contractor facility/facilities, do not include transit or time in customs. For simplicity, please quote your delivery time for 4 control panels. <br />4. The switch guard must satisfy all US Air Force airworthiness and safety requirements and be suitable for the USA Air Force's Foreign Military Sales programs. The switch guard must allow the switch to be operated with flight gloved hands.<br />5. All supplier shipments to be made FOB destination.<br />6. Interested parties shall comply with USA ITAR regulations.<br />7. Mil Spec packaging should be considered. Include this request as a separate cost.<br />8. The USA Air Force would prefer the installation of the switch guard within the USA provided that the total program cost is reduced and delivery times are not increased.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;Additionally, please note the following as you consider your response:</span></p>
<p>Services are to include research and development, technology insertions, system integrations, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support, logistic support services, and engineering support. Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrade and operational support costs.</p>
<p>The information you provide may be used by the USAF to consider planning, program phasing and tailored technical requirements. Your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any manner. Although the identification of contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information that is received as a result of this RFI. Your participation in the RFI will not affect your company's position during any solicitation, nor will this RFI be used as criteria for the prequalification of respondents for future solicitations.</p>
<p>Through this RFI the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or emerging technologies which meet the requirements. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the responses received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This RFI is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any response preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Responders should be aware and are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.</p>

<DESC>Request For Information (RFI)<br />RFI-NASS-002-2012
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201 (e). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract. The RFI is issued solely to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to the RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Furthermore, the BOP will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>The RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Responders to this RFI are advised that the BOP will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if any is issued.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The BOP is seeking information relating to the procurement of a multi-site, enterprise salary projection program. The salary projection program would be comprised of hardware, software, technical support and maintenance to support over 125 institutions, 6 regional offices, 2 training centers, and the headquarters. The program must accomplish electronic data feeds from the National Finance Center (NFC) payroll databases, the BOP's Financial Management Information System (FMIS) budgeting and accounting databases, and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) pay scales. The program must support 500 concurrent users and 50,000 authorized positions. The program must provide fiscal year salary expenses and projections by individual site, as well as, summaries by region and a headquarter roll-up. The application should be user friendly, providing point-n-click or drop-down menus as much as possible. Database server hardware would be utilized by all BOP facilities; have backup failover capabilities; and contain a test environment for troubleshooting and new test/process development.</p>
<p>Salary projections are currently being accomplished by each BOP individual location (using a variety of methods); however, there is not a consistent program being utilized. Therefore, Central or Regional Offices cannot review salary projection data timely or using an automated format. Currently, there is no method to verify the accuracy of the projections.</p>
<p>The salary projection program would have the capability for a maximum of approximately 500 users to simultaneously access the system with no loss of normal operational response time. The salary projection program would also have the capability to process and store salary data for an annual volume of over 50,000 employees at 125 sites for up to 27 bi-weekly pay periods each fiscal year with no loss of normal operational response time.</p>

Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment<br>opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621111 with a size standard of $10.0 million (USD).  

Interested parties responding to this notice MUST be capable of providing physicians that are Board Certified/Board Eligible in Emergency Medicine or Internal Medicine, and fully licensed to practice in any state in the United States.  The Contractor will provide physician coverage to sustain the current volume of approximately 25,000 patients in the E.D. annually, where 80% of those patients are seen between 9am to 9pm and are designated at ESI levels 3-5.  Reference the following site for information on ESI levels: http://www.ahrq.gov/research/esi/esihandbk.pdf.  The E.D. operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

<a href="mailto:athena.donatiello.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Adelphi</a>
<DESC>Military applications of biometric exploitation to date have largely focused on the use of fingerprints to identify personnel for entry into controlled areas. Biometrics has an expanded role in military operations such as combat identification (friend, foe, or neutral), offensive operations (intelligence support to targeting), force protection (base access), detention operations, civil-military operations (track target members of a population), and personnel recovery and identification. Other potential applications include Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) and Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR). In addition, biometrics can be utilized to improve business functions such as physical and logical access controls and privilege management applications like health care benefits, finance, and time reporting.<br><br>As biometrics matures within the Department of Defense (DoD), the requirements and needs of the user are becoming increasingly complex and require specific solutions that have not yet been developed. It is DoD's intent to advance the state-of-the-art across the spectrum of the biometrics infrastructure to provide users with new and enhanced biometrics capabilities. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), on behalf of the DoD's Biometrics Identity Management Agency (BIMA) and the Defense Biometrics and Forensics Office, is soliciting proposals focused on the development and demonstration of biometric functionality across the Focus Areas indicated below. An accepted proposal should lead to a tangible demonstration in no less than 12 months. Demonstrations and assessments will be performed in coordination with BIMA. Results are to include technical performance measurements and analysis from actual test beds and laboratory environments that indicate the effectiveness of the technology to advance the state-of-the-art in current biometrics capabilities across and/or within these Focus Areas:<br><br>a. Rapid Verification for Physical Access: DoD is interested in innovative biometric technologies and integrated systems for controlling physical access to a military facility.  DoD currently relies on guard personnel to visually verify pre-screened individuals seeking access to DoD facilities.  There is a requirement to explore the use of automated biometric technology to positively identify individuals in a vehicle that are authorized access to the facility, providing a reduction in the number of personnel required to operate access points, increase in the quality of the verification process, and maintain or improve throughput.  DoD is interested in technology that facilitates rapid capture and verification of all individuals in a vehicle.  The implementation should be able to automatically determine the number of individuals, up to four per vehicle, and then biometrically verify the identities of occupants.<br><br>b. Fingerprint Card Scanner Capability: The DoD participates in data sharing and building partner nation capability with a number of international partners.  Many of these nations use paper-based fingerprint cards that must be digitized for storage and automated matching.  DoD is seeking innovative technologies that can quickly and accurately process the wide variety of paper-based fingerprint cards, extract both the biometric and biographical information, and populate a transmission file that meets the DoD transmission specification (DoD Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS 2.0)) and is seamlessly ingestible into the DoD Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS).  Solutions should be capable of extracting biographical data that is typed, script, or block printed, and not rely on storing graphical images of these fields. <br><br><br>c. Biometrics in support of enduring DoD missions and strategies.  Previous technology focus areas have concentrated on fundamental improvements to sensors and data processing techniques, designed to improve data collection or to provide immediate Warfighter support.  However, DoD is also interested in biometric technologies and integrated systems that support non combat, enduring DoD missions such as HA/DR or NEO.  For example, submitters might develop a system that enables improved speed and efficiency of the distribution of disaster relief supplies; or a low-cost system that could be used at an international refugee camp to prevent unauthorized access of militia or criminal elements.  The technical approach should consider the cost of implementing the proposed solution; for example, if the technical approach requires issuance of an expensive credential to every refugee, the overall implementation cost may make the system infeasible.  Other missions and strategies include Force Protection, Counterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterinsurgency, <br><br>d. Novel Technologies and uses for Biometrics:  DoD is interested in new and novel technologies to provide improved collect and match capabilities to our warfighters.  Examples include better approaches to rapid and accurate biometric collection, verification, and identification of an individual; technology that provides quality metrics on data collected; fusion of both traditional and "soft" biometrics to enable better verification or identification with a small data set; improved extraction of biometrics from low quality video; and improvements to understanding and measuring the fundamental science relevant to DoD's use of biometrics. DoD is also interested in innovative ways to use new or existing biometric technology to reduce costs and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DoD functions.<br><br><br>DoD is interested in fostering a rapid technology development cycle in these areas, so projects that progress quickly to demonstration are preferred.  Projects should have a period of performance of no more than 9-12 months and a budget of no more than $750,000.  Technical approaches are expected to employ modular open architectures.  When proprietary techniques must be used as part of a system, the original data must remain intact and useable by the DoD biometric enterprise without further interaction with the offeror. <br><br>While Topic 2.63 will remain open throughout the period covered by BAA W911NF-07-R-0001-05, funding is currently available under this topic for up to seven procurement contract awards.  The funding level for these awards is not anticipated to exceed $750,000/year per award.  <br><br>To be considered for this year's funding, white papers in accordance with PART III, SECTIONS 3-4 of the ARL BAA must be received by 12:00pm (Eastern Standard Time) 13 January 2012.  Each white paper must be submitted with a single PowerPoint chart, in landscape mode, divided into four equal quadrants. The upper left quadrant shall contain a graphic representing the approach or product described in the white paper.  The upper right quadrant shall contain a brief description of the approach and the expected product described in the white paper.  The lower left quadrant shall contain a schedule of major milestones for the proposed effort as described in the White Paper.  The lower right quadrant shall contain estimated proposed cost for each major milestone as described in the white paper.  Use no smaller than 18 point Arial font.  This chart will not count against the white paper page count.<br><br>In approximately 3 weeks after receipt of white papers, offerors submitting proposals of interest to ARL will receive an invitation to submit a complete proposal in accordance with PART III, SECTIONS 5-6 of the ARL BAA.  Complete proposals will be due approximately 4 weeks from issuance of the invitation letter.<br><br>Point of Contact<br>Dr. Keith Aliberti, keith.m.aliberti.civ@mail.mil, (301)-394-2320<br><br>

<a href="mailto:carolyn.f.truxal.civ@mail.mil">MICC - White Sands Missile Range</a>
<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to extend an existing contract on a sole source basis to Canon U.S.A., 2110 Washington Boulevard Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22204-5710, for the Copier Maintenance Services contract at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The proposed contract action will extend the performance period of Contract W9124Q-06-F-1307 by six months under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Estimated dollar value of this action is $161,491.80, for the period of performance: 1 April 2012 - 30 September 2012. The Government's intent is to extend the current services with Canon in order for White Sands Missile Range to continue using the copiers until the centralization of copier services can begin via an enterprise-wide contract to be awarded by the 7th Signal Command which is expected to be in place by late summer 2012. Since the copiers remain on the installation and must be removed within the next six months there is no possibility that other contractors can meet the current requirement for use of these copiers until their removal. Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to: Carolyn.f.truxal.civ@mail.mil, no later than 7 January 2012 at 1200 MST. Comments submitted for consideration of other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 532420. There is no associated small business size standard.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service awarded Purchase Order EE133E-12-SE-0375 as a firm fixed price in the amount of $12,000.00 to provide mission critical patches specifically Product Aletrt 40 (year 2012 issue)&nbsp;for its Quantum archive system StorNext 2.6.5.&nbsp; It is the Government's intent to&nbsp;negotiate as sole source with Quantum Corporation, Dallas, Texas in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 Other Than Full and Open Competition, Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The effective performance period is December 1, 2011 through January 15, 2012.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 334112 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. The purpose of this notification is to provide notification that due to an error in the pricing the actual award amount would be increased above threshold required for posting of requirements. The award amount is being increased by $2,500.00 to $14,500.00 as a firm fixed price. In addition to the above, the Government has made a decision to provide an option for an option for a systems engineer at a proposed $200 per hour with the Government established maximum of 80 hours which would provide a life cycle value of $30,500.00.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not in the best interest of the government to compete this task as Quantum is the only contractor that can perform the work for the least cost and provides the best value to the government, considering that selecting another contractor would delay work and would require significant delays with mission critical data becoming unavailable until a solution is provided and remediation of the system vulnerabilities is addressed.</p>

<p>DUE: 30 JAN 2012</p>
<p>POC: Ms. Maureen Bernard, Procuring Contracting Officer</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AS A MARKET SURVEY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>I. SUMMARY</p>
<p>PEO(U&amp;W) PMA-281 is seeking industry input in the form of comments and products that will inform future development efforts to address commonality in Control Systems (CS) for unmanned vehicles. PMA-281's intent is to field CCS software that will support PEO(U&amp;W) developmental and existing Unmanned Air Systems (UAS). PMA-281 therefore is providing information and products for industry review in order to better apprise industry of our intended acquisition and technical approach. PMA-281 will utilize products provided by industry to support our near-term CCS Risk Reduction efforts that will inform specific architectural approaches, integration documentation and products, and overall understanding of industry approaches to open service oriented software development. This review will provide the Government an overall understanding of industry approaches to open service oriented architecture software development and will inform, and may be utilized in, the near-term risk reduction efforts. This RFI will initiate an open dialogue between PMA-281 and industry. PMA-281 will establish a secure web accessible site for Government and industry respondents to share information during the course of this dialogue. This site will be used to inform RFI respondents of updates to CCS artifacts and plans.</p>
<p><br />II. CONSTRAINTS</p>
<p>Industry should be aware that the government intent is to use all information gathered and learned through this RFI to better inform the community as a whole. The submission of industry proprietary information and products is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED, and will limit the government's ability to utilize such information and products. As PMA-281 releases information based on interactions with specific industry comments/products, it will protect the identity of the specific company/products, but the generalized information gathered from the review and use of industry products may be made equally available to all respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>III. RFI INITIAL RELEASE CONTENTS</p>
<p>1. Updated PMA-281 CCS Overview (Enclosure 1). This overview is provided to give industry insight into the CCS Concept, the current acquisition strategy, the products released with this RFI and expected future products, the existing Risk Reduction efforts ongoing, and the planned next phase of Risk Reduction efforts.</p>
<p>2. DRAFT CCS Software Performance Specification (Enclosure 2). This is the top level performance specification describing the intended functionality and requirements of the software. The document is provided in draft form, and work is ongoing to resolve outstanding comments and align with the 2.1 version of the UCS Architecture.</p>
<p>3. DRAFT CCS Software COTS Framework (Enclosure 3). This document is currently established as the list of COTS products base-lined in the CCS Risk Reduction prototype (efforts described in the CCS Overview brief provided herein). This is the baseline Framework that is anticipated to be used in a later production version of CCS.</p>
<p>4. CCS Middleware Suitability Analysis (Enclosure 4). This report is to provide Industry insight into the existing Government analysis on the COTS Framework. The Navy is continuing to revise and update this analysis.</p>
<p>5. UAS Control Segment (UCS) Architecture. PMA-281 fully intends to have CCS align with the UCS Architecture. This architecture is being developed under direction from the OSD/AT&amp;L UAS Task Force by the UCS Working Group (an Industry consortium). It is understood this is an evolving architecture. The public website, as well as the site open to industry participants, is listed below. For respondents not currently associated with the organization, the contact page on the public site provides information on participation.</p>
<p>Public website for industry:<br />http://www.ucsarchitecture.org/page/participant</p>
<p>Controlled website for UCS members:<br />https://fusion.dynetics.com/project/UCSWG/default.aspx</p>
<p>6. Reference to Open Business Model (OBM). PMA-281 fully intends to procure all developmental CCS products in accordance with the OBM. Open business model is available through the controlled UCS portal (see item 5 above), under the Reference Library section.</p>
<p>7. Request for software products and supporting documentation. PMA-281 intends to take industry software products and integrate them into its CCS Risk Reduction activities as described in the PMA-281 CCS Overview (Enclosure 1). Intent of this section of the RFI is to allow for industry to provide to the government the non-proprietary software products and supporting documentation/tools they have developed for Unmanned Control Systems. The goal of this effort is to better inform both industry and the government on the state of Open Service Oriented Software Development as it related to UAS Control Systems. PMA-281 does not intend to purchase, or in any other way reimburse, respondents for provided products or information. Use of products provided will be limited to support of the activities described herein and will not be further distributed or used outside this effort.</p>
<p>IV. CONTENT FOR INITIAL RFI RESPONSE</p>
<p>As stated, the intent of this RFI is to establish an open dialogue with industry. With each release of information, PMA-281 will establish guidelines for the content and timeline allowed for responses. For this release of information, the government is looking for general comments on items 1-6, as listed in Section III of this document, conforming to the page limitations and due dates in Section V of this document. Specific instructions per item are listed below. The Government will not accept responses that do not follow these guidelines.</p>
<p>1. PMA-281 is seeking comments on the CCS concept and acquisition strategy as described in the overview. The Government is also providing clarification on the current risk reduction activities, and future activities as pertains to the request for industry products (as listed in item 7, Section III of this document). The Government encourages industry comments on these activities, especially with regards to how these activities might be improved to increase alignment with industry.</p>
<p>2. Comments on the CCS Software Performance Specification should be general in nature and not be in regard to each individual requirement in the specification, (as there are over 1,000) but directed to the overall content, organization, and intent of the document.</p>
<p>3. The CCS COTS Framework. PMA-281 requests industry comments on the exact COTS products the Navy is currently using on the CCS software prototype. PMA-281 requests industry provide feedback and comparisons to existing comparable Frameworks in their own products; information regarding compatibility of the CCS Framework with existing Industry products; comments on the suitability of the <br />listed products, recommendations for modified or additional products, and supporting rationale for those recommendations.</p>
<p>4. The CCS Middleware Suitability Analysis. PMA-281 welcomes industry comments on this analysis.</p>
<p>5. UAS Control Segment (UCS) Architecture. PMA-281 would like to solicit industry comments in regards to the adoption of the architecture for CCS and industry's current approach to building conformant products</p>
<p>6. Reference to Open Business Model (OBM). Industry is invited to provide feedback to the approach.</p>
<p>7. PMA-281 requests that industry provide non-proprietary software products, associated documentation and tools, and any needed simulation/stimulation products that respondents would like to provide to PMA-281 in support of its ongoing CCS risk reduction activities. For software products identified, respondents should provide supporting summary information regarding the underlying architecture, whether corresponding source code is provided, what level of support documentation, tools, and simulation/drivers are being provided to assist in the risk reduction goals of integrating products into a Government prototype. For every product listed, respondents should indicate any associated restrictions with its use, such as proprietary disclosures, as the Government does not intend to utilize proprietary products during the risk reduction activity. Respondents should be aware that feedback from the use of respondents' products is intended to be provided back to industry as a whole in order to better inform the community. PMA-281 will protect the identity of the specific company/products, but the generalized information gathered from the review and use of industry products may be made equally available to all respondents to this RFI. Respondents should provide any additional information regarding products that are leveraged from past or existing DoD programs or commercial products.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase Order for Chemical Market Encyclopedias
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order to IHS Global, Inc. (also doing business as SRI Consulting) for the 2012 edition of two chemical market encyclopedias, the Chemical Economics Handbook and the Specialty Chemicals Update Program.  These two encyclopedias provide a unique compilation of information on the chemical industry and on chemical applications necessary to support EPA?s Economic and Policy Analysis Branch analyses.  SRI Consulting is the only source that provides this type of chemical market encyclopedia.  Single volume synopses of the chemical industry lack the breadth, depth of information and insight that these two encyclopedias contain.
The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b)(1).  Efforts to acquire similar supplies, and/or develop alternate sources for this requirement would result in significant additional costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all proposals received within five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive proc urement.

<p>&bull; Facilities Management(FM): manages the agency's personal and real property, building operations, space design and layout, realty, safety and occupational health programs, as well as support services programs that promote a safe, healthy, and high-quality work environment for OPM employees.</p>
<p>&bull; Emergency Actions (EA): directs the operations and oversight of OPM's preparedness and emergency response programs, including the Continuity of Operations Program (COOP), Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP), and Continuity of Government (COG) programs.

<DESC>NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take several months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

NOTE:  Please note that Schedule 36 is accepting offers for SIN 51-507, Destruction Services. 

Please note that SIN 51-508, Litigation Support Service is revised to include paralegal support and eDiscovery requirements.

Please note that there is a new Special Item Number (SIN) under Schedule 36.  If your company offers these services, we encourage the addition of this SIN to your contract.  The description for SIN 51-500 - Managed Print Services is as follows:

SIN 51-500 Managed Print Services
Managed Print Services (MPS) includes equipment and services required to manage imaging output that may include printing, scanning, copying, and fax devices in a system that monitors and reports status, needs and usage trends on regular basis.   The MPS plan may be based on a needs analysis completed under SIN 51-501.  Services may include but are not limited to creating a business plan solution that incorporates recommendations for each existing piece of equipment (including removing/retirement/recycling/disposal). The plan may be phased to allow for an orderly progression to the new output environment. The plan should take into account the usage and floor plan of the equipment.
Maximum Order $1,000,000, Estimated Sales $3,500,000, Not Set Aside

Additionally, the SIN description for SIN 51-501 - Needs Assessment and Analysis Services has been updated.

The SIN descriptions for SINs 51-55 - Rental Plan for Copiers, 51-58 - Lease to Ownership Plans (LTOP) Copiers, 51-58A - Operating Lease Plan for Copiers, 51-100 - Copiers, 51-100C - Cost-per-Copy Plan for Copiers, and 51-100F - Flat Rate Monthly Fee  Copying Plan for Copiers have been updated to include Energy Star requirements.

NOTE:  Effective April 1, 2010, the Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (IWACenter), Schedule 36 will only accept proposals submitted electronically through the eOffer/eMod system.  The eOffer/eMod system is a web based application that allows contractors to electronically prepare and submit proposals.

For information on how to obtain digital certificates per DUNs number, please see the following link:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov/eoffer_docs/compliCert.html

The evaluation of quotes shall be based on the quoters responsiveness to the items listed, quoters price proposal, and the quoters ability to exhibit an understanding of the requirements included in this RFQ and the following technical evaluation factors. MINIMUM TECHNICAL FACTORS (GO-NO GO): 1) Quoter shall provide evidence that it is an approved Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce Designated Analysis Center covering all aircraft in the statement of work; 2) Quoter shall provide evidence of having the ability to perform consistent ECTM and show evidence that its personnel have successfully completed an Engine Condition Trend Monitoring Internet-based course or have demonstrated more than one (1) year of experience using the internet-based ECTM services application in conjunction with trend analysis. 3) Quoter shall provide ECTM data sheets for aircrew use in the recording and submittal of recorded data to the DAC, and a means from which aircrew may submit data (fax and on-line) to the DAC on a reoccurring basis while aircraft are deployed. Contractors shall first meet the above minimum technical factors and then will be evaluated on the technical factors. TECHNICAL FACTORS: 1) Past performance. References (no more than 3) from contracts of a similar scope that shows evidence of quoter's ability to accomplish the required service. Provide number of accounts, relevancy of work, and recency of work and related experience to include phone numbers and points of contact which demonstrates quoter has performed ECTM service for the aircraft and engines in the SOW.

The Government will award the contract to the contractor that is the best value for the work in a manageable location. This may include price, time availability for services required, and other technical factors. All responsible quoters may submit a response to this notice that will be considered by the agency.</p>

Justification for "Brand Name": At the time of Tram system construction, a problem developed with stretching of the tram cables.  The Tram system is unique and not like any other transportation system.  In many respects the system compares to an elevator system, and in many respects it is more nearly like a railroad train system.  In a conventional elevator system, the hoisting cable essentially suspends the car vertically from a single traction sheave.  In the Arch Tram system, the equipment runs on wheels within a track layout, at varying angles from the vertical, including nearly horizontal at the bottom.  The hoisting ropes pass over the traction sheave and 43 intermediate sheaves, and are bent in both directions.
The stretching problem of the cables was solved by the development by Bethlehem Steel Corp., (jointly with Planet Corporation and Montgomery Elevator, fabricators and installers of the Tram,) of a manufacturing process that prestresses the ropes to 50% of their breaking strength during fabrication.  This process was and remains an industrial trade secret of Williamsport Wire Rope, the successor of the Wire Rope Division of Bethlehem Steel, and they, to the exclusion of all others, possess the machinery required.
In 1980, a substitute rope was purchased from another manufacturer, MacWhyte.  This rope met the written specifications of the Purchase with the exception of the required 50% prestress.  The performance of this rope was not satisfactory, and was in fact damaging to the sheaves.  It was required to shorten the ropes more than was normally required and to in fact replace the sheaves throughout the system due to increased rate of wear.  This was concluded to be due to the fact that the MacWhyte rope was much stiffer than the Bethlehem rope, and did not bend well enough around the sheaves to preclude sliding.  MacWhyte did not dispute these findings.It is not physically possible by testing or examination to determine whether a given rope was manufactured with the required 50% prestress or not (this conclusion is from Consultants Sverdrup and Parcel, and St. Louis Testing, who jointly investigated the sheave failures for the BiState Development Agency.).The above information, accepted as proprietary product by the National Park Service in 1982 (Finding and Determination, by Contracting) and by BiState Development Agency in 1988/1989, when they performed this procurement, and remains applicable.
In the instance that the non-conforming ropes were installed, the rope sheaves were damaged so severely that they required replacement.  Replacing sheaves requires several months for ordering, manufacture, and installation.  There are hoist rope sheaves, compensating rope sheaves, and governor rope sheaves. Hoist rope sheaves, for example, are machined cast iron, with nine grooves for the ropes, each sheave weighing about 200 pounds.  Moving them into place in the leg of the Arch is labor-intensive and difficult, requiring rigging from beams and columns with ropes and pulleys.  Production of the sheaves from shop drawings by a foundry is estimated to take at least 120 days.
The National Park Service intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order based on the responses to this combined Synopsis / Solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and 6 Competition Requirements.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation that will be issued for this requirement.
Any Questions regarding this Combined Synopsis / Solicitation must be submitted in writing to Kathleen Batke, Contract Specialist at (770) 880-3099 or e-mail:  kathleen_batke@nps.gov.
Quoted are due by December 15, 2011 -  3:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  Quotes are required to be completed on company letterhead and e-mailed to kathleen_batke@nps.gov

Prior to delivery to the contractor, NAWCADLKE will perform a post weld stress relief of 1100 degrees F for no less than 4-hours on each weldment.<br />The scope of work will be identical to that which was accomplished during Proof of Principle process development on Reference (c). Soak time and temperatures will be based on a weldment that is constructed from AISI 4340 alloy steel with varying cross section thicknesses (see Reference a), weighs 300 lbs and has a 49-inch overall length. The heat treatment process shall consist of a salt bath austenitization with hot salt bath marquench accomplished in accordance with Reference (b) with the following execeptions and supplementation:<br />1. Normalize (vacuum atmosphere);<br />2. Sub-critical anneal (vacuum atmosphere);<br />3. Salt bath austenitizing phase to include pre-heat and soak in multiple steps up to final temperature.<br />4. Hot salt bath marquench, minimum bath temperature to be 550 degree F;<br />5. Double temper (nitrogen atmosphere).<br />6. Targeted final hardness is ideal strength v r HRC 35/36 but the final acceptance range is as low as HRC 32.<br />Other Requirements for each production unit:<br />Contractor will visually examine the weldment between each heating cycle to the maximumextent practical to determine if any cracks have developed. Notify NAWCADLKE immediately if cracks have been observed.<br />Heating/cooling rates NTE 200 degree F/hour.<br />Oven charts for each heating cycle to be provided for each phase.<br />Provide results of decarb testing and map locations where testing is done.<br />Report hardness results and map locations where testing is done.<br />At the discretion of NAWCADLKE, an additional 8X10X2-inch thick 4340 coupon may be provided and will occupy same oven time and receive same Q&amp;T as NLG weldment.<br />The contractor will aluminum oxide grit blast the weldment and corrosion protect with Mil-PRF-18173 oil.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>There are a couple additional questions and responses pertaining to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Question 1 Is there a requirement for the spacing between the two openings of the enclosure? i.e. does it have to be of a particular length?</p>
<p>Response 1 There is no requirement in the PD for the distance between the two openings. The farthest distance that the lab has used is four feet. We need a distance to spot size of 20:1 or better.</p>
<p><br />Question 2 If the second blackbody is a spare, are you looking for complete spare blackbody system (blackbody head and controller)? Or just a spare blackbody head?</p>
<p>Response 2 The spare blackbody should have its own controller.</p>

Reference GPO publication 310.1 for attribute requirements. Printing is the predominate production function and none shall be subcontracted. All contractors submitting a quotation shall have passed the NCI Requirements for New Bidders prior to consideration of their quotation for award.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) requires audit remediation services for one year. This will result in a Requirement - Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract.&nbsp;This combined synopsis/solicitation is&nbsp;for commercial services in accordance with&nbsp;FAR 22.100&nbsp;Service Contract Act of<br />1965. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a best value source selection solicitation. The solicitation number is AG-3A75-S-12-0004 and is issued as a Request for Proposal. The solicitation document and incorporation provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-54. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Agriculture Acquisition Regulations (AGAR) clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation can be found in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.<br />This is a Total Small Business Set Aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 541211, with a business size standard of $8.5 Million. Task orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements. Firms will be evaluated based on the criteria listed in the Request for Proposal. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.&nbsp;<br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The Audit Remediation Services are being sought for one year. The minimum order amount is $225,800.00 and the maximum order amount is $4,000,000.00, with a contract ceiling of $7,000,000.00.<br />Pre-Qualification Criteria:<br />Proposals submitted will be reviewed to confirm that the offerors have at least three years experience in audit remediation and /or auditing shall be considered.<br />EVALUATION PROCEDURES: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />In order for the Government to complete an equitable, independent and accurate assessment of each proposal, offers must submit proposals conforming to the contractor qualifications described in the Statement of Work. Each proposal submitted will be reviewed before it is evaluated to confirm that the offer meets the pre-qualification criteria set forth above. If the offer does not meet the pre-qualification criteria by the time and date the proposals are due, the offeror could be disqualified. If the offeror meets the pre-qualification criteria, then the technical proposal will be evaluated on the basis of the evaluation factors listed below. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance with their relative evaluation values. Offerors will be ranked according to their scores to determine the competitive range of the most highly rated proposals, with the highest score representing the most highly technically qualified offeror. Business/price proposals of the offerors within the competitive range will then be evaluated to determine the offeror's responsibility and to determine if their proposed prices are realistic and reasonable. The Government may evaluate the price proposals without discussions, except for clarifications. Therefore, the offeror's initial price proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint.
<p>Proposals shall be submitted in two separate volumes/files: 1. A Technical Proposal which content and arrangement shall be as described in the provision entitles, "Instruction for Preparing the Technical Proposal". This will also address the source selection evaluation factors and 2. A Price Proposal which shall be prepared in detail on a basis as described and set forth in the provision entitled, "Instruction for Preparing the Price Proposal". Instructions for Preparing Technical Proposal: a) The technical proposal shall effectively demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW), Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and demonstrate the offerors ability to meet the project requirements and provide the deliverables described in the work statement.(b) Technical proposal should be practical, legible, clear and coherent. General statements that the offeror can comply with the requirements will not, by themselves, be adequate. Failure to provide the technical information requested may be reason for rejection of the offer. To permit objective evaluation of the technical proposal no cost or price information shall be included in the Technical Proposal. (c) Technical proposals shall also address at a minimum, the Best Value Source Selection Evaluation Factors as follows:<br />Factor 1: Experience in federal financial audit deficiency remediation. 40% This factor evaluates the Offeror's experience in resolving Federal financial audit deficiencies and its approach to this Statement of Work (SOW). The evaluation will consider the Offeror's explanation of audit remediation work performed and its demonstrated success of such efforts, including explanations of how its work contributed to or resolved the Federal entity's material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, control deficiencies, etc. This factor evaluates the Offeror's project management capabilities and its approach to resolve NRCS' audit identified issues: undelivered orders, revenue and unfilled customer orders, accruals, financial reporting, property, plant and equipment, general access and application controls and purchase and fleet card transactions. Additionally, this factor evaluates the Offeror's knowledge and experience surrounding implementing and enhancing agency A-123 programs. This factor evaluates the Offeror's knowledge of the legal and regulatory rules governing federal grants, agreements, and contracting processes. The evaluation will rate the contractor's previous experience in these areas and in applying the relevant rules and regulations. This factor evaluates the contractor's knowledge of Federal accounting standards (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and its experience in applying GAAP to ensure proper, compliant business processes. <br />Factor 2: Experience in developing and implementing standardized business practices. 30% <br />This factor evaluates the contractor's experience in developing and implementing efficient, cost effective standardized business processes that are compliant with Federal GAAP, statutes, rules and regulations. The evaluation will include a review of the contractor's previous experience in developing and implementing efficient standard business practices. Specific experience developing standardized business practices in a de-centralized environment will also be evaluated. <br />Factor 3: Staffing plan, mix, and expertise. 20% <br />This factor evaluates the proposed staffing plan, ensuring that proposed personnel are adequate to complete the job within the given timelines and proposed labor mix to accomplish the SOW. The review will consider the qualifications and experience of the individuals proposed and the likelihood that the contractor has or can provide necessary staffing levels. The evaluation will also consider the contractor's staffing strategy to address the audit remediation work in a cost efficient, effective manner.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Past Performance. 10%<br />This factor evaluates the Offeror's past performance which includes the offeror's demonstrated record of performance on recent/relevant efforts. Current contracts or subcontracts completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years from the issuance of solicitation will be considered RECENT. Contracts of similar size and complexity and have a logical connection with the work being acquired are considered RELEVANT. Relevant contracts represent much of the scope of the effort for a Government agency valued between $5M - $8M. Relevant contracts include providing strategies, quality control plans, monthly status reports and training.<br />Please complete the attached Contractor's Qualification and Financial Information Sheet.<br />Instruction for Preparing Price Proposal: (a) A lump sum shall be submitted by line item by each offeror for the required services. Pricing shall be included and provided for the one year base term. There are no option years. Pricing will be based on the objectives and deliverables in the SOW. (b) Offerors are hereby notified that even if other cost or pricing data are not initially requested in this solicitation, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request such data if it is later found necessary. (c) Travel for specified contract locations will be at the rate in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations. (d) Wages must be in accordance with the FAR 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees : This provision requires that offerors submit for evaluation a total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating unrealistically low professional employees compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award. (e) Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed to show an inherent lack of technical competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements. This may be grounds for the rejection of the proposal. (e) Task orders will be issued for this contract. (f) Place of Performance: USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Services, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250. The offeror's price proposal by line item is for evaluation purposes only.<br />Clin 0001.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened. For those Contractors who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not be</strong></span> traveling with someone who already has base access, please get the information requested in the Pre-Proposal Conference Announcement Packet (Guest Name, Drivers License #, State of Issue, and Date of Birth) to Samuel McDuffey, <a href="mailto:Samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil">samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil</a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2011</strong></span>.

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Air Mobility Command is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Part of the market research is to publish on FedBizOpps a Request for Information (RFI) seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services, as described in the tasks below. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Firms choosing to respond to this RFI are cautioned that THIS SYNOPSIS/RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This RFI is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a request for proposal. The Government is not obligated to and shall not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this synopsis and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non-federal government activities regarding the information you provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p><strong>2. Background/Scope</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force (AF) Air Mobility Command's (AMC) priority is to develop a comprehensive fitness model with a component designed to increase proactive coping, self-management and leadership skills to enhance individual resilience. Cultivating these skills in our Airmen will ensure that AMC maintain a cadre of balanced, healthy, self-confident Airmen whose physical, mental, spiritual and social fitness and resiliency enable them to effectively manage, and even experience personal and professional growth in response to stressors associated with military service, including a high operational tempo, deployments, recurrent change and the requirement to maintain high personal and professional standards of conduct. Military members face all of these challenges in addition to family, home and community responsibilities and stressors, which may be exacerbated by the rigors of military life. The current effort is intended to support and train individual Airmen in small groups to increase resilience across Air Mobility Command. Goals include:</p>
<p>- Supporting positive coping with challenge and adversity<br />- Reducing negative outcomes <br />- Accomplishing the Air Force global mission</p>
<p>AMC is seeking a program that could train Airmen in skills, attitudes and behaviors to promote individual resilience in conjunction with leadership skills to increase organizational resilience is the objective. Specifically, AMC would like targeted intensive, skills based, small group, experiential resilience training for Airmen, supervisors, middle managers, senior leaders and spouses to be provided by full time professional Resilience Trainers at our 12 AMC installations. The goal is to train 100% of our active duty and DOD civilian employees and a substantial proportion of military spouses. The intervention should be a state of the art, evidence based multimodal educational experience that can be customized to the needs of our target population, manualized for standardized implementation and deployed to Air Force bases within months. Outcomes related to current negative outcomes would be targeted, including: suicide events, alcohol related misconduct, disciplinary actions and family maltreatment. Standardized measures of resilience and related constructs would be employed to assess change in self-reported attitudes, skills and behaviors. Qualitative reports/personal accounts and participant satisfaction surveys would also be employed in assessing the overall value of the program</p>

PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
Two-Phase Design-Build - Hoover Dam Multi-Use Green Building (formerly synopsized as "Spillway House Rehabilitation")
Solicitation Number:  R11PS30004
The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to issue a solicitation for the Design-Build of a new multi-use facility at Hoover Dam.  
Project Description:  Reclamation has a requirement to deconstruct the existing Spillway house building and repurpose at the Central Warehouse; and to reuse the existing foundation for the design and build of a new multi-use facility.  The design and construction shall be to a level to attain a Silver Rating or better, in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  The building will be approximately 5,000 gross square feet and shall be of an architectural compatible with the historic district.  The building should complement the Hoover Dam Historic Landmark area and express the spirit and value of Hoover Dam, including the beauty and health of the natural environment.  It should connect people to the outdoors with natural light and views.  The building is located approximately 100 yards north of Hoover Dam, on the Nevada side and is situated on the west bank of Lake Mead.
A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $1M - $5M.
This requirement will be solicited using full and open competition.  There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures, FAR Part 15, and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.
The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33.5M.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about April 26, 2011, under Solicitation number R11PS30004.  Only the three highest qualified offerors selected after evaluation of the Phase I proposals will be invited to participate in Phase 2 of the solicitation.  
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about August 11, 2011 with an anticipated completion date of April 2012.   All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change.  No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.  
NOTE:The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.  It is therefore, the responsibility of all interested parties to periodically access the above FBO internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued and to ensure that they have the most current information.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same.  
In addition, offerors are required to have a current registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on CCR at http://www.ccr.gov.  Written questions may be submitted to Rosa M. G?mez at rgomez@usbr.gov or by fax at 702-293-8499.  Only written questions will be accepted and addressed.

<DESC>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small businesses, services-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses) having the capability to provide content for NIDA Notes and prepare for publication on a government web site. NIDA Notes is a publication produced by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  The goals of the publication are to report advances in the drug abuse field; improve the knowledge base among clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy makers; educate professionals who encounter drug abuse issues in the course of their work to understand the scientific principles of drug abuse, its prevention and treatment and inform the public about important new knowledge and NIDA actions and initiatives. The project is journalistic in nature, requiring basic knowledge and continuous monitoring of progress in drug abuse research and its subfields (including epidemiology, prevention, clinical treatment, health services and basic research) through both the published peer reviewed literature and the maintenance of contacts with NIDA staff and persons in the field.  NIDA Notes will be entirely an internet publication after December 2011. 

The main tasks include efficient execution of all content production steps including: topic generation and management of a topic identification and approval process prior to writing; researching, writing, editing articles; managing a review and clearance process for completed articles; provision of appropriate graphics to illustrate articles and enhance understanding and attractiveness; and delivery of completed article contents with metadata to NIDAs Webmaster for posting. The annual quantity of material produced and delivered shall include but not be limited to the following: 26 Research Findings; 5 NIDA Directors Columns, 26 Research-in-Brief-style items; 26 short (approx 200 words) Update items; 5 graphics-based features; a glossary of scientific terms used in NIDA Notes and a masthead page (see past NIDA Notes issues for examples of article types).  Content is to be delivered on a weekly basis to maintain the dynamism of the site. Plain language, accuracy, clarity, concision, and readability are the defining characteristics of the writing and graphics in NIDA Notes.

Other capabilities required for the project includes:

<DESC>AMENDED SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE BELOW: The original Sources Sought notice is hereby amended to remove special characters the Fedbizopps system improperly placed in the original notice.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice.  It is NOT a solicitation for proposals.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this notice, and will NOT reimburse any cost incurred in response to this notice.  Responses to this notice will be used for information and planning purposes to identify potential sources capable of providing Emergency Department (E.D.) coverage at the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAHMCS), located at 10 North Greene Street; Baltimore, MD 21201.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621111 with a size standard of $10.0 million (USD).

Interested parties responding to this notice MUST be capable of providing physicians that are Board Certified/Board Eligible in Emergency Medicine or Internal Medicine, and fully licensed to practice in any state in the United States.  The Contractor will provide physician coverage to sustain the current volume of approximately 25,000 patients in the E.D. annually, where 80% of those patients are seen between 9am to 9pm and are designated at ESI levels 3-5.  Reference the following site for information on ESI levels: http://www.ahrq.gov/research/esi/esihandbk.pdf.  The E.D. operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  The contractor will ensure its staff have been credentialed and privileged by the VA prior to furnishing services; coordinate efforts to meet and exceed Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) Performance Measure and Monitor goals for quality of care provided to veterans evaluated and managed in the E.D.; as well as meet customary metrics, measures, patient satisfaction, patient flow standards and practices in a manner which supports the principles and practices of the VHA Systems Redesign Program.

The E.D. does not cover 911 trauma (e.g., does not participate in the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems - MIEMSS), pediatrics or OB.  Duties include, but are not limited to, providing professional direction of all clinical care (e.g., obtain patient health history, perform physical examinations, formulate diagnostic and therapeutic plans) and special procedures performed in the E.D.; provide oversight for VAMHCS Emergency Medicine Physician Assistants; documenting care provided in the Electronic Medical Record and Electronic Encounter form in the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) by the end of each tour of duty in accordance with VAMHCS policy; and ensuring that the ratio of patient visits to physician hours will average at least 2.0 patients per hour as the performance requirement for this contract, except in situations where the lack of patient volume on a particular shift does not support the requisite 2.0 patients per hour metric.  The contractor must also use the VA Emergency Department Integration Software (EDIS), which extends the capabilities of CPRS to help healthcare professionals track and manage the flow of patient care in the emergency-department setting, and is also used to create administrative reports.

Interested parties shall respond no later than close of business on December 30, 2011, and shall provide the following information:

1) Name of business;
2) DUNS number;
3) Description of how your firm recruits emergency physicians; and
4) A description of your firms current and future ability to provide the coverage required in this notice

If a formal solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that the award date of any resultant contract would be on or about February 1, 2013. The contract period of performance would consist of a one-year base period, and four 1-year option periods.

NOTE: Key personnel will be listed in the contract. No substitutions of key personnel will be allowed for the first 90 days. Any substitutions thereafter must be approved in advance by the VA Chief of Staff for the VAMHCS.

<AWARDEE>GENERAL DYNAMICS C4 SYSTEMS, INC. (121540038) <br> 8201 E MCDOWELL RD<br> SCOTTSDALE, AZ 85257-3812
<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>The US Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, awarded Contract W15P7T-12-D-C008 to General Dynamics C4 Systems (Scottsdale, AZ) in the amount of $46,213,099.27 on 06 December 2011.  This requirement is a 5 year sole source procurement for spare parts, repair services, and technical support services for the Common Ground Station (CGS)/Joint Services Workstation (JSWS), which is part of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. POCs are Carla Lueddeke, Contract Specialist (443)861-4790 (Carla.J.Lueddeke.civ@mail.mil) and Frank S. Caltabilota, Contracting Officer (443)655-7817 (Frank.S.Caltabilota.civ@mail.mil).<br><br>Original Synopsis:<br>Added: Jan 09, 2009 12:44 pm<br>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000, intends to issue a sole source procurement for spare parts, repair services, and technical support services for the Common Ground Station (CGS)/Joint Services Workstation (JSWS), which is part of the Joint Surveillance Target<br>Attack Radar System, to General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), Scottsdale, AZ. The Government does not possess all of the detailed design information or specifications that any source, other than GDC4S, would need in order to produce spare parts for the CGS/JSWS that meet the Governments form, fit, and function requirements.<br>GDC4S is the configuration manager for the CGS/JSWS and controls the design below the performance specification level. GDC4S proprietary data, to include drawings, software, source codes, and test and calibration procedures, is needed to assure interoperability and interchangeability with CGSs/JSWSs that have been previously procured from GDC4S. Only GDC4S possesses the unique knowledge of the CGS/JSWS design and, consequently, it is the only source that can provide the required spare parts. The intended resulting contract will be a five (5) year Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract for spare parts with Time and<br>Materials line items for spares with a minimum guarantee of $2,500,000.00, which will be awarded under the initial Delivery Order and an estimated overall contract ceiling value of $47,000,000.00. This sole source procurement is authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and 10USC2304(c)(1). The solicitation document will be posted on or about 02 February 2009 via the Armys Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP).<br>The US Army, CECOM Contracting Center has established the IBOP website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry. All parties interested in doing business with CECOM LCMC are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at htts://abop.monmouth.army.mil. To register, go to the IBOP website at<br>https://abop.monmouth.army.mil and click on the User Registration link under Support Services. <br><br>***Revised- Minimum buy guarentee was reduced to $500k before contract award at the discretion of General Dynamics C4 Systems and the Government.***

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1,  Boston VA Medical Center
West Roxbury Campus, Cardiac Catheterization Lab on transaction # 523-12-1-7902-0009

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Request to purchase direct patient care supply item  EZ Steer Ultrasound Catheter and accessories from Johnson and Johnson Healthcare, Biosense Webster  Division, 14201 NW 60th Ave. Miami Lakes, Fla.33014 Tel# 305-824-2900.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
The accessories are to be used in conjunction with the Carto XP Cardiac Electro anatomical Mapping System from Biosense-Webster, Incorporated.   Estimated Cost $42,189.00

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
The incorporation of a sophisticated technology such as Carto Sound will limit procedural times associated with patient and staff exposure to ionizing radiation. This cannot be over-emphasized secondary to the known medical fact that ionizing radiation is hazardous to humans and utilization of an alternative imaging format will minimize that procedural associate health risk.  There are no other companies that manufacture these types of catheters which are compatible with the Carto XP Cardiac Electro anatomical Mapping System.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
The following requirement has a total value of $42,189.00.  No other sources were solicited.  Biosense Webster is the sole manufacturer and distributer of these types of supplies.  These items are urgently needed for an upcoming surgical procedure in order to continue to provide comprehensive care to our veteran population. There are no other companies that manufacture these types of catheters which are compatible with the Carto XP Cardiac Electro anatomical Mapping System.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition is $42,189.00.  The Contracting Officer determined that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that the cost to the VA represents the pricing offered by Biosense to all of its' commercial clients.  In addition, the pricing is consistent with prior purchases.  In addition, the vendor's past performance has always been exceptional and deliveries have always been on time.  These are needed in stock for upcoming procedures. There are no other companies that manufacture these types of catheters which are compatible with the Carto XP Cardiac Electro anatomical Mapping System.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Biosense Webster is the sole manufacturer and distributer of these types of supplies.  There are no other companies that manufacture these types of catheters which are compatible with the Carto XP Cardiac Electro anatomical Mapping System.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
This catheter is only manufactured and sold by the Biosense Webster a division of Johnson and Johnson Healthcare.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Contracting Activity will continue to encourage brand name or equivalent specifications.
