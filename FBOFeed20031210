<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of an existing TechtracS Project for 4D software license. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from 4D, Inc., as the only known source who can meet Agency needs.  4D developed the TectracS Project software, which is used in support of the Commercialization Tracking System for use on the databases throughout Langley Research Center.  This software has been used since 1992.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to develop an acceptable software and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 18, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<RESPDATE>010904
<ARCHDATE>12092004
<CONTACT>Kristin E. Young Contracting Officer 5038722827     kristin_young@r1.fws.gov;
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD TO A SINGLE SOURCE: ECO-NORTHWEST, of Selah, Washington, is requested based on 1) their technical scientific expertise and professional work with  listed anadromous fish populations in the Yakima Basin and 2) their proven experience dealing with the two major agencies needed to prepare the Biological Assessment document.  ECO-NORTHWEST was the contractor who prepared  a BA for the Wapato Irrigation Project for their activities  in Yakima Basin including Toppenish Creek. DESCRIPTION:  Provide all research including background information and collection of biological information for preparation of a Biological Assessment (BA); coordinate preparation of the BA with the Refuge and State & Federal agencies and the Yakama Nation; and provide all labor, editing, materials, and production to produce a final BA report for distribution.  The report will assess effects from the operation and management of the Toppenish Refuge and it's wetland/water management program on threatened status population of Toppenish Creek steelhead.  The report will also address both juvenile and adult passage of all anadromous fish in the Toppenish/Snake Creek system.  The scientific report will be in final form for submission directly to NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service.  Project includes all consultation with  NOAA-NMFS, Yakama Nation and USFWS prior to and during the preparation of the BA. REQUIREMENTS:  To successfully complete the BA document the contractor will need to not only be familiar on a professional and experiential level with the fishery  resources and complex steelhead biology within the Toppenish Creek system, but the contractor will also have to meet with, interface and coordinate the BA document preparation with the National Marine Fisheries Service  and the Yakama Nation.  Good Tribal relations is paramount in obtaining their cooperation and involvement in the BA preparation process; so the contractor must have a proven record of working with Tribal fishery biologists.  In addition, the contractor must document previous experience in the preparation of a technically accurate and scientifically accepted Biological Assessment addressing a Federally listed anadromous fish in the Yakima SubBasin of the Columbia River Ecosystem.

<CONTACT>Roger L. Lockhart Contract Specialist 4046794146 roger_lockhart@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to conduct specialized research in Horry, Marion, and Georgetown Counties in South Carolina.  This research involves properly placing the early Proprietary and King's Grants for land in these areas.  This area has a rich cultural and historical heritage that has gone relatively unnoticed mainly because of the difficulty in tracing the early land titles and inhabitants.  Prior to the nineteenth century, records for this area were kept in Charleston and Georgetown Counties.  The records for Georgetown District (1785 - 1862) were burned during the Civil War.  Horry and Marion Counties were formed c. 1802 from Georgetown District; therefore, records for these counties from the period 1785 - 1802 are no longer available.  The original grants and plats were kept in Charleston and most of these are still intact.  Oftentimes, it is only through a detailed study of the early land grants and the early land grantees that the properties can be property placed.  The very earliest grants are the most difficult to find because many of these were granted to the early Landgraves and Cassiques who often did not take the time to have the properties surveyed.  They received so many grants and such a huge amount of land that they generally passed title to the properties, placing the responsibility on the subsequent land owner to have the properties surveyed and platted.  The method of study starts with locating the original land grants filed in Charleston, with copies at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History in Columbia.  These grants would preliminarily be laid out in map form.  These grants must then be confirmed by a search of the title which involves a study of the following:  (i)  Charleston deeds - housed in Charleston, with copies at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History in Columbia; (ii)  Memorials -  housed in Charleston, with copies at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History in Columbia.  Memorials were required by the British Crown for all land owners to ensure proper taxation;  (iii)  Quit Rents -  housed in Charleston, with copies at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History in Columbia.  When a tract of land was granted by the King, he charged a fee based on the amount of land granted; usually so many pence per hundred acres.  There are four volumes of these existing which cover the years 1735 - 1742 and 1760 - 1774.  When deeds were not recorded by a landowner and the descent of title to a tract of land was not mentioned in a Memorial, the Quit Rent books often show from whom the land was purchased and the date of purchase; (iv)  Will Books - these four books have been abstracted and are in volume form.  They are generally in most libraries.  Transfer of land by will is one of the more common forms of land descent; (v)  Individual genealogies - sometimes to follow the descent of a particular grant, it will be necessary to study an entire family.  This information can be found in private collections, historical societies, and on the internet; (vi) Miscellaneous records -  housed in Charleston, with copies at the South Carolina Department of Archives and History in Columbia.  These records include the estates of the deceased grantees and their assignees among other records not included in land transfers; and, (vii)  Georgetown, Marion, and Horry Counties deeds - these are housed at the various courthouses and in the case of Marion County, at the Marion County Historical Society.  The FWS intends to award a Firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation.  The issue date of the RFQ will be on or about December 22, 2003, with a tentative closing date of February 5, 2004.  The FWS is currently using Electronic Commerce to issue solicitations and resulting awards.  You may view this RFQ a http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Solar Physics Branch of Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Commercial item/services: the development of a Normal-incidence EXtreme-Uv Spectrometer (NEXUS), as a potential scientific payload to be flown on future space satellite missions. This instrument would perform spectroscopic studies of the outer atmosphere of the Sun at EUV wavelengths.  It uses a concave stigmatic grating at near-normal incidence which provides spectral imaging over an extended wavelength interval and spatial field-of-view with only a single reflecting surface. The optical design of the NEXUS spectrograph requires a grating with varied line space rulings of the Kita/Harada type, ruled onto a concave toroidal substrate.  It simultaneously covers the 3 spectral bandpasses of 45.7-52.5, 56.6-63.1, and 74.3-80.0 nm, with a fixed operating angle of Alpha=1.061 deg. This specification is directed towards the procurement of one (1) copy of the required NEXUS spectrograph grating.  This grating will then be evaluated to select the supplier for possible flight-grating orders in the future.  The government may make up to two awards. The bids will be evaluated based on the ability to meet specification (See attached document), cost and length of delivery schedule. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are  333314 and 500, respectively.	 All offerors should submit proposals electronically no later than 1pm EST on Thursday, December 18, 2003. Electronic submissions should be sent to Cathy Marx (Cathy.Marx@nasa.gov) and Teresa Anthony (Teresa.Anthony@nasa.gov).

<CONTACT>Stephanie Baker, Contract Specialist, Phone (703)681-0323, Fax (703)681-1211, Email bakers@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>The proposed Reliability Analysis Center (RAC) acquisition will provide valuable assistance to military and commercial researchers and engineers in the areas of Reliability, Maintainability, Quality, Supportability and Interoperability (R/M/Q/S/I) of DoD systems, military systems, and the industrial and research base, which supports such systems.  The RAC is one of thirteen contractor-operated DoD chartered Information Analysis Centers (IAC) which collect, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate scientific and technical information (STI) and promote standardization within their respective fields.  The RAC is the focal point to improve the R/M/Q/S/I of systems and manufactured components.  The RAC contractor shall continually monitor and extract R/M/Q/S/I related STI from worldwide engineering, technical and scientific information sources, including documents, databases, and electronic, paper, and other information media.  In order to facilitate use of STI, the contractor shall perform studies and analyses; collect, synthesize, and disseminate STI; develop and maintain inventories of relevant information, easily searchable and accessible information repositories, and experts; and provide scientific and technical advice to Government, industry, academia, and other approved domestic users.  In addition, the contractor shall perform Technical Area Tasks (TATS) relevant to this technology, for the purpose of solving specific problems or providing analytical support.  The contractor shall ensure maximum use of the resources of other DoD IACs.  RAC information collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts should facilitate use of existing STI, while reducing unnecessary duplication of research, information collection and analysis, and information dissemination efforts.  The RAC should be operated in a manner that reduces incentives to establish redundant collection of R/M/S/Q/I related STI.  The contractor shall identify and seek out opportunities to provide R/M/S/Q/I information to DoD components, other U.S. Government agencies and departments, their contractors, and other authorized users of RAC information and services. The RAC will provide services, products, and training.

A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) term form base contract period is anticipated, with nine, one-year option periods.  TATs will be either completion or term form.

DISA intends to release a Request For Proposal (RFP) under the above referenced solicitation number for the RAC on, or about, 29 Dec 2003, with a closing date approximately 45 days thereafter.

The successful offeror is required to have a Secret Clearance.

This solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps using Full- And-Open-Competition in accordance with FAR Part 6.  Due to the range of services to be supported under the contract, and the rapidly changing nature of R&D, the Government encourages the contractor to team or sub-contract with companies that provide new and innovative services.

<DESC>ASC/CVH, 1450 Littrell Road, Room 7, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 intends to negotiate with The Properties at Wright Field, LLC, 4334 Glendale- Milford Road, Cincinnati, OH 45242-3706 on a sole source basis for the  privatization of an additional 496 units of military family housing at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The  transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but instead  will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from  individual military service members’ monthly basic allowance for housing  payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct,  maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.   Estimated Transaction Closing: 1 October 2004 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON  TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with The  Properties at Wright Field, LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of 1536  residential units at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. NO DATA/DRAWINGS  AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be December 2003.   Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has concluded  that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are uniquely  available from only one source, because only the current privatization  developer is able to satisfy the agency’s needs to reduce the total number of  family housing units at Wright-Patterson AFB while maintaining units in on-base  locations, to assure that only military families reside in core security areas  of the base, and to assure that non-military families, if permitted to rent  under the tenant eligibility waterfall which is invoked in the event of low  military occupancy rates, can be diverted to remote/peripheral units where  security is less a concern. An attempt to compete this requirement would also  result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through  competition.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a request  for competitive proposals. Developers interested in providing an offer must be  able to demonstrate in writing, by two weeks from date this synopsis is  published, their capability to privatize the required units despite lack of  priority referrals and despite lack of a waterfall permitting filling vacancies  in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement. A determination by the agency not to compete this  proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the agency. The agency will not pay for any information received.  A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted at   www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil on or about 1 February 2004.    It is suggested that  small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in  connection with the described real estate transaction contact the incumbent  developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any  submissions, is the Original Point of Contact listed below.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Vasil Pano, Director Strategic Sector Privatization Department, Ministry of Economy, Bulevardi Zhan D’Ark; Tirana, Albania; Phone: (355) 4-225-154; Fax: (355) 4-225-154.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an integrated infrastructure and economic development project at the Albanian Port of Vlore.

There are four ports along the Albanian shoreline: Durres, Vlore, Saranda, and Shengjini.  The Port of Durres is the most developed and the largest port in Albania and is responsible for handling over 85 percent of the country's international maritime traffic.  It has 9-10 berths of approximately 2,000 meters in length with a draught ranging from 7 to 9.85 meters.  The second strategic port of the country, the Port of Vlore, offers three berths of 100 meters in length and each of these is five to nine meters in depth.  The ports at Saranda and Shengjini do not handle a significant amount of traffic at this time.

Vlore, with a population of around 100,000, is located in southwestern Albania, on the coast of the Adriatic.  The existing traffic (tonnage per year) at the Port of Vlore is around 600,000 (592,000 in 2001).  It is projected that by year 2015 this figure will reach 1.1 million, out of which 98% is expected to be international exchange.  Due to these growth figures, the Port of Vlore has become a major player in Albania’s developmental strategy for the country’s growth and is receiving attention from multilateral development institutions. 

The World Bank is evaluating a proposed project to build a new 100 MW thermal power station at the Port of Vlore.  The project has an estimated cost of $100 million, and if approved, will be co-financed by the World Bank and EBRD.  The proposed thermal power station is to be located at the Port of Vlore and will require imported petroleum that would need to be brought through the Port.  Also, in order to have sufficient fuel reserve capacity, the power plant will need a storage facility at or around the Port along with a distribution system (pipeline, compressions station, and pumps) for the fuel to be transported directly to the plant.  

In addition to the proposed new facilities to accommodate the new thermal power plant, the Government of Albania (GOA) is interested in increasing tourism of Vlore with the Port of Vlore serving increasing numbers passenger ships along with cargo.  Therefore, the GOA would like to consider the feasibility of a separate passenger terminal including immigration and customs facilities. 

The GOA recently declared the Port of Vlore a Free Trade Zone as a way to foster and expand regional trade within the Southeastern European Region (SEE). The change in distinction of the Port does not alter any Albanian laws that would specifically attract industrial development, but initial forecasts indicate that the change in the status of the Port of Vlore to a Free Trade Zone will considerably expand trade activity and private sector investment in and around Vlore.  Therefore, the Port would need to be expanded to handle the excess traffic.

The Albanian Ministry of Economy will oversee the development of this project.

The proposed Feasibility Study for the Port of Vlore would develop an integrated infrastructure and economic development project.  The extent of modernization and rehabilitation of the Port of Vlore is a function of the most likely levels of future cargo demand.  The three specific components of the Feasibility Study would include port development requirements for (1) the fuel facilities/requirements of the proposed thermal power station, (2) increase in tourism and adequate passenger facilities, and (3) expanded trade and cargo resulting from Vlore’s status as a Free Trade Zone.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $526,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., January 21, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Project:

The Corporation for National and Community Service, is a wholly owned Government Corporation, intends to award a contract. The Corporation is seeking a contractor to assist the Corporation in editing, reorganizing and streamlining its existing regulations, currently in chapters XII and XXV of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and assist in drafting proposed amendments to the Corporation’s AmeriCorps (including VISTA) and Learn and Serve program regulations.

Background:

Created in 1993, the Corporation for National Service and Community Service (Corporation) is a government corporation that oversees three national service initiatives—AmeriCorps, which includes AmeriCorps* VISTA, AmeriCorps* National Civilian Community Corps and hundreds of local and national non-profits; Learn and Serve America, which provides models and assistance to help teachers integrate service and learning from kindergarten through college; and the National Senior Service Corps, which includes the Foster Grandparent Program, the Senior Companions Program, and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP).

Currently, much of the Corporation’s guidance to and requirements of its grantees appears annually in our application guidelines and grant provisions.  (For examples of these documents, please refer to http://www.americorps.org/resources/guidelines2004.html and http://www.americorps.org/resources/manuals.html respectively).  The Code of Federal Regulations contains some guidance in common with the guidelines and the provisions, as well as substantial restatements of the Corporation’s authorizing legislation.

Our goal is to collect in one place – the Code of Federal Regulations – all of the requirements that apply to our grantees, as well as to develop new regulations to implement some important changes to our programs.  The regulations must be in clear, unambiguous prose that a general audience can understand.  This project will be full-time, intensive, and on an extremely short time-frame, with a goal of sharing a draft of the proposed rule with OMB by March 1st, 2004.

<DESC>Statement of Work 

Title:  Calculation and Mailing of Regulatory Fee Assessment Notification Postcards
Location: Office of Managing Director, Federal Communications Commission


Project Goal:

To improve the effectiveness of the FCC’s Regulatory Fee program and increase the program’s collection process by:

•	Assessing the appropriate regulatory fee that is due of all U.S.-licensed, commercial entities in the following fee categories: AM and FM Radio Stations, AM and FM Construction Permits, FM Translators/Boosters, VHF and UHF Television Stations, VHF and UHF Television Construction Permits, Satellite Television Stations, Satellite Television Construction Permits, Low Power Television (LPTV) Stations, and LPTV Translators/Boosters.

•	Mailing postcards, on a facility ID basis, to the entities listed above in order to provide notification of the assessed fee amounts that are due for each facility ID.   

•	Linking, to the extent possible, entities to their respective Federal Registration Number(s) (FRN) in order to ensure each entity’s fee sufficiency across multiple fee categories and for any given fiscal year.

•	Analyzing end-of-year regulatory fee payment data for fee sufficiency and sending collections letters to fee deficient entities in an expedient manner.


Project Summary:

Section 9(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, authorizes the Commission to collect annual regulatory fees to recover the annual costs of its enforcement, policy and rulemaking, user information, and international activities.  The Commission’s Schedule of Fees sets forth annual regulatory fees for specific categories of regulatees in the Media, Cable Television, Wireline, Wireless, and International Services. 

In carrying out the Commission’s annual regulatory fee notification and collection activities, we seek the assistance of a Contractor who can (1) compile a comprehensive spreadsheet of the above Media Services entities on a facility ID basis, including addresses, population counts and other data attributes necessary for calculating regulatory fees; (2) prepare and mail assessment notification postcards to all entities and/or their respective legal representatives; and (3) compile a fee payment report from which to generate collections letters by comparing end-of-year regulatory fee payment data to the comprehensive spreadsheet of Media Services entities.

The Commission will use its existing CORES database to establish all possible links between the entities and their respective FRNs.  The Contractor will then compare its independent database to the CORES data and data gleaned from the Media Bureau’s Consolidated Database System (CDBS) in order to assure that the addresses used for the postcard mailings are based on the best possible data.  The compilation of CORES data and the contractor’s data will then enable the Commission to ensure the above entities’ fee sufficiency across multiple fee categories for any given fiscal year, and to readily identify non-payments and other fee deficiency issues.


Scope of Work:

Deliverables for this project will include three major reports to the Commission and one batch of postcards.  Deliverables may also include such interim reports to the Commission and samples as are appropriate to the progress of the project.

The first report delivered will be a Management Summary Report that indicates revenue by fee code and classification of AM/FM/TV stations.  The second report will be a Detailed Report (a.k.a. a comprehensive spreadsheet) of records on a facility ID basis.  Each record, at a minimum, will have a field for facility ID, call sign, licensee’s FRN and/or additional FRNs associated with the facility ID, licensee name and address, calculated fee, payment type code, and sufficient information to determine the basis of the calculation.  The last report will be a Payment Report derived from CORES/RAMIS payment data.  It will indicate, on a facility ID basis, FY 2004 regulatory fee payments received for each facility ID, payment type codes and the FRN associated with the payment.  The reports will be provided to the Commission electronically in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

The postcards will be printed by the contractor or a subcontractor to the contractor.  The postcards will be mailed to Media Services entities.  The postcards will be mailed by the contractor.  

Depending upon the success and progress of this project with media services entities, the COTR may broaden the scope of this contract by activating options to create spreadsheet reports and to mail assessment notification postcards to additional regulatory fee service categories.  However, the COTR and the Contractor first must mutually agree to exercise any additional options.  No options to this contract can be activated in lieu of, at the expense of, or as a substitute to, the fundamental contract deliverables; i.e. spreadsheet reports and assessment notification postcards for media services entities.  See also Optional Deliverables section.





Deliverables:

The following deliverables are scheduled for 2004.  However, this is a five-year multi-year contract that can be extended in one-year increments as far as September 30, 2008 at the mutual consent of both parties.  If this contract is extended into Contract Years 2-5, the schedule of deliverables shall repeat itself each time of year for the subsequent Contract Year in question. 

No specific calendar date is attached to Deliverable 1 in Contract Year 1.  As such, the scheduled calendar date for Deliverable 1 in Contract Years 2-5 shall be deemed February 1 of each subsequent Contract Year.

Deliverable 1 – No later than three weeks after the award of contract, the contractor will provide the Commission’s Performance Evaluation and Records Management Office (PERM) staff with the following: (1) an evaluation of the quality of fit between CORES, CDBS and contractor data; (2) an initial Management Summary Report of revenue by fee code; and (3) an estimate of the number of postcards that will be generated for the mailings.  

The initial Management Summary Report will be provided either electronically or in hard-copy.  The Management Summary Report will be based on the regulatory fee structure of the prior year (FY 2003), and will indicate revenue by fee code and classification of AM/FM/TV stations.

Deliverable 2 – By May 1, 2004, the contractor will provide to PERM a final Management Summary Report, based on the FY 2003 regulatory fee structure.  This report will indicate revenue by fee code and classification of AM/FM/TV stations.  The contractor will provide the final Management Summary Report electronically in the format of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

Deliverable 3 – By May 10, 2004, the contractor will provide to PERM staff a draft design of the initial version of the assessment notification postcards, as well as a sample of the paper stock on which they will be printed.  PERM staff will approve or edit the draft design in one or more cycles of information exchange with the contractor until PERM gives its commitment for the final look and content of the postcards by June 1, 2004.  

Deliverable 4 – By June 8, 2004, the contractor will provide PERM staff with a web address that permits access to the contractor’s electronic database of AM/FM/TV entities on the basis of facility identification number.  From this web address, PERM staff will be able to search all non-proprietary records for each facility and will be able to rewrite information such as facility address, facility fee-exempt status and contact information.  Web access to the database will be provided to no fewer than four PERM employees.  The web access will be provided continuously until September 30, 2003 at 11:59 p.m.

By June 15, 2004, the contractor will make the web address available and functional for media services entities to review their facility information and make changes to information such as facility address, facility fee-exempt status and contact information.

Deliverable 5 – By June 15, 2004, the contractor will have the postcards printed and ready to mail.  The contractor will mail the postcards.  The exact date of the mailing will be determined by PERM, but will be no earlier than June 15, 2004.

Regardless of format, the postcards are to contain the following information:  Facility ID, Call Sign, Contact Address, Fee Type, Fee Amount, Market Ranking (TV) or Class of Station (AM/FM), Population Served (AM/FM), and FRN associated with the Facility ID.

Deliverable 6 – From June through September 2004, the contractor will address, without PERM’s assistance or participation, up to 100 fee or station classification inquiries from AM/FM radio stations and up to 50 fee or station classification inquiries from VHF/UHF television stations.  Regulatory fee amounts for media services are driven by station classification; therefore, we anticipate that a number of entities will question or seek clarification of the criteria that was used to classify their radio or television stations.

The Commission will pay the contractor $50.00 per inquiry to address inquiries from AM/FM stations that exceed 100 and to address inquiries from VHF/UHF stations that exceed 50.  Prior to paying the contractor to address inquiries that exceed either category, the contractor will first provide the Commission with a log that shows at a minimum the company name, contact person and telephone number for each inquiry, the time of call, and a brief description of the nature of the inquiry. 

Deliverable 7 – By October 10, 2004, the contractor will provide to PERM a Detailed Report of Media Services entities.  This detailed report is actually the comprehensive spreadsheet of media services licenses.  The contractor will generate it by integrating its own data with the Commission’s data.  The resulting deliverable will then be a comprehensive spreadsheet of the most accurate and current information available concerning media services licensees.

The Detailed Report will be a spreadsheet of records listed by facility ID.  At a minimum, each records shall contain the following data fields: call sign, licensee’s FRN and/or additional FRNs associated with the facility ID, licensee name and address, telephone number, calculated fee, FY 2004 payment type code, and sufficient information to determine the basis of the calculation, including market rankings for TV stations and populations served for AM/FM radio stations.  The contractor will provide the Detailed Report electronically in the format of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and will provide a master copy of the report on diskette, CD-ROM or other media format accepted by PERM staff.

Deliverable 8 – By October 15, 2004, the Contractor will provide an initial Payment Report.  The Payment Report will consist of FY 2004 regulatory fee payment data received from CORES/RAMIS, coupled with the facility ID records populated in the Detailed Report.  The Payment Report therefore will enable Commission staff to easily identify regulatory fee payments made for each facility ID, as well as non-payments, underpayments and any other payment discrepancies on a Facility ID basis.  

After the COTR reviews the initial Payment Report, the Contractor, at the COTR’s option, may further refine the Payment Report’s data in an attempt to increase the number or percentage of exact matches in the following data fields for each record:  facility ID, call sign, payment type code, and fee amount.  The amount of refinement needed to be applied to the initial Payment Report will be dependent upon the quality of the payment data; i.e., how completely and accurately fee payers submitted their FCC Form 159 fee payment data in CORES/RAMIS.

All data refinement exercises must be pre-approved by the COTR before the Contractor commences any work.  The COTR may also instruct the Contractor to cease all data refinement work if it is not yielding results satisfactory to the COTR.  The amount of data refinement will be limited to both the funds available and the due date for the final Payment Report.  In the event that funds for data refinement are not exhausted, refinement work will cease when the percentage of records with exact matches reaches 99%.  

After all data refinement exercises are completed or ceased, the initial Payment Report will be known as the final Payment Report.

Deliverable 9 – By October 31, 2004, the Contractor will provide the final Payment Report to PERM staff.


Optional Deliverables:

Upon the mutual agreement of the COTR and the Contractor, identical tasks and deliverables (spreadsheet development and postcard mailing) may be applied to the regulatory fee service categories of cable subscribers, cable antennae relay service station (CARS) licensees, and/or satellite earth station licensees.  Some aspects of cable subscriber and cable operator data are maintained by the Media Bureau.  These data are also made publicly available by various commercial research companies.  CARS data are maintained in the Media Bureau’s Cable Operations and Licensing System (COALS) database; earth station data are maintained in the International Bureau’s International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) database.  

Any options that are activated must progress on a schedule of deliverables that is in line with the schedule of deliverables for media services entities.  Specifically, optional deliverable dates shall lag no more than two weeks behind the deliverable dates established for media services entities.


Required Fee Calculation Methodology:

For commercial VHF/UHF television stations, the Contractor will base the regulatory fee amount upon the size of each station’s Nielson Designated Market Area (DMA) as listed in the 2004 Edition of the Television & Cable Factbook, Stations Volume No. 72, Warren Publishing, Inc. 

For commercial AM/FM radio stations, the Contractor will base the regulatory fee amount upon station classification and population served by the station within its city grade coverage area.  The Contractor’s source of population data will be U.S. Census data for 2000.  To calculate fees for AM/FM radio stations, the Contractor will first apply data values contained in CDBS to predict each station’s distance to the city grade contour for each of 72 radials.  The resulting distance to city grade contours will then be used to form a geographical polygon.  Population counts for each station are then to be calculated by determining which 2000 block centroids are contained in the station’s polygon.  The sum of the population figures for all enclosed block centroids represents the total population for the predicted city grade coverage area.


Contractor Qualifications:

To qualify for consideration for this contract, the selected Contractor must maintain its own database or otherwise automated system of records for media services entities that is independent of the Media Bureau’s Consolidated Database System (CDBS).  

Absent exigent circumstances, the Contractor shall be available upon three business days notice from Commission or PERM staff to attend meetings with Commission or PERM staff and/or any outside experts or contractors retained by the Commission, in order to present, discuss and/or analyze the contractor’s work products and the Commission’s needs. 


Special Contractor Requirements:

A.  Data rights:  

The products created as part of this contract are Excel-based spreadsheets.  The spreadsheets will contain attributes such as licensee names, addresses, call signs, FRN's, market area size (for television stations) and population served (for radio stations) for media services licensees.  The spreadsheets will be used to direct the mailing of assessment notification postcards and to determine the fee payment status of facility IDs at the close of the FY 2004 regulatory fee season.  

In performing this contract, the Contractor will not develop software for the FCC.  Rather, the Contractor will compile spreadsheets of records in support of the Commission’s regulatory fee assessment initiative.  All records’ attributes in the spreadsheets will consist of publicly available information except for one attribute – the radio station population served attribute.  The Commission assumes that the population served attribute will be calculated through software developed at the Contractor’s private expense and that the resulting population served data embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.  As such, the population served data will be treated as limited rights data and the provisions of the FAR “Rights in Data” clause are hereby incorporated by reference.  See 48 C.F.R. § 52.227-14, Alt. I.  

In furtherance of the FCC’s regulatory fee assessment process, the contractor agrees to allow access to the population served data attribute on an individual query basis.  As such, all attributes of a single record may be queried by the public one record at a time by entering the unique data of either a facility ID or a call sign into a web-based search engine provided by the Commission.  The Contractor does not authorize any other public access or use of population served data except as specifically provided above.

In accordance with agency regulations, the Contractor shall be notified of any requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for access to the population served data beyond the limited use provided for above, and will be given the opportunity to oppose the release of this information. See 47 C.F.R. § 0.461. Under these rules, the Commission will not release the commercial and proprietary data for which Contractor has requested confidentiality prior to its notification and in accordance with the protections afforded by the FOIA regulations.  

To facilitate the Contractor’s request for limited use/confidential treatment of the population served data, at the time of delivery the Contractor should note and describe which portion of the spreadsheet(s) is encompassed by the provisions of this clause.


Deliverable Format:

Regarding the preliminary evaluation of the quality of fit between CORES, CDBS and contractor data, PERM will accept the evaluation in verbal or written form.  Regarding the postcards, PERM will accept the initial design for the postcards based upon Commission standards for mailings.  The Contractor will provide all reports, including the final Detailed Report (a.k.a. the comprehensive spreadsheet) and Payment Report electronically in the format of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  The Contractor will also provide a master copy of the Detailed Report and Payment Report on diskette, CD-ROM or other media format accepted by PERM staff.


Period of Performance:

This Task Order shall be effective from date of its execution until September 30, 2004.  However, as a five-year multi-year contract, its effectiveness may be extended in one-year increments as far as September 30, 2008 at the mutual consent of both parties.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>****The purpose of this modification to the original notice is to extend the response time for submission of a quotation until 16 Dec 2003, 2:00 P.M. EST.****

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number for this agreement is FA4830-04-Q-0006 and is issued as a Request for Quotation.  The Government intends to award one or more Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA(s)) to offerors who can provide cable/ satellite /wireless television services on an as required basis and represents the best value to the government; this agreement is non-exclusive.  Term of Agreement:  Five Years.  Extent of Obligation:  The Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized calls made under the BPA.  The contractor shall submit their proposed price list for the tiers of service offered in addition to a complete description of tier package features and system design.    Specific agreement requirements may include completion of a Base Access Letter, License to use Real Property, and Franchise Agreement depending on the type of system proposed.  The contractor shall have the capability to install, provide, and maintain commercial and government television programming to over 337 separate locations on Moody AFB with ability to add more points of service.  Residential television programming subscription service is not included in this solicitation.  Residential drops are defined as residential family housing units, not supported by 347 Communications Squadron and individual dormitory rooms on Moody AFB.  The contractor shall provide a minimum of three service packages including a variety of programming to include 24 hour news and weather, sports, top broadcast shows, local broadcast affiliates, and one government access channel for use by Moody AFB.  The minimum requirements for the packages are as follows: Plan A-56 Channels, Plan B-70 Channels, Plan C-100 Channels—Movie and Sports packages are optional in these plans.  It is desirable for the contractor to have the ability to provide one Government Access Channel on the system for noncommercial use by the government.  The system shall be designed and constructed to permit the government to originate programming for the Government Access Channel from the base’s multi-media center.  The Government will provide the A/V equipment to inject the signal.  The contractor shall furnish equipment required to inject standard audio and video, s-video, and composite video onto the contractor’s backbone equipment.  The contractor shall ensure that the Government Access Channel cannot be viewed outside the base.  It is also desirable for the contractor to provide an audio/video scrolling over-ride system for all units that are connected to the Moody AFB cable infrastructure.  This system will allow Moody AFB to interrupt video and audio signals and have capability to broadcast an emergency message to the base populace in the event of natural disasters and other emergencies.  Insertion of messages must occur at the wing command post.  If a dial-in control system is used, password protection is required.  The contractor shall provide, upon subscriber request, a channel locking devise or code that permits restriction of viewing premium channels and any other channel that may contain programming unsuitable for children.  The contractor shall not provide pay per view to non-residential or official areas.   The contractor shall furnish all necessary receivers and or cable boxes needed to provide cable service to official areas.  This will include more than one receiver/cable box per building if needed to provide access to multiple television sets.  The contractor shall provide the capability to independently select programming at each television.  Splitting the signal to other televisions in the building is not acceptable service.  The contractor must allow for expansion to new government facilities.  The ability to rebroadcast television programming and the government access channel onto government LAN system for access by all Moody AFB network users will be considered a desirable feature of system design.  The contractor shall install and maintain the necessary hardware to provide ten channels to the governments internet protocol television system in the form of very high frequency (VHF) channels 3 and or 4 on standard “RG” coaxial cable.  The government will provide, install, and maintain equipment needed to inject commercial and government programming onto the government LAN.  The government will supply standard A/V production equipment for injection of the Government Access Channel signals onto Contractor’s system.  The contractor shall maintain a telephone answering service for receiving complaints and requests for service and repairs during all hours when their business office is closed.  The telephone number for the answering service shall be publicly listed and printed on each subscriber’s monthly bill.

The contractor shall not hire off duty Air Force QAEs or any other person whose employment would result in a conflict of interest or would otherwise violate the Joint Ethics Regulation, DoD Directive 5500.7-R.  The contractor shall provide in writing a point of contact (POC) and an alternate that shall be responsible for ensuring that the contract services are performed satisfactorily; these POCs shall have full authority to act for the contractor on all contractual matters.  Any contract employee dealing with customers for installation or service shall be able to read, write, speak, and understand English.  Invoices shall be submitted monthly for “official government” drops; invoices will be paid by the Government Purchase Card.     The contractor shall promptly respond to requests for service, including installation, connection, disconnection, and repairs.  The contractor shall respond within 24 hours to any reported subscriber outages and within 4 hours to all system outages affecting more than 1 subscriber.  The contractor shall complete priority work within 5 duty days.  System outages will be restored within 24 hours of notification.  If digging is required for repair, all cable will be reburied upon completion.  Any new cable runs will be buried and contractor will attend a base digging meeting for approval.  The contractor shall maintain a log showing, (1) the time and date of repair service requested; (2) the date and nature of the response to repair service requests; (3) the date, approximate time, and duration, type and probable cause of all head end, trunk, or distribution line service failures due to other than routine testing or maintenance; and (4) total time to restore outage.  The contractor shall provide all outage log data upon request to the contracting officer or designated representative.  The contractor shall offer upgrades to their system with current technology comparable to the local community and surrounding area as they become available.  This agreement and subsequent modification will conform to FCC guidelines and standard industry practices.  The government may add or terminate services at any building, outlet, or drop without penalty.  There shall be no term or minimum length of service required for services at any location.  Agreements may be terminated by either party with 30 days notice; there shall be no fee for terminating service.  Construction of any equipment or facilities on the base requires the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer, the Base Civil Engineer, the Communications QAE, and other authorities required by standards and rules applicable to construction on base.  The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer three sets of comprehensive system drawings, plans, and other relevant data; including but not limited to franchise drawings showing cable routings, typical service entrances, antenna tower sites, technical center locations and other construction details.  Any time changes in cable routing, wiring, or other significant changes in facilities and equipment occur, the contractor shall submit three sets of revised drawings or other appropriate documents to the Contracting Officer (excluding routine maintenance and repairs not involving the installation of above ground/ below ground cables, poles or conduits or routine subscriber service connections and disconnections).  The Contracting Officer may at any time direct the contractor to remove, relocate, or modify any equipment or facilities, including above ground/below ground cable.  If the contractor is directed or receives permission to install its own cable carrying facility, the contractor grants to the government a free right of common use for purposes consistent with the operation of the cable system.  Upon termination or expiration of the agreement, the contractor shall restore government property to the condition of such property before the installation of such facilities.  If satellite services are proposed, contractors must minimize the number and size of satellite dishes used.  The aesthetics of system design and proposed technology will be considered during the award evaluation.  The contractor must provide a plant layout of Moody AFB which indicates all runs and amps needed for and /or installed on Moody AFB.  Updates will be submitted within 5 working days.  The contractor will ensure that the system is designed, installed, and operated in a manner which meets or exceeds the technical standards required or recommended by the FCC as set forth in 47 CFR Part 76.  Required and recommended standards are considered mandatory and shall apply to all classes of television channels.  The contractor recognizes that signal leakage or other interference, including emission, radiation, or induction from the cable or satellite system that affects the government’s air navigational, communications, or surveillance facilities, or other electronic device or equipment located on the installation may disrupt or endanger military activities and may pose a threat to the safety of both public and military personnel.  The contractor shall submit a plan which outlines all necessary actions proposed by the contractor to prevent leakage or interference.  The contractor shall conduct, at its own expense, all tests and measurements recommended or required by the FCC as set forth in 47 CFR Part 76.  Testing to ensure compliance with 47 CFR Part 76 must be accomplished twice annually at the contractor’s expense; documentation of all testing and test results will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer.  If the government suspects that there is reasonable concern the system does not meet the technical standards set forth, the contractor will be requested to accomplish out of cycle testing (at the contractor’s expense).  The government may inspect and conduct tests and measurement of the contractor’s equipment and facilities at any time; disruption of contractor operations will be minimized.  The following publications are considered mandatory: AFI 91-301, AFI 91-302, AFI 31-2001, NFPA Number 70/84, ANS 1-2, AFI 32-1023, FAA Standards for Markers and Lighting Obstruction to Air Navigation, and AFI 32-1044; a copy of these documents will be provided upon request.

Offerors planning to  submit bids for the TD P+P would be required to bid this work as well.  This  work would include software integration and travel, in order to interface the  TD P+P module of the EBS to GOTS prototype/proof of concept applications,  described below, that serve the automation needs of scientists and engineers.   This application, currently in development, will provide scientists an  intuitive interface to an automated process for creating, storing, and printing  Case Files.  Training needs are expected to be minimal to nonexistent.  We are  in the process of defining this requirement and will make more details  available as soon as possible.           Automated R+D Case File Proof of Concept - A build and automation of  process workflows that focus on AFRL Work Unit Management processes of the  S+Es. The application will build and then automate these workflows, where  additional user input screens will be designed and built to guide S+Es through  the data entry steps of each phase of Case File generation. A relational  database will be built to store normalized data for select AFRL forms so that  data entered once by the S+Es can be reused in future steps. Once forms are  complete and approved, the proof of concept will allow S+Es to print them for  physical filing into the paper Case File, as well as electronically file them  into the EBS Document and Records manager. The reporting features of the proof  of concept will ideally integrate the PureEdge form manager functionality,  depending on policy directives for use of that tool.           Work Center Support Proof of Concept - This user interface will be  designed and specifically configured for the S+Es. In this interface, S+Es will  be able to open a "one-stop-shop" portal instance and have access to select  common enterprise and personal applications and information. Ideally, each  individual application will appear in the interface as an object or applet,  which links to or initiates an application function as necessary. Some of these  applications have been identified and requested by the S+Es, a "yellow pages"  capability, for example. This build model will allow S+Es to access a list of  said application applets and "subscribe" to the functions of choice or  necessity. AFRL constituents, knowing the required framework for applet design  and configuration, could then potentially have their applications considered  for the applet library, assuming there are no technical, policy or process  conflicts. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST UPDATE:  The preliminary information  contained at the end of the Industry Day Q+A attachment has been coordinated  and approved and should be considered final. ======================================================================== 15 Oct 03: Updated: The draft model task order has been updated, as reflected  in the "Draft Model TO 15 Oct" version now visible on this website.  We have  added the IOC and FOC dates to the document. ======================================================================== 14 Oct 03:  Update:  Questions and Answers from Industry Day posted as an  attachment along with information on conflicts of interest.  DRAFT Model Task  Order added to documents list.  OFFERORS ARE REQUESTED TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS AND  PROVIDE ANY WRITTEN COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS TO christopher.parsons@wpafb.af.mil OR  lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil.  EARLY INDUSTRY INPUTS MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO TAILOR  THIS ACQUISITION. ======================================================================= 7 Oct 03 NOTICE: DRAFT Documents from Industry Day have been posted to this  website.  More to follow soon.  Request all PRIME Encore contractors verify  receipt of this updated information by sending a confirmation e-mail to  christopher.parsons@wpafb.af.mil or lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil.  Thank you. ====================================================================== The HQ Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is contemplating awarding a task  order pursuant to the authorities established under Defense Information Systems  Agency (DISA) Encore GWAC Contracts (http://www.acquireit.disa.mil).  The  following preliminary information is for all DISA Encore Contract Holders.   Interested subcontractors contact Encore prime contractors via the above DISA  website. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is drafting an IT requirement for  Technology Directorate-Level Planning and Programming (TD Level P+P).  The  purpose of this notice is to establish contact with all interested Encore  contractors and provide preliminary program information.

<CONTACT>Patricia Evans, 301-619-7354
<DESC>NA The intent of the Concept Award is to fund the exploration of an initial concept or theory that could give rise to a testable hypothesis.  Presentation of preliminary data is not consistent with the intent of this award mechanism.  Thus, data from prelimin ary studies are discouraged.  These awards provide investigators with the opportunity to pursue serendipitous observations; it is anticipated that research completed through a Concept Award may provide sufficient preliminary data to enable the investigator  to prepare a hypothesis-based proposal for future research.  Proposals must describe how the new concept or theory will enhance existing knowledge of breast cancer.   Topics of particular interest to the BCRP include, but are not limited to, systems biology, proteomics, computational biology, nanotechnology, early detection, and primary prevention.  Concepts from complementary areas of science such as chemistry, biophys ics, mathematics, engineering, etc. are encouraged as are research proposals submitted by consumers. Because these awards are designed for preliminary investigations, projects involving human subjects or human anatomical substances will not be supported through this mechanism unless they are exempt under 32 CFR 219.101(b)(4).  Studies that do not qualify for exempt status will be administratively withdrawn and will not be funded.   Funding for Concept Awards can be requested for a maximum of $75,000 for direct costs over a 1-year performance period, plus indirect costs as appropriate.  Projects requiring lower levels of funding may also be submitted.  These funds can cover salary, ex penses including research supplies, and travel to scientific/technical meetings.  The amount allotted for travel is $1,800 per year.  In addition, funding should be requested for a one-time, three and one-half day meeting in 2005 to disseminate the results  of DOD-sponsored research.   The nature of the BCRP does not allow for renewal of grants or supplementation of existing grants.  Depending on the quality and the number of proposals received, the CDMRP expects to allot approximately $20M to fund approximately 160 Concept Awards. Detailed description of the funding mechanisms, evaluation criteria, and submission requirements can be found in the FY03 BCRP Concept Award Program Announcement.  The Program Announcement can be downloaded from the CDRMP web site (http://cdmrp.army.mil).  All applicants will be required to submit one electronic versions of their proposal as a PDF (portable document format) file.  All documents may be downloaded from the CDMRP website. The website also contains further information about the, BCRP, BCRP awar dees, previous BCRP Program Announcements, and other CDMRP sponsored programs and events. Again the CDMRP web site is located at (http://cdmrp.army.mil). Questions related to the Program, proposal format or required documentation can be addressed to the CD MRP at 301-619-7079, Fax at 301-619-7792 or email at cdmrp.pa@det.amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>99--Expresssion of Interest to Build, Own, and Operate a Steam Generation Facility to Serve the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee
<SOLNBR>DE-EI05-04OR12091
<RESPDATE>013004
<CONTACT>Suzanne Chacko, Contracting Officer, 000-000-0000, chackosm@oro.doe.gov;Suzanne Chacko, Contract Specialist, 000-000-0000, chackosm@oro.doe.gov
<DESC>Background: The Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) owns and operates an on-site steam generation plant to serve facilities and processes at the Y-12 National Security Complex (NSC) at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This existing plant is approaching the end of its useful service life and is in need of upgrade/replacement.  DOE is exploring the possibility of purchasing steam from a private service provider as an option to continued self-generation. To assess the interest and determine the technical and economic feasibility of outsourcing, NNSA is seeking expressions of interest from responsible sources that have the capability to finance, construct, operate and maintain a facility. Depending on the outcome of this assessment, a Request for Proposal (RFP) may follow. Project Description: The selected service provider will be responsible for the financing, design, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance of a new steam generation system located on or adjacent to the Y-12 site. The government will consider selling/leasing land in the proximity of the Y-12 NSC to the service provider. The service provider will be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and for compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The service provider will also be responsible for the fuel procurement, delivery and storage and for the management and disposal for all waste including ash, wastewater, etc.  The service provider will be required to provide physical security for the steam generating plant in accordance with applicable DOE requirements.  DOE will not directly reimburse the service provider for the capital investment needed to finance, design, and construct the facility.  The service provider will recover its capital investment plus all operating expenses through the sale of steam to the Y-12 NSC. Brief Technical Description: The steam generation system will supply steam to the Y-12 complex at 235 psig and 500 OF. Delivery rates will vary from 450,000 pounds/hour in the winter to a low of 60,000 pounds/hour in the summer. Consumption by Y-12 is currently 1,300,000,000 pounds/year, but is expected to drop by 25 to 30% over the next 15 to 20 years. The distribution of steam within the Y-12 complex will remain the responsibility of the Government.  The Government will return a portion of the condensate to the steam generation plant.  The contract will include measurable service standards covering the quantity and quality of the delivered steam, the availability and reliability of the steam generating system, and response and resolution times for detecting and correcting failures in the service. The availability of the steam service is expected to be 0.9995 or greater. The service provider will be required to measure and report performance.  The service contract will include appropriate guarantees to ensure the Government that performance risks are adequately managed. Requested Information: The response to this EOI should include a statement indicating your interest in submitting a proposal for this work and provide information on your capability to perform the proposed work by specifically addressing the following areas.

FACILITY MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES MARKET RESEARCH FOR LOGWORLD SCHEDULE	


The General Services Administration's Management Services Center (MSC) located in Auburn, Washington is requesting agency/industry comment.  GSA is contemplating the addition of facilities management support services to the LOGWORLD Federal Supply Schedule.

Suggested NAICS:  561210, 561710, 561720, 561730, 561740, 561790

GSA is interested in finding ways to provide the Federal buying community with full solution facility services while fostering small business/NIB/NISH participation.

Industry comment is sought to assist in defining the scope of work needed by your Federal customers, the types of commercial services available, defining common commercial terms and conditions including pricing methods, your interest in participating in a Government wide contract, your business size, how can services be provided without construction, how can we foster small business/NIB/NISH participation.

Suggested Scope:

Contractors shall provide management, consulting, and operational personnel to perform a combination of logistical and support services within government facilities.  Management and operating staff carrying out these support activities are not involved with, or responsible for, the core business of the Federal Agency.  These facility services expressively exclude computer centers as covered under the IT schedule and construction.  Teaming is encouraged with the Guard Services Schedule and Ground Maintenance Schedule when these types of activities are required in conjunction with facilities support services.

The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry to identify existing commercial off the shelf (COTS) systems, or ongoing or planned development efforts for test data modernization studies.  Please see the Statement of Objectives (SOO) below.
The information provided through the responses will be used to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  POINT OF CONTACT: Technical: dwight.fuqua@edwards.af.mil Dwight Fuqua, 412/LG/LGLO Edwards AFB, CA (661) 277-7190 x 2823 or Contracting: Patrick Terry, AFFTC/PKDB Edwards AFB, CA (661) 277-8590 patrick.terry@edwards.af.mil .

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

C-17 Test Information Management System
 
 
C.1.  Purpose.  This document provides the objectives for development and integration of a C-17 Test Data Archive System.  The test team envisions an integrated architecture maximizing the Government's investment to date in information management, data processing, and instrumentation resources.
 
C.2. Scope.  This effort encompasses all classes of information associated with the C-17 Follow-on Flight Test Program (FOFTP), and much of the information from the earlier Full Scale Engineering Development (FSED) program phase. 

Information elements are categorized as either programmatic information  or test data, where:  
 
q	Test Programmatic Information includes Test Plans, Test/Work Requests, and Test Reports; and the supporting documentation such as Class T-2 Aircraft Modification Documentation, Test Parameter Requirements (TPR) documents, and instrumentation configuration load files.  
 
q	Test data is raw and processed flight test data available in engineering unit format.  Information from the C-17 aircraft instrumentation suite, Edwards AFB range and other test range resources, and Boeing Long Beach operations. It includes digital, analog, video, and audio source data items.
 
C.3. Goal.  Government-managed C-17 Test Information Management structure compliant with DOD Directive 5015.2, Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management-Software Applications, and the C-17 Security Classification Guide.

C.4. End-Users.  Two categories of users are provided based on anticipated access demand.

q	High Demand Users: Three primary geographically separated locations: System Program Office at Wright Patterson AFB, OH; Global Reach CTF at Edwards AFB, CA; and Boeing Engineering Operations at Long Beach, CA.
q	Lower Demand Users: Government and Boeing sites on the AFFTC Complex; Sites within the Boeing Long Beach Complex; HQ Air Mobility Command at Scott AFB; Test Team Units deployed at remote locations; and NASA Dryden and Ames Research Centers.

C.5. C-17 FOFTP Objectives.  The C-17 Test Information Management architecture shall satisfy the seven objectives defined by the C-17 Test Integrated Product Team herein.  The technical approach will integrate, to the extent feasible and affordable, each objective.  Solutions proposed may include hardware and software-based upgrades, modification of procedures, and/or any combination of these that clearly integrates each objective area into the C-17 Test Information Management architecture.
 
q	Objective 1: Information Exchange, Users will have the ability to exchange, transmit, and receive, programmatic and test data information elements necessary for mission execution.  The capacity and bandwidth of the C-17 Test Information Management System must simultaneously support all end-users using existing Government internet access.  The System will facilitate the C-17 test business process in a manner that has been approved by the Government to meet information assurance, and security requirements.  
 
q	Objective 2: Information Access. Within the C-17 Test Information Management System, users will have the ability to access and retrieve programmatic and test data information for planning and reporting purposes.  All information will be in digital format (where practical), accessible from engineering workstations with Government Internet access.  Search capability will employ DTIC keyword standards and formats; current and archived information will be accessible using standard Government PC software products (i.e.; MS Office Suite, Adobe, Matlab...etc).  Specialized and tailored products will be available from long-term archives within 24-48 hours; server side processing will be maximized to support data requests within minutes subject to bandwidth restrictions.  Server side processing must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security and assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.  Role-based privileges will provide the necessary security and integrity for the system.
 
Operational Availability and Reliability must exceed 95%;, local and national backup protocols must be in-place to support downtime periods.

Emerging information management concepts, namely "Data Merging" and "Data Mining" are highly desirable attributes if economically achievable within the projected schedule guidelines.
 
q	Objective 3: Data Storage. Within the C-17 Test Information Management System, both test programmatic information and test data must be accessible within stated timelines therefore the architecture must have the capability to retain information in both an "immediately accessible" state, and an archived state for long term access. 

Based on C-17 end-state data management policy; the storage capacity must be readily expandable as further data is collected and legacy information is converted to digital format.  Data storage devices and interfaces must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security and assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.

Concerning long term access to archived data, IRIG Standard Chapter 10 is the solid state recorder standard that defines the use of a common set of playback/data reduction software to take advantage of emerging random access recording media.  Stated therein, digital data acquisition shall be compatible with the multiplexing of both synchronous and asynchronous digital inputs such as Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) and MIL-STD-1553 data bus, time, analog, video, ARINC 429, discrete and RS-232/422 communication data.  The C-17 Test Information Management System seeks to comply, within an acceptable schedule and if proved economically practical and feasible, with this common format standard.

q	Objective 4: Magnetic and Audio/Video Tape Storage Mediums. Within the C-17 Test Information Management System, an on-demand capability to retrieve archived legacy and near term test data from magnetic tape media will be available to support data requests.  Support turn-around time must not exceed 72 hours from date/time of request.  Conversion and storage of all media must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.
 
q	Objective 5: Paper and Still Photo Documentation.  Within the C-17 Test Information Management System, on-demand conversion of C-17 FOFTP and FSED legacy programmatic information and test data to digital format is required.  That data must be accessible as described in Objectives 1-3 above.  Keyword search files will be created in MS Word and/or Adobe PDF formats with links to the referenced documents using DTIC guidelines.  Conversion and storage of all paper products must fully comply with Government Information Technology (IT) security and assurance guidelines as approved by local implementing agencies.
 
q	Objective 6: Standardization of Data Products. Within the C-17 Test Information Management System, a standard data package will be defined and coordinated with managers and engineers for completeness and quality.

q	Objective 7: Instrumentation and Data Processing Support at the Global Reach CTF.  The C-17 Test Information Management System will require integration of many diverse tools, some in use, some being developed.  

AFFTC-wide, Commercial and/or Non-developmental item (CaNDI) software products are being purchased and deployed.  Two examples of CaNDI products are Telelogics DOORSTM and SYNERGYTM software packages respectively employed to track requirements and configuration management plans and issues.  Employment of this class of tools will require integration into C-17 IPT business practices.

The Test Information, Generation, Analysis, and Reporting System (TIGARS) is the  C-17 legacy tool used by managers and engineers.  The user interface for TIGARS is bulky; improvement of this interface is possible using CaNDI software and is a primary sub-objective.

The Flight Test Support Software (FTSS) is being developed by the CTF to improve management and access to the measurands index, historical and current calibration data items, and the Test Parameter Report (TPR) library.  It must interface with the OMEGA database providing seamless update of over 40,000 defined and definable parameters.  Integration of the FTSS-OMEGA packages is a primary sub-objective of this effort.

C.6.  Schedule.  The services provider will provide a detailed schedule.  C-17 FOFTP Schedule Objectives are:

o	FY 2004.  Requirements Definition with parallel Proof-of-Concept Studies; Acquisition, Integration, and Deployment of Tools and Resources;
o	FY 2005.  Integration into the C-17 Business Process.

<SUBJECT>W -- 55 Passenger Coach
<DESC>Marine Forces Reserve (MFR) MFR intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for a follow-on contract to lease a 45-foot, 55-passsenger coach for an 8 month period with (3) six-month option periods.  On December 31, 1998, the Department of Navy, Marine Forces Reserve competed and awarded a five-year (with options) contract to Hausman Bus Sales, Inc (through Motor Coach Industries). The contract expires on January 31, 2004. The contract provides lease of a 1999 MCI model 102DL3, 45 Foot, 55-passenger intercity stock coach 99-47, rear-engine mounted with automatic transmission, storage area in bottom, overhead storage area, television, VCR, reclining seats, high fidelity sound system with compact disk player, cassette player, AM/FM radio, computer port/jack, outlet for cell phone, air conditioning and heat, and lavatory, and screen print of Marine Forces Reserve Band logo.  The Marine Corps has established a contract to provide a replacement for this vehicle but delivery will not occur for 9 to 24 months.  This action necessitates the follow-on period of performance for 8 months with (3) 6-month options, to allow sufficient time for delivery of the new bus. This action will be issued as a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available. Questions concerning this sole source contract may be directed to Caroline Register mailto:registercr@mfr.usmc.mil. The use of any other source for follow-on contract would result in substantial duplication of costs, which is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delay. As the incumbent contractor coach is already equipped with the customized Marine Forces Reserve Band screen print logo, MCI is uniquely situated to provide services during this interim period. It is critical to the missions of MFR that services continue uninterrupted, without loss of functionality, features, or degradation of services while awaiting the delivery of a new bus.  This contract will allow sufficient time for the delivery of the new bus. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation package is available for this requirement; therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses. See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INDUSTRY COMMENTS ON LIABILITY & INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR REMEDIATION SERVICES
<DESC>In preparation for the addition of Remediation Services to the Environmental Services multiple award schedule, the Management Services Center is requesting questions and comments regarding the following liability and insurance clause that will be added to the refreshed solicitation.  This insurance clause will only apply to Remediation Services and the limits of liability are minimums.  The solicitation will also allow ordering agencies to request additional insurance at the task order level, if necessary. All comments shall be in writing.  Clause for review is as follows -
I-FSS-******** Liability and Insurance  (Applicable to SIN 899-8, Remediation Services Only)
(a)	The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) does not become an owner, operator, generator, arranger or transporter of hazardous substances or wastes by executing a schedule contract or by the award of a task order by an ordering agency against a schedule contract for remediation services.  As a result, GSA shall not incur any liability under any environmental laws for contamination resulting from the actions or omissions of a schedule contractor performing remediation services.
(b)	The Contractor shall be liable for, and indemnify and hold harmless the Government against, all actions or claims for loss of or damage to property or the injury or death of persons, resulting from the default, negligence, or wrongful act or omission of the Contractor, its agents, or employees.
(c)	The Contractor shall provide and maintain Contractor Pollution Liability  and Professional Liability with coverage amounts not less than $5,000,000.00 each.  The Contractor is advised that additional levels of insurance coverage may be required  by the Ordering Agency at the Task Order level.
(d)	Immediately after award of a task order under this schedule contract, the Contractor shall notify the ordering agency's Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained and identify specific threshold amounts.  The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the interests of the Government shall not be effective (1) for such period as the laws of the State in which the task order is to be performed prescribe or (2) until 30 days after written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever is longer.  The policies shall exclude any claim by the insurer for subrogation against the Government by reason of any payment under the policies.
