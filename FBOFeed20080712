<p>The 412th TW/EW is Edwards AFB is seeking vendors that specialize in Microwave Tuner electonmagnetic signal collection systems.</p>
<p>The Microwave Tuner is an electronmagnetic signal collection system used to monitor, record, and analyze Radio Frequency (RF) signals during anechoic chamber test, and for signal verification. The main portion of the system is the COMSOL Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) processing system. This system provides detailed analysis of signals collected from 500 MHz to 18 GHz. Captured RF signals can be used to either ensure the proper operation of the Combat Electromagnetic Environment Simulator (CEESIM) or to program advanced waveforms on the CEESIM.</p>
<p>The Microwave Tuner also provides a 160 MHz and 1 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) output to be processed by a Pulse Analyzer Unit (PAU) which is used to measure IF and video signals to extract precise radar signal parameters for use in identification, analysis and emitter location. The Microwave Tuner interacts with a Dual Channel ComSol allowing for data collection in two different frequency bands simultaneously. The options are included to allow expansion of the device's frequency range and to process communication signals.</p>

For the past eight years, SSA purchased operations essential network devices utilized by SSANet and support (design, configuration, installation, and troubleshooting) from Northrop Grumman.

Clean lines of communication and being able to work along with a Contractor knowledgeable of SSA’s network topology and Cisco are at the essence of these services.
