<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation. The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning Metamaterials technology for Radio Frequency (RF) and Electro-Optical (EO) applications. Metamaterials are artificially structured material composites that have been engineered to alter their electromagnetic characteristics, such as index of refraction, or electric and magnetic polarization. These tools, if fully realized, point toward great increases in capability for both RF and optical applications, such as smaller antennas at reduced weight with additional functional bandwidth. Presently, metamaterials and associated technologies are pursued primarily at the basic research level because of the extensive scientific understanding required to utilize their unique properties in practical applications. Possible applications include RF antennas, filters, circulators, and frequency selective surfaces, Optical / IR beam steering, compact optical systems, mirrors, optical circuitry, interconnects, filters and limiters. <br />Technical POC: Dr. Bob Simpson, phone: (937) 255-3802 ext. 3475 e-mail: afrlryDX@wpafb.af.mill, Mail address: AFRL/RYD Attn: Dr. Bob Simpson 2241 Avionics Circle, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR Research on Advanced Non -destructive Evaluation (NDE) Methods for Materials, Processes and Structures. The objective of the program is to conduct on-site research to bridge the the gaps and accelerate the initial development of selected NDE technology to a level of full feasibility demonstration, to conduct studies of the applicability of selected technologies to a wide variety of potential applications, or development of new technologies to address specific needs. Research is comtemplated to address current operational or maintenance needs. Because the nature and make-up of advanced aerospace materials and structures are diverse and complex, a comprehensive planning and execution of NDE research is anticipated. There are numerous well established NDE tools and techniques for use in NDE research. A partial list includes, but is not limited to: eddy current, ultrasound, X-Ray based methods, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, boroscopy, laser based methods, terahertz methods, microwave methods, thermography, shearography, acoustic emission, and on-board monitoring methods. It is envisioned that NDE research will also require advances in the state-of-the-art, necessitating the development of new and unique tools and techniques in addition to the tools and techniques enumerated above. Materials that will be the subject of NDE research may include, but are not limited to, the following materials and their associated composites: aluminum alloys; magnesium alloys; titanium alloys; nickel alloys; steels; refractory metals; advanced intermetallic compounds; niobium alloys; ceramics &ndash; monolithic; high-temperature structural ceramics based on oxides, nitrides, silicides, carbides, and borides; nanocrystalline and/or multi-layered component systems of metallics, intermetallics, ceramics, and organic materials; structural and nonstructural polymers as well as functionally graded materials, electronic materials, sensor materials, coatings and paint materials. Structures that will be the subject of NDE research will be made of the above materials and may include, but are not limited to the following structures: simple plates; multilayered plate structures; plates with attached stiffeners/structure (bonded, fastened, or integral); plates or structures with rough or irregular finishes; or combinations of the previously mentioned structures. Proposals will maximize the research efficiency and demonstrate relevance by: 1) identifying appropriate material systems and components based on their specific inspection deficiencies, 2) identifying and developing an understanding of the limitations of the inspection method including the physics and mechanics of excitation, interaction with the material, and signal processing, 3) developing, adapting or improving techniques to characterize damage precursors, initiation and accumulation under laboratory or simulated component usage conditions, 4) developing or improving analytical models to simulate accurately the interaction of chosen NDE method with degradation, deformation, and failure mechanisms in laboratory or realistic conditions, 5) verifying the accuracy and applicability of the analytical models using experimental data and demonstrating the improvements in material state awareness capability, 6) transitioning the knowledge obtained, models, experimental data, and testing methods/technologies to appropriate Air Force customers, suppliers and the scientific community, and 7) developing enabling technology for material health, on-board or in-situ monitoring. It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) providing more details into this program will be released sometime during the month of March, 2009 and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov. Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are also available at www.fedbizopps.gov. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified above or the Program Manager identified below in the announcement. NOTE: The government anticipates conducting a Lab Tour on 23 Jan 2009. Participation in the tour is limited to U.S. Citizens only; with no more than 3 representatives per company permitted to attend. If you plan to attend the Lab Tour, you must notify Mr. Welter (contact information provided below) no later than the Thursday of the week before the tour and provide him with the attendees&rsquo; names, company, address and phone number. Absolutely no substitutions of representatives after notification deadline will be accepted. The Lab Tour will be conducted at AFRL/RXLP, 2230 10th Street, Building 655, WPAFB, OH, 45433-7817. For additional information related to this Lab Tour, please contact Mr. John Welter at (937) 255-9811, or by e-mail at john.welter@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

Statement of Work

Simultaneous Interpretation
The conference will be conducted in English, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic.  To meet this requirement, DEA needs the services of six (6) Spanish-English simultaneous interpreters, two (2) Arabic-English simultaneous interpreters, and two (2) Russian-English simultaneous interpreters.  All simultaneous interpreters are needed on June 2-4, 2009.

This conference is attended by senior-level drug law enforcement officials from throughout the world, to include ministerial-level delegates.  The conference includes plenary presentations, followed by simultaneous breakout sessions that are conducted in several languages.  These presentations and sessions focus on drug law enforcement operations and utilize technical jargon that must be accurately translated.  As a result, simultaneous interpreters are expected to have advanced knowledge of drug law enforcement terminology.  

Technical Production
In addition, DEA needs a team to oversee the technical production of the conference.  This team, led by a senior manager, will be responsible for directing and monitoring all technical aspects of the conference. The technical production team is needed from May 31 through June 4, 2009. 

The technical production team will include a senior production manager, assistant manager, and any other members you consider necessary to accomplish this task.  The manager and assistant manager will be considered key personnel and their resumes should be included with the quote. 

The technical production team will be responsible for working with the company providing the audiovisual and interpretation equipment and its technicians to ensure coordination and the smooth functioning of the conference. Either the Production Manager or Assistant Production Manager should be fluent in English and Spanish to facilitate smooth coordination and communication.  This team will serve as liaison between DEA and the technicians and is critical to ensure maximum quality control.  This RFQ does not include procurement of the audiovisual and interpretation equipment.  



Type of Contract, FAR PART 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures

The Government contemplates award of a fixed price purchase order resulting from this RFQ.

Basis for Award 

The Government intends to make a single award to the vendor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution, in terms of technical capability, past performance, and price.

The building’s HVAC is managed by Carrier controls.  As such, the vendor must be on the Carrier Southern California Certification Roster for the level of work being described herein.

The office building is a 55,000 square foot building, with the HVAC system consisting of the following major components:

	4 Air Handling Units providing air supply to 4 distinct zones of the building utilizing supply and return fans on each unit
	2 Water Chillers with isolation valves, programmed to handle the entire building load on a rotational basis, with 2 chilled water pumps assigned to each chiller.
	2 Cooling Towers with isolation valves, programmed to handle the entire building load on a rotational basis, with a condensing water pump assigned to each cooling tower.
	2 Cooling Tower Fans, one in each cooling tower.
	2 Hot Water Boilers with isolation valves, programmed to handle the entire building load on a rotational basis, each with a condensing water pump.

As built drawings are available.

The load control system shall be powered at all times by a UPS 120 vac15 amp, to be supplied by the Government.  The load control system must monitor inputs from the Programmable Logic Control and/or Generator to determine generator and building status and load.  The load control system shall make all control decisions based on these inputs. 

The load control system will remain on standby and not operate until the requirements listed below are initiated.  The specific equipment listed above will be operated by the load control system.  All other HVAC related devices, such as damper actuators, valve actuators, economizers, and the like are to be considered negligible loads and allowed to function normally as the related equipment is brought on line.  The sequence of operations shall be designed to accomplish the following objectives:

1.  Prevent all HVAC equipment from restarting at initial loss of utility power.  When the building load is transferred to the generator, the load control system will sequentially provide power to the equipment listed above, with sufficient delays to allow each piece of equipment to reach a stable state.

2.  Insure that Air Handling Units are started in the following order, 1st floor west wing, then 2nd floor north wing, then 2nd floor west wing, and finally 1st floor north wing.

3.  In the sequential process of initiating power to the major HVAC equipment, at no time shall the current exceed 600 amps.  If a piece of essential equipment causes the current to exceed 600 amps, then a command must be initiated to shut down the air handling units in reverse order, starting with 1st floor, north wing. 

4.  If operational loads exceed 650 amps, a similar process in 3 above must be initiated.

5.  When the load control system receives signal that building is off generator power, all HVAC equipment must be stopped by the load control system.  In the event that utility power does not remain on then the load control center must restart the HVAC equipment, it will do so in the same sequence previously described.

6.  When utility company power is restored, the load control system needs to be designed to shut down HVAC loads and transfer control of the equipment to the Energy Management System.  The system also needs to be designed to return control to the load control center should utility power not be sustained for an appropriate default period, on the order of 3 minutes. 

7.  The remote access software program shall be programmed to monitor/operate the overall operation of HVAC system when operating on utility and/or generator power.
Contactor shall also provide a minimum of three extended months of 'I-Vu' monitoring of Gen-set/PLC.
Solicitation package will be available only on FEDBIZOPPS on or about January 6, 2009.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to procure a ground test replacement for the flightspare International Space Station (ISS) Space to Ground Antenna (SGANT) previously in usein the Electronic Systems Test Laboratory (ESTL) for ground testing of InternationalSpace Station Ku-Band communications system components and for resolution of on-orbitanomalies. The ISS Flight Spare SGANT previously used in the ESTL for ground testcapability is being launched for an on-orbit spare.NASA/JSC intends to purchase the replacement antenna from Canadian Commercial Corporationas the prime contractor and MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Corporation (MDA),Information Systems, the original SGANT manufacturer as the subcontractor, pursuant toFAR 6.302-1.The ESTL SGANT Replacement (ESR) antenna is required to have identical RF characteristicsto the flight SGANT antennas.  The ISS Program is upgrading the current Space to GroundSubsystem (SGS), of which the SGANT is one component, via the Obsolescence DrivenAvionics Upgrade (ODAR) Project, increasing the forward and return link data rates to25Mbps and 300Mbps, respectively.  Because the antenna is the limiting factor for theforward and return link data rate increases and is not being upgraded, a functionallyidentical replacement for the SGANT is required for valid test results and riskmitigation to the ISS for the ODAR project, mission anomaly resolution support, andground testing of future modifications to the ISS SGS Communications System.  Inaddition, to avoid redesign of the current antenna mounts and handling fixtures in theESTL, the SGANT replacement must be a form and fit replacement.  The SGANT is a customantenna manufactured by MDA to the ISS Program requirements in document number 10033009International Space Station Program Communications and Tracking Equipment DevelopmentSpecification SGS Antenna Group.  MDA possesses the Radio Frequency (RF) EngineeringFeed, Offset Tool RF Reflector, and the special tooling, processes, and proceduresnecessary to produce and deliver the form, fit, and functionally equivalent ESR antennarequired to ensure the fidelity of ESTL test results. Failure to obtain an identicalreplacement places testing of the ISS ODAR system at risk of obtaining invalid test dataand therefore flying replacement hardware with unproven end-to-end transmissioncapability, places resolution of mission anomalies at risk of being unresolved, andplaces future upgrades to the ISS SGS at risk of invalid test results and flying withunproven capability.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

organ doses from pediatric CT Imaging at the University of Florida; Gainesville,

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This acquisition will be processed in accordance with
simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The
North American Industry Classification System code is 541712 the business size
standard is 500 employees.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Radiation
Epidemiology Branch (REB) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is
currently conducting studies of cancer risk from pediatric Computed Tomography
(CT) imaging.<span>&nbsp; </span>Phase I involves a cohort
study using electronic medical records of patients who had one or more CT-EXPO
scans between 1985 and 2002 at radiology departments in the UK.<span>&nbsp; </span>Feasibility of this study was established via
a pilot study in the Newcastle National Health Service Trust.<span>&nbsp; </span>Phase II is a nested case-control study on
pediatric CT scans and leukemia risk.<span>&nbsp; </span>The goal of the Phase II study is to obtain more individual details on
CT exposure techniques to allow for more precise estimation of the radiation
dose-response effects for leukemia. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Following a detailed
review of available databases on CT organ dose and associated software, the
NCI/DCEG Radiation Epidemiology Branch settled on the CT-EXPO (version 1.6)
computer software for these studies.<span>&nbsp; </span>While based fundamentally on a single Siemens x-ray source, this
software covers most currently used CT scanners through the use of dose scaling
algorithms based on normalized effective dose ratios and/or CTDI ratios
(scanner factor).<span>&nbsp; </span>CT-EXPO provides for
dose estimates for two adult phantoms &ndash; ADAM and EVA stylized anatomic models &ndash;
and two pediatric phantoms &ndash; the BABY and CHILD voxel phantoms.<span>&nbsp; </span>More anatomically realistic voxel-based
phantoms are not provided at the adult ages, and there exists a large age gap
between the 2-month BABY phantom, the 7-year CHILD phantom, and the adult
phantoms.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the two pediatric
phantoms BABY and CHILD are individual-specific and of a format that cannot be
altered to represent individuals of variable height and weight percentiles.<span>&nbsp; </span>Recent advances in hybrid phantom technology
have given the potential to greatly expand the range of patient ages and body
morphometries considered in a dosimetry evaluation of CT imaging exposures.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The purpose of this
procurement is to obtain the services of a contractor experienced in the
assessment of organ-specific radiation doses received from CT scans. Radiation
doses will have to be calculated for a number of organs and for a number of
representative children of various ages as well as for adult males and females.
The dosimetry results will have to be validated by means of experiments. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

date of award.</p>

a companion effort in the construction of physical phantoms for in-vivo
dosimetry.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of these activities are
crucial to the proposed contract requirement.<span>&nbsp; </span>UF is currently responsible for developing pediatric phantoms for the
ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection), with the
implication that these phantoms will be widely used as references, as they will

with the 2007 ICRP recommendations.. UF has a large number of post-docs who can
be expected to deliver the massive amount of work that is required of them in
the PSC on time. This ability of the research team is crucial to providing
experimental validation of internal organ doses delivered during CT imaging of
the pediatric patients. </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Synthesis of Selected Chemical Carcinogens, Derivatives of Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and Chemopreventive Agents
<SOLNBR>N02-CB-81013-48
<RESPDATE>020609
<CONTACT>John R. Manouelian, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-3813, Fax (301) 402-6699, Email manouelj@mail.nih.gov - Richard L Hartmann, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-8620, Fax (301) 402-6699, Email hartmari@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The Cancer Etiology Branch (CEB) of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) has a continuing requirement to provide for the synthesis, isolation, purification, and characterization of a number of different research compounds of interest to the carcinogenesis research community.  A majority of these compounds will be synthesized to replace depleted chemical stocks.  New chemicals may be added to meet scientific researchers’ demand upon approval of the Project Officer.  Chemicals that are currently of interest to the chemical carcinogenesis research community are indicated in the Table at the end of the acquisition plan. Chemicals that have either a low or no demand in the future may be removed from the list.  The contractor will be required to prepare analogs, derivatives and metabolites of compounds within the chemical classes as needed.  Some synthesis will be to replace depleted stocks of chemicals currently carried on the website http://www.NCIRepository.org .

This requirement is part of an ongoing contract research resource collaboration supporting world-side research programs as well as intramural NCI principal investigators.  In the past, over 1,300 chemical carcinogens, chemopreventive agents, chemical biomarkers (DNA and protein adducts), molecular epidemiology standards and chemical metabolites unavailable elsewhere were available for distribution to research through the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards Repository program.  Compounds are shipped world-wide.  The level of purity attained by repository suppliers is on the order of 98+% and is guaranteed.  This level of purity is not always available from commercial sources

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:

•	The Contractor shall prepare compounds by unequivocal methods to produce gram quantities of high purity compounds, which are well-characterized, as specified by the Project Officer;

•	The Contractor shall ship properly characterized compounds to the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository, within 14 calendar days of completion of synthesis, according to labeling, packaging and shipping specifications described in the Statement of Work.  Distribution to the research community will be handled by the NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository Contractor for all compounds.  The Contractor shall be required to provide analytical, handling and storage data with all shipments;

•	The Contractor shall perform synthesis, as directed by the Project Officer and presented in the following categories:  a) Re-synthesis; and b) Syntheses of parent derivatives of other carcinogens.  Overall, the Contractor will synthesize 1-5 compounds per month and provide 1-5 grams of each synthesized compound, as determined and directed by the Project Officer;

•	The Contractor shall perform necessary chemical characterizations and/or re-purification, as requested by the Project Officer.  In addition, the Contractor shall submit a detailed Quality Control Plan which will provide a process to address and resolve any instance where compounds fall beneath the stated acceptable quality levels (as specified by the Project Officer, but generally 99+% purity).  Inspection and acceptance of compounds will be performed at the NCI Repository.  The Contractor shall submit the Quality Control Plan within 60 calendar days after the start date of the contract; the plan will be reviewed for approval by the Project Officer prior to its acceptance;

•	The Contractor shall prepare and submit a Transfer/Phase-Out plan to the Project Officer sixty days prior to the expiration date of the contract, in the event that the project is re-competed and the successor award is not made to the incumbent Contractor.

This is a re-competition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) cost-reimbursement, cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract will be awarded for a period of one (1) base year with the possibility of the Government exercising up to three (3) additional option periods/years.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately on or around January 7, 2008, and proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after the solicitation issue date.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/appl/rfp/published_rfps.jsp .  IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  The NAICS Code is 541380 with a size standard of $12,000,000 per annum.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  Point of contact is John R. Manouelian; electronic mail address:
manouelj@mail.nih.gov ; telephone: 301-435-3813; fax:  301-402-6699.  Collect calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The project is located on the Boadle-Jones Wetlands Reserve Program Easement approximately 25 miles southwest of Choteau, Montana.  The project consists of removing 4 small dams and associated structures, as well as seeding and weed control activities.  Dam embankments and core trenches will be excavated and stockpiled at waste areas by March 15, 2009.  The contractor will be required to snowplow access roads, job sites, and to work with frozen soils as necessary to complete the project.  Between June 30 and September 30, 2009 the contractor will return to the site to spread stockpiled materials on waste areas, begin weed control work, and repair any road damage during construction work.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Wisconsin Water Science Center, Middleton, WI intends to make award on a sole source basis to Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation (MCRF) to analyze water samples from the Menomonee River Watershed in Milwaukee, WI within the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District planning area and directly tributary to the planning area.  Samples will be analyzed for presence of five types of human gastrointestinal viruses.  The contractor will provide analysis, research advisory assistance, and manuscript preparation assistance.
The period of performance for the required services is base period 1 Jan 09 through 31 Dec 09 plus two option periods.
MCRF is the only known source for this requirement because of the testing and evaluation methodology they utilize to analyze the level of inhibition.  They are the only source with the following capabilities:  detection of viruses, quantitation of viruses, identification of specific viruses, and determination of infectivity of viruses.  Viruses will be detected by real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and TaqMan probe.  The level of inhibition to the RT-PCR reactions, due to the elevated level of naturally occurring compounds in stormwater samples, will be evaluated with an internal inhibition control in every sample.  Selected samples that are RT-PCR positive for enteroviruses and adenoviruses will be further analyzed for the number of viable infective virions by cell culture and detecting the negative replicating RNA strand of enteroviruses or mRNA strand of adenoviruses.  They have developed an approved Quality Management Project Plan to analyze samples specifically for these viruses.  Additionally, they have performed identical services under prior contracts; it is imperative that the current analysis be conducted using the same methodology.
The NAICS code is 621511.
In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  However, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS.  No additional synopsis will be published.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).
Any questions or inquiry regarding this announcement may be addressed to Kris Murray via email at kmurray@usgs.gov.
The anticipated award date of the contract is 30 Dec 08.  The awardee must be registered at ccr.gov to be eligible for award.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO FIRMS WITH AN ESTABLISHED WORKING OFFICE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF THE VA GULF COAST VETERANS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, 400 VETERANS AVENUE, BILOXI, MS 39531.THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) CONCERNS.  Offers from other than SDVOSB concerns will not be considered and shall be rejected.  The firm must be SMALL under the applicable North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code, which is 541310 with a size standard of $4.5 million, and the firm must be REGISTERED and CURRENT in the following websites to be eligible for award:http://vip.vetbiz.gov,http://www.ccr.gov, and https://orca.bpn.gov .The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Biloxi, MS, is seeking an architect or architect/engineer firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, the following.Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square floor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.

<DESC>Washington Closure Hanford intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following scope of work. If you have experience in this type of Field Remediation and would like to participate in this RFP process, please contact the Procurement Specialist by the email address above. This procurement will be a small business set aside, under NAICS 562910. A prequalification questionnaire will be issued in January 2009.

 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION FOR 118-K-1 BURIAL GROUND

This work scope is for the remedial actions for the 118-K-1 Burial Ground located in the 100-KR-2 Operable Unit (OU).  The work includes performing remedial construction activities, as well as furnishing necessary facilities, equipment, labor, materials, supplies, and tools.  

A wide range of chemically and/or radiologically contaminated soil, ash, miscellaneous debris, intact containers, buried equipment, soft waste, and structural materials may be encountered during remedial action activities.  This work scope includes performance of operations necessary to excavate, sort, size reduce, stage, containerize/package, load, weigh, maintain, and transport materials from the 118-K-1 Burial Ground.  

In general, the remedial actions for the site may include any of the following:

Perform jobsite walkdowns for planning and preparation of job hazards analyses/work plans,
Perform activities to verify the location and determine the extent of contamination,
Perform excavation/material sorting of soil and debris, drum/container removal and handling, and sampling/inspection support activities in accordance with radiological requirements and using different levels of personal protective equipment,
Remove, process, stockpile, stage, and containerize waste material, stockpile clean material, and support WCH-directed waste characterization,
Transport containers and packaging to the Container Transfer Area, and  
Perform activities to decontaminate equipment exposed to contaminated materials (radiological or chemical).

The 118-K-1 Burial Ground is an inactive solid waste site that operated from 1955 to 1973.  The burial ground is located just outside the east outer perimeter fence of the 100-K Area and consists of numerous trenches, pits, and silos into which radioactive waste was disposed.  The individual trench and pit dimensions vary greatly.  The silos are vertical corrugated culverts.  

The original burial ground was constructed at the same time as the 100-K Area reactors and began receiving waste shortly after the reactors began operation in 1955.  The original burial ground consisted of six silos and a trench.  Reactor hardware was probably buried in the silos, and soft waste (e.g., paper, tape, and cardboard) was probably buried in the trench.  The original burial ground was expanded to the north and south during its operational life.  Trenches and silos were backfilled to grade when the burial ground ceased operation in 1973.    

Remediation of the 118-K-1 Burial Ground was initiated in 2006.  After partial completion, the site was put into a safe shutdown condition in 2008 to focus on higher-risk projects with associated TPA milestones.  WCH is now preparing to resume remediation activities at the site.  The current status of site remediation will be provided in detail in the subsequent Request for Proposal.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for this work will begin in mid-calendar year 2009.

The A-RCI program follows a spiral development model for rapid COTs insertion.  Every even year, the hardware baseline is modified to incorporate new technology via a Technical Insertion (TI).  Every other year (in the odd years) the system software must be modified to accept new Advanced Processor Build (APB) software, which may require firmware and/or hardware changes. The Navy expects to award a contract for this effort in or around mid-2010, wi! th first deliveries in January 2013.  The Navy expects to procure approximately 12 systems per year over a four year period under the base portion of this future contract.  This future contract is anticipated to include a base year, four option years, and the potential to be awarded five additional award term years.  This will be a full and open competition. The Navy intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) by mid 2009.  An Industry Day is anticipated prior to the release of the RFP, where additional information will be provided.  Additional information related to this announcement will be released in the near future.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER (PSC) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of large and small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541690, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreement Program and the community-based Injury Prevention Programs of Federal Tribes funded through that program.  

The Office of Indian Health Service (IHS) has a requirement for a follow-on contract of two years.  IHS seeks a qualified provider (university, corporation, organization…etc) that can monitor, liaison, and is approved to work with the 22 Tribal Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreements located throughout the United States. These Cooperative Agreements are for community-base Injury Prevention Programs and do not address occupational injuries.  The monitoring contractor will provide professional oversight and technical expertise in the best practices in community-based injury prevention program planning, development, implementation, evaluation, training, and resource development to ensure high quality performance in sustaining capacity of the Tribal Injury Prevention programs.  The Cooperative Agreements have just completed the third year of a five-year funding cycle.  The monitoring services will require extensive knowledge of the agreements and the IHS Injury Prevention Program in order to be effective.  Also, the monitoring services will require extensive involvement in culturally sensitive communication, coordination and cooperation in technical oversight.

The objective of the IHS Injury Prevention Infrastructure Cooperative Agreement (CA) funding is to build and sustain Tribal community-based Injury Prevention program capacity.   The funding instrument is a Cooperative Agreement that anticipates substantial involvement (Injury Prevention Application Kit, 2005 CFDA no. 93.284, page 3):

* Between the agency and the recipient
* During performance of the contemplated activity

This differs from a grant that has no involvement from the Federal agency. 

PURPOSE:

The mission of the IHS, in partnership with American Indian and Alaskan Native people, is to raise their physical, mental, social and spiritual health to the highest level; to ensure that comprehensive culturally acceptable personal and public health services are available and accessible to all American Indian and Alaskan Native people; and to uphold the Federal Government’s obligation to promote healthy American Indian and Alaskan Native people, communities and cultures and to honor and protect the inherent sovereign rights of Tribes.

In Sept 2005, Indian Health Service Injury Prevention Tribal Infrastructure Cooperative Agreement Program awarded 22 Tribal groups funding for five-years. This monitoring contract will provide oversight and technical assistance to the 22 Tribal Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreement grantees during the final two years of these funding agreements.

Indian Health Service Project Officers – A local project officer (PO) is assigned to each Tribal Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreement grantee. The project officers (PO) are Indian Health Service Injury Prevention Specialists or Environmental Health Officers working with the local Indian Health Service area.  They are responsible for assisting grantees with scientific, technical and programmatic questions from the grantee.  

Consultation with IHS Staff   The monitor contractor will consult with the project officer through conference calls, site visits, training and at the annual meetings.  The monitor contractor serves to provide technical assistance, advice, or guidance to the IHS project officer to ensure the optimal performance of the Tribal Cooperative Agreement Programs. 

Consultation with IHS Injury Prevention Manager – The contractor will schedule monthly conference calls with IHS Injury Prevention Manager in consultation on activities, accomplishments, challenges, and recommended solutions of the IHS IP Cooperative Agreement (CA) programs. Consultation will also include:

participation at annual IHS Injury Prevention Program meeting
report on monitoring activities, i.e., conference calls, site visits, training
Cooperative Agreement program needs, barriers, and successes
provide assistance in meeting planning and facilitation
national presentations and publications pertaining to the IP CA programs
newsletter articles

<DESC>The Mines, Demolition, and Grenades office of the Rock Island Contracting Center is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources interested in the manufacture of the complete M67 Fragmentation Grenade.  The M67 Fragmentation Grenade is used to supplement small arms fire in close combat situations.  The grenade produces casualties by high velocity projection of fragments in a uniform pattern when detonated.  The M67 utilizes a steel spherical body, filled with high explosives that are initiated by a pyrotechnic delay fuze.  This device is comprised of three (3) major components.  They are, 1) the metal body, 2) a pyrotechnic delay detonating fuze, and 3) the Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) of the explosive composition and the components into the final assembly.  A recent change to the M67 is the addition of a confidence clip. The clip is a stamped metal part that is assembled between the fuze and the grenade body, aiding in the prevention of accidental removal of the pull ring.  It is not, however, considered a safety feature.  Due to the addition of the Confidence Clip to the M213 fuze, the safety pin on the fuze is lengthened by approximately 0.100.<BR><BR>The technical description of this item is identified as: Grenade, Hand, Fragmentation, Delay, M67, NSN 1330-00-133-8244, and PN 9235492.  The NAICS code for this item is 332993 with a business size standard of 1,500 employees.  Please indicate your business size in your response.  Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and price and availability, i.e., estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities, the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for production, and required lead time after date of award based on approximately 60K units per month.  A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in the explosives processing industry.  A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture this fragmentation grenade.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet this criteria.  Information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to: Rock Island Contracting Center, ATTN:  CCRC-AM, Stephanie Migawa, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Il 61299-8000.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.<BR>

<DESC>5180-01-395-2090 Aircraft Maintenance Tool Kit

Brand Name Justification for Intent to Sole Source

The General Services Administration (GSA), Heartland Global Supply Center, FAS, intends to award a sole source order to Engenetics Technologies of 4270 Gibson Drive, Tipp City, OH, based on the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) for the following NSN: 5180-01-395-2090.  This NSN is written in accordance with a brand name part number.  GSA has determined that this brand name part number is the only item that will meet the requirements of this NSN.  GSA manages this NSN and procures this NSN on behalf of our customers.  Brand name justification as follows:

NSN 5180-01-395-2090 is a brand name item, written in accordance with Enginetics Technologies INC part number 140151.  Enginetics Technologies Inc. is the sole manufacturer for this Aircraft Maintenance Tool Kit, which is used on the AH-64 attack helicopter to stake various sizes of bearings in place.  The purpose of the subject tool kit is to stake anti-friction bearings into associated rod ends, bellcranks, supports and other components during assembly, overhaul and repair of AH-64 A/D helicopters.  Without the staking tool, the cost burden on the user is increased and the maintenance down time is lengthened.  Also, without the staking tool, the AH-64A/D Apache Attack helicopter experiences drastic reduction in flight safety, mission function capabilities and readiness.

The above paragraph outlines and justifies this brand name item in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), 13.106-1(b)(3), 5.102(a)(6) and 11.105(a)(3).  Since the anticipated cost is under the simplified acquisition threshold, FAR 13.106-(b)(2), 13.5 and 6.302-1(c) do not apply.

This is not a solicitation or request for quote.  

The GSA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the government’s best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to Marianne Schrik/Contract  Specialist at  Marianne.schrik@gsa.gov,  no later than Dec 29, 2008 5 p.m.  The determination to not compete this requirement is at the discretion of the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)NASA is currently developing the propulsion system concepts for future explorationmissions including a near term human return to the lunar surface. Studies have identifiedhigh performance, non-toxic, cryogenic methane (LCH4) and oxygen (LO2) as a propellantcombination for consideration for the main and reaction control system (RCS) lunarsurface ascent propulsion system. LDAC-1, a NASA study, depicted a lunar ascent vehicleconcept consisting of two sets of spherical propellant tanks, each set containing anoxidizer tank and a fuel tank and located diametrically opposite on either side of thecrew ascent cabin. The spherical oxidizer and fuel tank sets contained the propellant forthe main ascent engine and the RCS engines required for lunar orbit maneuvering anddocking with the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). The concept assumed the use of pressurefed main and RCS engines operating at approximately 350 psia. Two sets of sphericalpropellant tanks were selected for maintaining a controlled center of gravity (CG) forthe lunar ascent vehicle. For a lunar outpost exploration mission at the lunar South Pole, NASA has planned asurface stay duration of approximately 210 days for the crew habitat and lunar surfaceascent stage. NASA system trade studies have shown that LCH4 ascent stage propellant tankfluid venting can be eliminated on the lunar surface for the 210 day mission with1.A passive Multi-layer Insulation (MLI) system consisting of approximately 60 layers toprotect the propellant tanks from the lunar surface and solar environmental heating;2.Loading the LCH4 propellant tanks with densified LCH4 at 165 oR and starting with atank ullege of approximately 15% at the KSC launch pad.In order to verify the trade study results, a NASA inter-Center team consisting of AmesResearch Center (ARC), Glenn Research Center (GRC), Kennedy Space Center (KSC) andMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has proposed a series of baseline passive thermalcontrol technology tests of a flight-representative, spherical LCH4 ascent stagepropellant tank in a simulated lunar thermal environment at the GRC Creek Road CryogenicComplex, SMiRF facility. This activity is sponsored by the NASA Cryogenic FluidManagement (CFM) Project Office.The primary objectives of the planned test series are: 1. To demonstrate the viability of a LCH4-LO2 ascent stage for the given lunar surfacethermal environments and mission duration. This requires a reliable, high performancepassive thermal isolation system conforming to the constraints outlined in the followingsection.2. To provide a testing platform for lunar surface thermal control techniques, includingin-tank equipment and instrumentation. Modification of the in-tank hardware will requireperiodic disassembly and reassembly of the MLI system. In order to enable directcomparisons of test data before and after modifications, this procedure must beaccomplished with minimal effect on overall MLI performance.3. To establish a well-defined set of baseline measurements for comparison with MLI modelpredictions, including the performance-lowering effects of penetrations and seams (forwhich reliable correlations are lacking). Proper instrumentation (primarily thermometry)of the MLI system is therefore imperative. The ultimate goal is to minimize uncertaintyin MLI performance prediction.This RFI seeks to determine whether these objectives are feasible using currenttechniques and commercially available materials.The following list summarizes the salient features and constraints of the NASA testhardware and test facility to which the MLI supplier must conform. 1.The spherical test tank will not be part of the solicitation. It will be GFE. Itsdesign is complete and fabrication drawings are available.2.The anticipated delivery date of the test tank to GRC is no later than April 1, 2009.If necessary, the test tank could be shipped to the selected contractor for MLIinstallation after June 1, 2009.3.The test tank material is 304 stainless steel, with a surface area of 7239 in2, and anominal 48 inch diameter.4.The thickness of the MLI system shall be no greater than 4 inches, as that is theclearance between the tank wall and the cryo-shroud.5.The MLI system shall consist of 60 shield/spacer layers.6.With the cryo-shroud at 700 oR (its maximum attainable temperature), the total heatleak through the (evacuated) MLI assembly (including degradations due to supports, tankpenetrations, seams, etc., but not including conduction heat leaks through supports,penetrations, instrumentation wiring) shall not exceed 1 W.7.Two circular man-way covers are located at the top and bottom of the test tank. The MLIsystem shall be designed to allow for ready access to the man-ways. The MLI system musttherefore be at least partially removable and replaceable, with minimal degradation inperformance.8.Both man-way covers have piping penetrations that are representative of the flight tankand must be accommodated by the MLI design.9.The test tank has two independent support methods: For testing, the tank will be suspended from the vacuum chamber lid by three rodsthreaded into the tank structure. The MLI system must accommodate the support rods.For test preparation outside the vacuum chamber, the tank is to be rigidly held usingtwo removable support brackets, located 180 degrees apart on the tanks equator. The MLIsystem must be removable/replaceable, with minimal degradation in performance, at leastover the two support bracket mounting flats.10.The simulated lunar thermal environment mentioned above is a vacuum chamber with anominal vacuum level 10-6 torr and a nitrogen-cooled cryo-shroud with top, cylindrical,and bottom sections, with an adjustable temperature range from 200 oR to 700 oR. Theinner surface of the shroud is coated with black paint.11.For thermal characterization of the MLI system, the test facility can accommodate upto a maximum of 70 thermocouples.A Request for Proposal for the design, fabrication and installation of a robust,predictable, low heat leak, tank-applied MLI system is anticipated to be released inearly February 2009, with an anticipated contract award date is March 20 and completionin mid-July, 2009.Prior to completing the statement of work, NASA hereby solicits information from MLIindustry sources regarding industry experiences, current capabilities, and/or knowledgeof flight-applicable state-of-the-art approaches to any or all of the following relevantareas:1.Thick MLI assemblies (50 or more layers);2.Design, fabrication and assembly techniques appropriate for spherical tanks (e.g.,interleaved gore sections, overlapping sub-blanket assemblies;3.Accommodation of tank supports and penetrations with minimal impact on MLI systemperformance;4.Reliability and reproducibility of MLI assembly procedures;5.Reproducibility of MLI performance with repeated disassembly/reassembly;6.Tank attachment techniques;7.Inter-layer attachment methods (e.g., tape, Velcro, stitching, bonding);8.Inter-layer spacing techniques and materials for minimizing conduction heat-leak;9.Strength and optical properties of commercially available outer coverings (e.g., Teflonfabric);10.High emissivity materials (e.g., metalized mylar or kapton);11.Materials handling and assembly procedures for minimizing contamination (e.g.,emissivity degradation);12.Optimization of constant or variable layer density;13.Interstitial gas venting techniques (e.g., perforations);14.Performance prediction, modeling, and analysis of MLI systems;15.Performance verification instrumentation (e.g., measurement of temperature profiles,interstitial pressure);16.Expected variation of key performance-impacting properties (especially emissivity) incommercially available materials;17.Quality assurance and acceptance criteria for commercially procured materials orassemblies; and,18.Other factors that might impact MLI system performance or performance predictability.Responses to the RFI should also include; rough order of magnitude cost and scheduleestimates; a company profile, including in-house facilities, experience of key personnel,and business size status; and a summary of previous designs for similar applications orflight systems, along with overviews of performance data.All responses should be submitted electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF), witha practical size limit of 6 MB, via email.  The due date for responses is Jan. 9, 2009.FAR 52-215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitationor to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under othercontracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the FederalAcquisition Regulation.

This contract extension will provide for instructional support in the Groton, CT area for the Security Reaction Forces-Basic (SRF-B) and the Security Reaction Forces-Advanced (SRF-A) course on a turn-key basis, with the contractor providing all instructors, course materials, equipment and facilities. This contract modification will extend the period of performance for these courses from 31 January 2009 until 31 July 2009.  Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would create substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short term extension of services.  The SRF-B training will provide Navy personnel the fundamentals of watch standing and the use of weapons.  The SRF-A course will provide personnel assigned to a security reaction force team the training and education for the prevention of threats, whether from the pier, small boat, or any other means from penetrating a unit in accordance with current naval directives under normal and emergency conditions.  

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A), states services may be deemed to be available only from one responsible source when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Ayana Graham at ayana.graham@navy.mil or call 407-380-4012.  Responses to this notice must be submitted by 6 January 2009.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future competition.

The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Greg Sinsel, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed below. No collect calls will be accepted.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2. The BOP, Office of Information Systems has a requirement to design, engineer, and implement a solution to support the agency's requirement to change the User ID naming structure for all current GroupWise, eDirectory, and file systems home accounts. The estimated value of this acquisition is estimated at $75,000.00. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, it is determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The BOP Office of Information Systems has a requirement to design, engineer, and implement a solution to support the agency's requirement to change the User ID naming structure for all current GroupWise, eDIrectory, and file systems home accounts. The naming structure change is necessary for the final implementation of the GroupWise archiving system. The agency's current naming structure will not function within the GW Archiving system currently being implemented by the BOP. The new naming structure required by the BOP must operate within the GW Archive system. The vendor currently implementing the GW Archive systems, Messaging Architects, owns the proprietary rights to the GW Archive system and has not authorized other vendors access to the GW Archive system source code. Access to this coding is necessary to ensure the new naming structure will operate within the GW Archive system. Therefore, competition could not be obtained for this requirement. A review of the proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer. Based on the submittal from the vendor and a comparison of current and historical acquisition data for similar services, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government. The Contracting Officer has made the determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable. In accordance with FAR 10.001, Market Research was conducted by both the requiring activity and the Contracting Officer. It has been determined that to not rename the GroupWise User ID naming structure would be detrimental to the BOP, as the BOP would be unable to implement the GW Archive backup system for agency generated emails. Contracting Officer's Certification - I hereby certify this request for Justification and Approval of Other than Full Competition is made in good faith, the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement. I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advance planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.

Compatibility with existing software/hardware environment:  In order to maintain and develop successfully the test/development environment must exactly match the production evnrionment.  The DBMS mid-tier test/development server is located at DFAS TSO Indianapolis.  The production server is located at DECC Ogden.  At the moment both environments do exactly match.  Both environments use MicroFocus COBOL as part of the DBMS system.  However, the production server is being replaced by the DECC with a new Itanium server.  This requires a version of MicroFocus COBOL compatible with the new Central Processor Unit (CPU) chipset and microcode.  DECC Ogden has already procured their new copy of MicroFocus COBOL for the new production server.  DFAS TSO Indianapolis must now configure a new Itanium server for the DBMS test/development environment and this requires a matching version of MicroFocus COBOL compatible with the new CPU chipset and microcode.  There is no known competing product that can substitute the MicroFocus COBOL.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives' (OTI) Initial Governance Response Program (IGRP) assists the Government of Colombia (GOC) to stabilize areas recently retaken from insurgent forces by promoting government presence and responsiveness to local needs. OTI's main government partner is the Center for Coordination of Integrated Action (CCAI by its Spanish acronym), which is part of the Office of the President and is responsible for coordinating the establishment of government services in 12 prioritized parts of the country. All OTI project activities are carried out in the name of Acción Social, the partner organization for CCAI. Through the promotion of Acción Social's presence, the program strengthens the credibility and legitimacy of the GOC in post-conflict areas; increases the willingness and capacity of communities to cooperate and interact with the GOC; and improves the GOC's capacity to respond to community-prioritized necessities, including efforts to increase economic opportunities, in a timely and credible manner.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Country Representative - Colombia.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This is a middle management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition.  The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem-solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants.  S/he should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships.  S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders.  Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.  

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Team and will be based in Bogota, Colombia.  

The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:

•	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;

•	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups—many of which have not previously had international funding;

•	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;

•	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;

•	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;

•	Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;

•	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;

•	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI’s program objectives;

•	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting country representative in his/her absence, for example;

•	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required; and,

•	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT:  Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) 4 Ft Fall Protection Initiative.  There is no solicitation number or Request for Proposal (RFP) number available at this time.  Air Force Materiel Command depot maintenance facilities currently provide worker fall protection at heights of ten feet and above. AFMC is considering reconfiguring all depot maintenance operations to provide a safe working height of four feet and above.  The scope of this effort will include at least four depot maintenance locations within the United States (Warner-Robins ALC, GA; Ogden ALC, UT; Oklahoma City ALC, OK; and the 309 AMARG, Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ.)  It is anticipated that a myriad of off-the-shelf and specialized equipment will be necessary. Additionally, modifications to existing infrastructure may be required. An initial industry opportunity to meet with cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and intent of the AFMC 4 ft Fall Protection Initiative is scheduled for 27  29 January 2009 at the Warner-Robins Air Logistics Center, Warner-Robins AFB, GA. Contractors will be given a descriptive briefing of the AFMC 4 Ft Fall Protection Initiative on 27 January 2009 and the opportunity to discuss their understanding of the initiative during the government presentation and a follow-on Question and Answer session.  Contractors may also schedule one-on-one discussions with government representatives on 27-29 January 2009 by contacting Chris Bucher at the telephone number referenced below.   Contractors will be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms in the form of White Papers/Background Papers.  These papers should include contractor general capabilities and concepts that may be of interest to the government and should be submitted electronically to Chris Bucher no later than 20 February 2009.  Papers containing competition sensitive information should be marked "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" wherever applicable. Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected by the government from disclosure.  The Industry Day and White Papers will be considered an initial step in establishing industry understanding of the AFMC 4 Ft Fall Protection Initiative and to allow the government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the initiative.

Participation in this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be compensated.  This is not a Request for Proposal.

<DESC><p>In keeping with our ISO 14000 certification, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) Western Currency Facility (WCF), located at 9000 Blue Mound Road, Fort Worth, TX 76131-3304 has need for a new Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO). The BEP is now issuing this Request for Quotation.</p>
<p>Offerors must submit 1 signed original and 3 copies of their&nbsp;quotations with one electronic copy on CD to Donald Baron, Contract Specialist, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Office of Acquisitions, Room 705-A, 14th and C Sts. SW., Washington, DC 20228 by close of business on January 15, 2009. All pricing will be contained in a&nbsp;Section B of the proposal.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that all offerors attend the site visit to be held at 2:00 PM on Wednesday January 7, 2009 at the WCF. It is suggested that you arrive 30 minutes early in order to clear Security. Attendees must register via e-mail to donald.baron@bep.treas.gov no later than 12 noon on Tuesday, January 6, 2009.</p>
<p>Quotations&nbsp;shall include, at a minimum:<br />&bull; Product description and literature for the RTO and Control Structure.<br />&bull; Explanation of how product best meets the BEP Statement of Need.<br />&bull; Pre-installation guide.<br />&bull; Estimated energy costs.<br />&bull; Spare parts specifications with commercial availability.<br />&bull; Warranties<br />&bull; List of Key Employees with resumes.<br />&bull; Three (minimum) references<br />&bull; Completion of FAR 52.212 Representations and Certifications (See Attachment III)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD<br />The BEP intends to select the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The offeror's proposal must conform to all solicitation requirements including the completion of Attachment III, FAR 52.212 Representations and Certifications to be considered for award. <br />In evaluating and selecting offerors for award, the Government may award the contract to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors contained in the RFQ. <br />The Government intends to award one prime contract under this solicitation. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted, availability of funds and stability of requirements.<br />1. NON-PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS <br />The non-price factors that will be used to evaluate offeror proposals are listed below. The non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than the price factor. They are listed in descending order of importance. The relative order of importance of the non-price factors are as follows: The Technical Approach factor is more important than the Management Approach factor. The Management Approach factor is more important than Past Performance Factor.</p>
<p>As part of the assessment of the non-price factors, the Government will evaluate proposal confidence. Proposal confidence considers the level of confidence the government has in the offeror's proposed approach to achieve contract cost, schedule and performance objectives.</p>
<p>1.1. TECHNICAL APPROACH <br />The BEP will evaluate the soundness, credibility, quality and affordability of the offeror's approach for execution of the project including expected energy consumption for running the system as described in the Statement of Need.<br /><br />2.1 MANAGEMENT APPROACH<br />The BEP will evaluate the project plan, delivery, project timetable, and pre-installation guide to be included with proposal. The resumes of Key Project Managers will be evaluated in order to determine the skill level of the proposed team in satisfying the project requirement. The key personnel are, at a minimum, Project Manager, Field Engineer, and in-house Customer Service Account Manager. Commercial availability of spare parts, as well as coverage detail of warranties will also be considered. These evaluations will ascertain how efficiently the Statement of Need can be satisfied using high quality supplies and services that will meet all regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>3.1 PAST PERFORMANCE <br />The BEP will evaluate past performance of the offeror previous and current "relevant" contract efforts. "Relevant" is defined as government or commercial contracts of similar size or scope. With regard to past performance, the term "offeror" includes the prime contractor, subcontractors and/or teammates. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves to the right to not only assess past performance data provided by the offerors, but also any other relevant information gathered from other sources. Offerors will supply the BEP with at least three references of comparable size or scope for evaluation as part of their proposal.<br />The Government's evaluation of Past Performance will include an assessment, as applicable, of the offeror's record of performance on relevant efforts in the following areas: product performance, meeting of expectations, delivery, installation, product support, service support and parts availability.</p>
<p>4.1 PRICING<br />Price will be assessed for Completeness, Reasonableness and Affordability. Price will not be given a specific rating, but will be evaluated to determine whether the offer is fair and reasonable.</p>

<DESC>Please note the modified language in paragraph one.

The Defense Security Service (DSS) plans to award a firm fixed price level of effort contract for counterintelligence analyst services.  The award will be for a base year with options for increased level of effort and for additional analyst positions.  DSS intends to make award not later than January 30, 2009.   The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541990.  This requirement is a small business set aside.

The proposed acquisition is for seven counterintelligence analysts to provide technical and analytical intelligence/counterintelligence support to supplement the DSS Counterintelligence Office federal workforce.  Work will include analyzing and evaluating raw data collected from established sources to produce finished intelligence on geographic or functional areas, identification of intelligence gaps in collecting information and making recommendations for corrective action.  Contractor employees must have a top secret/SCI clearance prior to beginning work on the contract.  The place of performance for this contract will be at DSS headquarters in Alexandria, VA, Columbus, Ohio and Linthicum Md.  However, due to the agency’s anticipated BRAC moves, these locations will change, respectively, to Quantico, VA, Fort Meade, Md. and Quantico VA sometime in 2011.  DSS will make award to the responsible offeror who conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government. 

Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to doing business with DSS.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please visit www.ccr.gov.  

Interested offerors may submit a request for the solicitation to Karen.Oettinger@dss.mil by referencing solicitation number HS0021-09-P-0004.  Telephone inquiries will not be entertained.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.

<ARCHDATE>03312009
<CONTACT>Michael King, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-09-02@ugov.gov
<DESC><p>DESCRIPTION: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking proposals for innovative research and technology demonstrations for Biometrics Exploitation Science and Technology (BEST) to significantly advance the state of the science and enable revolutionary advances in algorithms, devices, and/or systems for non-contact biometrics.</p>
<p>A Proposer's Day will be held on 15 January 2009, 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, at the MITRE 1 Auditorium (7525 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA) to present the upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). A final BAA will follow Proposer's Day. Pre-registration for Proposer's Day is required via the website at http://conference.brtrc.com/best09/. Attendees are limited to a maximum of two representatives per company, organization or institution.</p>
<p>The BEST program consists of two main thrusts: (1) Exploitation and Analysis and (2) Robust Acquisition.</p>
<p>The Exploitation and Analysis research thrust is composed of three tracks which bound the biometric signatures of interest for this solicitation: 1) face recognition, 2) ocular recognition (i.e. iris recognition with proximal skin texture), and 3) speaker recognition. The thrust seeks to investigate techniques to derive and exploit biometric signatures from data collected under relaxed acquisition constraints while maintaining recognition performance similar to data acquired under controlled conditions. Given that data may originate from a variety of sources, techniques must operate without prior knowledge regarding characteristics of the sensor used during the acquisition.</p>
<p>The Robust Acquisition research thrust seeks to relax the constraints to enable the collection of high fidelity (1) 3D face (shape and texture) and (2) coupled face and ocular biometric features at standoff distance under uncontrolled acquisition conditions to enable the broader application of the technology. Representative acquisition constraints to be relaxed include, but are not limited to, subject motion, relative position to the sensor, and environmental influences. The minimum objective is to exceed by a factor of three what is commercially available today, with recognition performance similar to that achieved with the cooperative or conditioned individual under controlled acquisition.</p>
<p>Specifically excluded from this solicitation are contact-type biometric technologies, such as fingerprint, palm, etc., and proposals for product development or research that would primarily result in incremental, evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.</p>
<p>The goals of this Proposer's Day are to 1) familiarize participants with IARPA's interest in biometrics technologies; 2) promote an understanding of the BAA proposal submission requirements and process; and 3) foster discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: If interested in attending industry day, please visit the registration website (http://conference.brtrc.com/best09/) and complete the form necessary to request an invitation. Non-US citizens are required to fill out a visit request form for Foreign Nationals. The registration deadline is 07 January 2009. If approved, you will be sent an invitation to attend.</p>
<p>INVITED INFORMATION: Attendees may hand out background materials regarding potential technology that may be applicable at the industry day during networking sessions. All handout materials must be unclassified and approved in advance by the organization that funded the research. No proprietary information should be included.</p>
<p>ADMINSTRATIVE POINT OF CONTACT: Ms. Virginia Hoover (Contractor), BEST09 Proposer's Day Liaison, vhoover@brtrc.com.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT: Dr. Michael King, IARPA Program Manager, <br />dni-iarpa-baa-09-02@ugov.gov</p>

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Advanced Initiative Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks in the Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David L. Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training Complexes:<BR>AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas.  AIT Complexes are designed as training facilities.  AIT Complexes will be programmed as a unit, rather than as individual facilities as the complete battalion drives the overall functionality of the facility.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) Barracks, Brigade Complex 2, Phase 3, Fort Drum, Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Mr. Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at Errette.J.Slick@usace.army.mil  <BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH):<BR><BR>UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room shall include, but not be limited to:  private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom, kitchenette, laundry facilities, and other amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for this facility will be:  building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Single Phase Design Build Process.  Interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) will submit certain specified performance capability information, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability information in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation.  <BR><BR>Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the proposals, in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering past performance, technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Volume I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Volume II - DESIGN TECHNICAL: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design, and Sustainability.  Volume III - REMAINING PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY AND SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION:  Remaining Performance Capability; Proposed Task Order Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR><BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 9 Jan 2009 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0013.  Proposals are anticipated to be due approximately on or about  23 Feb 09.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.  This solicitation will be issued as unrestricted.     <BR><BR>MATOC: The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $420,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $100,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.

<DESC>Justification and Approval forBrand Name Procurement1.	Requesting Agency:	Department of Veterans Affairs					VA Medical Center, Bldg 40					Tuscaloosa, AL  35404	Contracting activity:	Department of Veterans AffairsAustin Information Technology Center					IT Acquisition Center					1615 Woodward Street					Austin, TX 787722.	Nature and/or description of the action: This is a Name Brand Source Justification and Approval for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to procure database and associated software licenses, maintenance and support for VA's Fee Basis Claims Software (FBCS). The award will be made against the NASA SEWP IV (Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement) GWAC (Government-Wide Acquisition Contract). The objective of this order is to procure the Fee Basis Claims Software (FBCS) solution for the 34 VA sites that are currently using the FBCS software.  FBCS has a proven record of improving Fee Basis claims management and adjudication.  It allows VA to communicate efficiently with the vendors and veterans about the adjudication status of their claims by providing a complete audit trail for each claim.FBCS allows Fee Claims processing departments to manage and process Fee claims in an electronic environment which improves the ability to keep track of claims in process and to identify duplicate and non-compliant claims.  In addition this product improves the ability to report on Fee expenditures and improves accuracy and consistency of Fee authorizations. FBCS provides the ability to monitor individual and department productivity.  It allows VA to communicate efficiently with the vendors and veterans about the adjudication status of their claims by providing a complete audit trail for each claim.In addition, there has been a significant work effort by the sites to test the critical VistA write-back functionality which is a key component to the efficacy of the software.  Numerous months have been spent testing these capabilities, which are truly enhancing the process.  Without these capabilities, the duplication of data entry would cause inherent data integrity issues.  Introduction of a new product, with the many months of testing required would force sites currently utilizing the software, to re-review all business processes and significantly impact our ability to process these large amounts of claims in a timely manner.  Testing of a new product would involve business, technical and security staff - all already stretched very thin in these field based operational environments.  Business processes have been developed to support the streamlined process this product provides to the program.  Sites with the product currently process approximately 200,000 claims each month.  It is estimated that the processing time utilizing the FBCS COTS product is approximately 75% more efficient than the manual process. The significant impact to sites with such high claims submissions cannot be overstated.  Timely and accurate claims processing has a direct impact to veterans, with delinquent claims processing being the single biggest complaint in the Fee Program.  The cost and required time to develop software with the same functionality as FBCS is prohibitive.  This would cause an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the VA's requirement.   This procurement is a short term solution until the competed interim solution is awarded.  The long term solution will take into consideration the interim solution's approach. It would not be reasonable for the Government to attempt the use of a different product at this time due to substantial duplication of costs for a COTS product that will interact with the Vista products, training, and unacceptable delays.3.	 A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): VA intends to acquire FBCS brand-name database server software to support the Fee Basis program.  The estimated lifecycle value of the procurement is $4,887,005.88.  This is a 1 year (12 month) order period with no option years. The period of Performance is January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2009.The following is a list of the FBCS software licenses, maintenance and support services VA will be acquiring:CLIN SCHEDULE FOR FEE BASIS CLAIMS SYSTEMCLIN	Description	QTY	Unit Price	Extended Amt.0001	Fee Basis Claims System Annual Site License Fee.

Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.FAR 11.105(a)(2)(i), items peculiar to one manufacturer also applies.5.	Demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.    The Department of Veterans Affairs, Information Technology Acquisition Center plans to purchase FBCS Software on a limited source basis in support of the 34 VA sites that currently utilize the software.Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS) is designed to improve Fee Basis claims management and adjudication. Modularly designed, it brings efficiencies to the processing of claims as well as provides a knowledge base of information needed to strategically guide the decisions made about Non-VA care. The FBCS software has a unique feature that entails a very close link to the VistA products.  This feature allows the tool to account for "VA specific" data elements that are an integral component of eligibility determinations when claims are submitted.  Without this link, manual processing would be required.   FBCS is highly specialized and facilitates:1.	Improved Payment Processing Time, 2.	Simplified management and tracking of Fee Basis claims processing activity 3.	Reduced manual data entry, 4.	Standardized, repeatable processing of claims through automated scrubbing and letter generation etc., 5.	Superior intelligence needed to make good business decisions and, reduced Fee expenditures.                                                                                                      6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.This Justification for other than full an open competition was published on FedBizOpps from 12.12.08 - 12.18.08.  This requirement will be competed as a small business set-aside under the NASA SEWP IV contract.7.	Determination that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.The order will be procured off the VA's mandatory source of supplies NASA  SEWP IV.  SEWP IV pricing will apply and a task order will be issued against an existing SEWP IV contract.  The award will be Firm, Fixed-Price.  In addition, the prices offered by the SEWP IV Vendors will be compared to prices offered in the open market to ensure they are fair and reasonable.8.  A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.     An RFI (VA-200-09-RP-0017) was issued on October 20, 2008 which closed      October 31, 2008.  The responses received to the RFI along with internet searches of similar software products demonstrated the number of sources available and their socio-economic status. By analyzing all of the data Nineteen (19) contractors responded, only four (4) were determined to have the capabilities of fulfilling the requirement.  This was established by a thorough analysis of all of the information submitted.  The research also indicates that at the present time, DSS, Inc. is the only responsible source to provide DSS FBCS software that meets the VA's immediate needs.  DSS's sofware is unique - it is the only one that has been tested and accepted and will specifically work with VA's VistA system.  No other software will currently meet VA requirements.  9.	Facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.This procurement constitutes a one year period of performance (PoP) to support some of the contract line items (CLINs).  However, the majority of CLINs under this order will have PoPs of less than one year-when the PoP ends these CLINs will be transferred to an interim competed order (see paragraph 11 below). 10.  List of sources that expressed an interest in the acquisition.To be determined.11.	Actions taken to remove barriers to competition before an subsequent acquisition for the supplies required. The Chief Business Office (CBO) is currently searching for an acceptable, long-term, business model.  Their review will include studying the gambit of business opportunities.  CBO plans to consider all sources for COTS software as well as considering the possibility of hiring VA staff to develop and implement an IT solution.  The new business model will include complete review/testing, equipment and other infrastructure costs.  In the interim, an ongoing procurement entitled "VHA Chief Business Office Purchased Care Health Care Claims Processing" is being set aside and competed amongst Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  The procurement has a base year and three one-year option periods.   The anticipated award date is April 2009.This Brand Name FBCS procurement is for 1 year which should provide adequate time to find a longer term solution to VA's requirements.  It is anticipated that a new solution with the functionality of FBCS, will be sought utilizing full and open competition for FY 2010.  However, at this time it is essential to award a contract to allow continued utilization  of FBCS before the expiration of this software on December 31, 2008.  12.	Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify). I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.    _______________________________________________               __________________Signature of Technical/Requirements Representative                               Date ______________________________________________               ____________________Wayne B.
