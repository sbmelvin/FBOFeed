<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER:	Jordan-04-001
ISSUANCE DATE:		January 12, 2004 
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	February 17, 2004 at 12:00 Noon
POSITION TITLE:		USAID/Jordan Democracy Team Leader
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with an option for Year 3 and Year 4
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	Amman, Jordan
SECURITY ACCESS:	Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens

MARKET VALUE:

The USAID/Jordan Mission is issuing an Expression of Interest to qualified candidates for the position of Democracy Team Leader.  This position has been approved by the USAID/Jordan Mission, however, its GS 14 grade level is still being reviewed by USAID/Washington for approval. Candidates should be aware that this position could ultimately be classified at the GS 13 level. 

Interested parties should submit an application by following the instructions below.  If a suitable candidate is identified as a result of this Expression of Interest, no additional solicitation will be forthcoming from USAID/Jordan. 

The salary range for a GS l4 level is $72,381 – $94,098.  Nonetheless, the candidate’s past salary history and experience will determine the personal grade of the employee. 

INTRODUCTION:

The USAID Mission to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has been working to improve the quality of life for the Jordanian people for more than 50 years.  Since 1996, the U.S. Government has significantly increased the levels of Economic Support Funds that it provides to the Kingdom.  In December 2003, USAID/Jordan completed its five-year Country Strategy for the period of 2004 – 2009.  Under this new plan, assistance was deepened in three on-going objectives (water resource development, economic opportunities, and health) and expanded to address emerging opportunities in the areas of education reform and democratization/good governance.  With an operating year budget in fiscal year (FY) 2003 of $250 million, USAID/Jordan is one of the larger bilateral assistance programs in the region. 

USAID is already involved in democracy initiatives in Jordan.  Specifically, in March 2003, USAID/Jordan signed a $2.5 million Interagency Agreement with the Department of State to support civil society programming in Jordan.  In August 2003, USAID/Jordan completed a democracy sector assessment detailing key opportunities for assistance. Several democracy and governance programs are in the process of being developed and will focus on improving the capacity of the recently elected Parliament, enhancing the role of women, decreasing corruption, expanding the role of civil society in public discourse, improving the rule of law, and promoting a more open environment for the media.  Under the Mission’s new Democracy Strategy, it is estimated that USAID/Jordan will have between $35 million and $50 million over the next five-years to implement these and other governance-related programs.  Also, in conjunction with programming supported by the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), USAID/Jordan will work on both a bilateral and regional approach to democratization. 

The candidate selected under this Scope of Work will fill a new Democracy Team Leader position based in Amman, Jordan with occasional travel to regional population centers. She/he will be fully responsible for managing the vast majority of programs that will be implemented in the office.  It is expected that the Mission will also hire a Foreign Service National Project Management Specialist to assist in managing activities and providing local viewpoints on the DG Sector in Jordan.

Nonetheless, the successful candidate must be able to establish productive relationships with a wide range of senior counterparts, and be able to manage competing interests and demands.  Due to the multi-sector focus of the office in which this officer will be working, knowledge of the education sector is a plus.

JOB DESCRIPTION:

The Democracy Team Leader will be expected to work independently, with minimal oversight from the Office Director, based on a general assignment of responsibilities. The Democracy Officer will produce an annual work plan for accomplishing the stated duties and responsibilities, and will be responsible for daily management of his/her activities, informing and consulting with the Office Director as necessary. The Officer will have considerable latitude in the exercise of her/his duties for program design, management, and evaluation, and for the identification and resolution of issues affecting program performance both within and outside of the Mission.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

Depending on the timing of the arrival of the successful candidate in Jordan, she/he will assist in the selection of at least two large programs aimed at (1) improving the capacity of the recently elected Parliament and (2) decreasing corruption.  The Team Leader will be responsible for managing both these major programs. The Team Leader will also provide on-going support for refining USAID/Jordan’s strategy, contribute technical advice for the development and oversight of all activities in the Mission's democracy and governance portfolio, and manage the Mission’s senior contacts within the Jordanian civil and political spheres and within the USG Mission.  

SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENT:

1. Directly manage two major democracy and governance programs with the Parliament and civil society players to achieve the objective of improving democracy and governance in Jordan. This will involve the full range of contract and/or grant management functions including programmatic, administrative and financial oversight of activities to ensure that objectives are being met within USAID's guidelines and regulations, as well as overall strategic analysis and continual program evaluation. 

2. Participate actively in the Mission's democracy and governance strategic objective team through the provision of technical and managerial advice in defining strategic directions, analyzing program performance, establishing and monitoring performance indicators and evaluation systems, determining implementation methods and maintaining relationships with other donors and key Jordanian governmental contacts. Represent USAID at donor coordination meetings on issues related to democratization. 

3. Establish a wide range of high level contacts with Jordanian governmental and non governmental organizations and international donors, and through these and other contacts, analyze political and other trends affecting development of responsive and accountable Jordanian governance.

4. Interact with other USAID offices on all issues related to democracy, including reporting functions.

5. Manage a senior local hire Foreign Service national employee in the democracy area.

EVALUATION CRITERIA/SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS:

100 POINTS TOTAL:

1. (40 POINTS) The candidate should have at least five-years of experience in democracy and governance program development and management in such areas as parliamentary support, civil society strengthening, anti-corruption, and media support.  A significant amount of that experience should have been gained from working in developing countries. Prior experience in managing similar development programs is required. 

2. (20 POINTS) Previous experience in or knowledge of the Middle East and/or knowledge of Jordanian institutional structures required.  Arabic language skills highly desirable. 

3. (20 POINTS) A graduate or higher degree in regional area studies, political science, public administration or a related field is required.  Due to the multi-sector nature of the office in which this candidate will be working, experience or a degree in the education sector is desirable.
