<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source, contract with Government Scientific Source, Inc. of Reston VA for the purchase of a Harvard Physiocage Rodent Monitoring System.  This system is required for the Research Department at the Jesse Brown VAMC, Chicago IL and will be used by three separate laboratories to evaluate mouse and rat models to better understand and treat obesity, diabetes and hypertension.  It will also be used to evaluate the behavior of mouse models with Alzheimers, brain trauma and alcohol and drug addiction. The system must be able to monitor the metabolic rate (O2 consumption/CO2 production and calculations of respiratory quotient, energy exchange), food and water intake, as well as horizontal and vertical movement. In addition to the purchase of this equipment, it is anticipated that the resulting contract will include maintenance and repair of the system for an anticipated three Option Renewal Periods. NAICS 334516  500 Employees. To the best of our knowledge the Physiocage System is the only system that has the following unique characteristics which will meet the needs of the facility:  1) A food/drink intake design which enables the animals to have direct access to their food and drink without having to enter a separate chamber.  It shall allow for the accountability for the spillage with an accuracy of +/-50 mg.  2). System shall have sensors (laser diodes) for respiratory metabolic monitoring which cannot be affected by the relative humidity.  3). System required includes two unique parameters, one being through integrated weight cells in the animal cage to detect movement and monitor the animals weight.  The other parameter shall be infrared (IR) beams which when broken by the animal moving through the unit, also registers the animals vertical movement.  The size of the mouse cages (including the base and infrared frame) shall not exceed 18x38x34cm. VA requires that the analyzers, amplifiers, and flow switching units be stackable with the base dimensions for each unit of 23x15.5x31cm thus making the unit portable and easy to be moved. The sensor units must have the capability to be used interchangeably between the rat and mouse units. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes however; any contractor that can meet these requirements are requested to submit clear and convincing evidence of their ability to provide these products. Vendors are required to include but not be limited to manufacturers brochures, system properties and salient characteristics of product. Written notification must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on or before the response due date of this synopsis.  Information can be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer at diane.brazale@va.gov or via mail to the Contracting Officer, VAMC-GLAC, Building 5, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295.  No telephone requests will be accepted.     Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Government Scientific Source.
