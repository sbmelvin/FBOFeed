Many projects to be performed under these IDIQ contracts will require a Top Secret Clearance.  Some projects will require a Secret Clearance.  Location of performance is 20% (twenty percent) on-site at NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland and 80% (eighty percent) off-site at the contractor’s facility.  Contractor personnel shall travel when necessary to provide needed tasks through off-site meetings, training, conferences, design, installation, integration, maintenance, or system test.  As part of this travel, contractor personnel may be required to travel overseas and to serve as flight crew and onboard ships for extended (2-3 weeks) sea tests.  Offerors will need to respond to all elements of the RFP.  The anticipated contract type is a cost plus fixed fee with indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) delivery orders.  The period of performance will be from 13 April 2006 through 12 April 2009.  The scope of work to be performed will be divided into lots based on size standard under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code 541710, 1,000 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amdendment 1 to W56HZV-06-MS-RunFlatCompressor.  This amendment 1 is issued because the 1st notice contained unusual characters rendering illegible. This is a Sources Sought Market Survey seeking to identify potential suppliers, and it is for planning and informational purposes only.  This is not a request for proposal, nor is it an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation; therefore, a SOLICITATION DOCUMENT DOES NOT EXIST AND WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The following Request for Information (RFI) for this Sources Sought Market Survey is issued for purposes of conducting market research and encouraging companies to provide information concerning current indu stry practices.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey, or any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market  survey will not be returned.  The Program Managers Office, Light Armored Vehicles (PMO-LAV), located at the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), is formulating acquisition and life cycle support strategies for a Variable Function Insert (VFI) R un Flat Compressor Tool (RFCT).  The Run Flat Compressor Tool will be used to compress the Hutchinson VFI Run Flat Part # VF0025 for installation into the Michelin XML Tire Part # TR0015.  The RFCT must be able to withstand high volume usage (min 20 tires per day) under extreme adverse and field conditions.  The RFCT must have an expected life of no less than 7300 cycles.  It must be one-man portable and operated either by hand, or pneumatic operations.  If pneumatic operations are involved, the RFCT must b e capable of being integrated into the current pneumatics of the LAV (Recovery variant).  PMO-LAV is seeking candidate systems which do not require additional tools.  The RFCT should not adversely affect the safety of the operator or incur damage to the ti re assembly.  Operation of the compressor tool should be able to be accomplished by the operator or 2nd echelon maintenance facility.  The RFCT will be operational and maintainable in all types of climates and terrain where Marines deploy, specifically, in  arid, tropical, temperate, and artic climates, as well as amphibious operations.  The Marine Corps is looking for available Off-The-Shelf, or, Non-Developmental Item (NDI) systems to fulfill this potential requirement.  It is anticipated that PMO-LAV may purchase up to five units for test and evaluation, followed with a possible acquisition of 150-200 systems.   Industry Firms capable of meeting the potential requirement are invited to submit a response to this notice.   Electronic responses are preferred.  It is requested that the electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats:  Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Adobe Portable Document Format.  The maximum size of each e-mail message should be no more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 o f 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3, etc., as well as [Organization Name] response to MARKET SURVEY VFI Run Flat Compressor Tool.  Firms should include a point of contact, literature, brochures, price lists, state if the item is commercial or military,  previous history  for sale of this item or similar items (contract number, dollar amount, Government POCs, program description, etc), business size (i.e., large or small) and a summary of capabilities directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  In terested Firms are requested to respond NLT January 13, 2006.

<DESC>***  Modification to due date  --  Proposals will be due on or about February 28, 2006.  ***  Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID’s mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations. These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C viral pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for: 

Category A viral pathogens: Variola major and Viral hemorrhagic fevers;
Category B viral pathogens: Viral encephalitides; and 
Category C viral pathogens: Influenza.

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other IND-, NDA-, or BLA-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that have broad spectrum activity.  See the actual solicitation for research areas that are NOT supported. 

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about September 29, 2006.  Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NIH-NIAID-DMID-06-35 will be available electronically on or about December 15, 2005 and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/CMP Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID\Research Funding tab.  Once there, select “Funding Opportunities” then “RFPs Only” and then click on “BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-06-35, entitled, ‘Development of Therapeutic Agents for Selected Viral Diseases.”  

Proposals will be due on or about February 28, 2006.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide numbered note 26.

The intent of this project is to identify five (5) year parameters and requirements for communications and interoperability that will provide a roadmap for industry to develop products that reflects public safety’s long term needs as stated in the SoR.

Proposals do not need to address each of the six TAs in the SoR, but should instead focus on the TAs that the individual Contractor or Contractor team have expertise in.  The Firm Fixed Price contracts will have a six month period of performance.  This procurement will be a Best Value source selection using Full and Open Competitive Procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.  The Department of Homeland Security anticipates the award of these Firm Fixed Price contracts to be February 2006.  The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 and the applicable small business standard is $6.0 million.  This procurement is unrestricted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Orlando Training Systems Division (NAVAIR Orlando TSD) contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research and development (R&D) in the areas of training and simulation technology. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is intended to cover, in general, all R&D areas of interest to the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) and its customers in the areas of (1) Human Performance Representation, (2) Knowledge Integration, (3) Command, Control, Computer, Communication, Information (C4I) to Simulation, (4) Verification, Validation, & Accreditation (VV&A), (5) Natural Environment Representation, (6) Composable Mission Space Environments, and (7) Collaborative Environments for Engineering and Simulation Education.  Specific scientific points of contact for each research area are identified on Page 1 of the BAA, as well as a detailed process that allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to the DMSO Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Program, and projected funding.  This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported and consists of a technical dialog (telephone call to scientific point of contact and informal white paper submission), followed by formal proposal submission and contract award.  Those interested in performing research in the covered areas should download the BAA and initiate a technical dialog with the appropriate scientific point of contact.  Only questions regarding the BAA process itself should be addressed to the point of contact listed below.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for technical efforts in the area of modeling and simulation (M&S) pertinent to the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO).  DMSO's mission includes M&S coordination, M&S standards, and M&S services including: (1) Staffing and distributing DoD M&S plans, programs, policies, procedures, and DoD publications; (2) Promoting joint and cooperative research, development, acquisition, and operation of M&S systems, technologies, and capabilities among the DoD Components; (3) Managing and coordinating standardization efforts; (4) Establishing interoperability standards and protocols; (5) Performing studies and technical efforts to develop standards; (6) Acquiring, digesting, analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, storing, publishing and disseminating science and technology (S&T) information and engineering data; and (7) Providing advisory and other user services to their authorized user community.  During FY 2005, DMSO established an overarching program plan to address this mission.  This plan encompasses M&S coordination, joint and cooperative RDA and operation of M&S, standards, and common M&S services within DMSO's strategic context.  This strategic context includes an interoperability strategic objective focusing on interoperable environments for simulated operations, range operations and real operations based on the understanding that these environments are becoming so intertwined that interoperability among them is essential.  The enabling capabilities for the required interoperability are focused in the areas of interfaces and representations.  The strategic context also includes an M&S management strategic objective focusing on plans, policies, procedures, publications, and needs & requirements to fully implement DoD Directive 5000.59, DoD M&S Master Plan.  The standardization program of the DMSO supports all aspects of modeling and simulation (M&S) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Standards represent the output of M&S technical initiatives by providing the documentation by which they may be applied or implemented. Recognizing the importance of standards to the overall M&S program, DMSO was designated as the Lead Standardization Activity (LSA) for the Modeling and Simulation Methods and Standards (MSSM) Area of the Defense Standardization Program (DSP).  Focus areas under this BAA include Simulation Interoperability, Component Interoperability, Scenario Representations, Operations Management Representations, Entity Representations, M&S Capabilities Based Assessment, M&S Support of JCIDS, M&S Resource Registries, M&S VV&A, and M&S Education.

<CONTACT>Marjorie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. The purpose of this announcement is to identify those companies with appropriate expertise that might be interested in responding to a formal solicitation from NSWCPC for providing a mine identification and neutralization system capable of operating in the littoral environment.  The host platform for the system will be the MCM 1 Avenger class ship.  The system will replace the AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization System (MNS). Preferably the system would be non-developmental or commercial off the shelf.  The general background regarding usage and desired features of the system are as follows: ·	The system must provide the capability to positively identify, through visual means, both moored and bottom type mines. ·	The system must provide the capability to neutralize both moored and bottom type mines with the preferred method of neutralization being sympathetic detonation. ·	The system must be capable of being employed and operated safely from the host platform (MCM 1 Avenger class ship). ·	The system must be capable of integrating with current combat systems operating onboard MCM 1 Avenger class ships. ·	The system must be capable of accurately tracking the neutralizer during mission operations. ·	The system must be capable of reacquiring both moored and bottom type mines. ·	Physical dimensions of the system (size, weight, footprint) must not exceed the current physical dimensions of the AN/SLQ-48 MNS. Descriptive information is sought in the form of brochures, specification sheets and company points of contact. It is highly desirable that firms be ISO 9001 certified in the manufacture of equipments used in the types of applications of interest specified herein. Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time; this RFI may not directly lead to a request for proposals. Deadline for submission is 30 December 2005.

<DESC>1. This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation.  Please note that a solicitation for this effort does not exist and should not be requested. A Presolicitation Synopsis will not be issued.   2. NASA/MSFC intends to place “best value” Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for certain specialized engineering and project planning needs that may be necessary to support MSFC requiring organizations, including, but not limited to, the Exploration Launch Office, Science and Missions Systems Office, and the Office of Strategic Analysis and Communications.  The MSFC Specialized Engineering and Project Support (SEPS) BPAs will be awarded off the GSA Professional Engineering Services (PES) Schedule 871 contract.  Accordingly, only those companies presently having a GSA contract under Schedule 871 will be considered for award.  The specific Schedule 871 Special Item Numbers (SINs) applicable to the MSFC SEPS BPAs and any subsequent task orders issued under the BPAs, are provided in Paragraph 15 of this RFI.    3. NASA/MSFC anticipates awarding 3-5 SEPS BPAs in each of three (3) specialized engineering/project support categories for a target of 12-15 total awards.  The actual number of awards in any of the three BPA areas, and in total, may vary from these targets. 4. Contractors interested in being considered for an award of a MSFC SEPS BPA, and presently having a GSA Schedule 871 contract, are requested to submit technical capabilities, relevant past performance and GSA rate discount offer information in accordance with the instructions in this RFI.  Although companies are not precluded from submitting the requested information for more than one of the three MSFC SEPS BPAs, there is a very low probability that a company will receive a BPA in more than one of the three BPA categories.  Contractors must declare the BPA category(ies) for which they are submitting the requested information, and an order of preference for award consideration if they are submitting the information for more than one BPA category. 5. NASA/MSFC will review the technical capabilities, relevant past performance, and GSA rate discount offer information submitted by companies for potential award of 3-5 BPAs in each of the three (3) following BPA categories:  I.  Highly specialized, or niche, engineering skills for concept definition and analysis (special studies) for emerging exploration tasks.  This area will provide Program/Project Office (P/PO) with highly specialized engineering capabilities in system/subsystem areas over the next 5 years that are of interest to MSFC requiring organizations including, but not limited to, the Exploration Launch Office, Science and Mission Systems, and Shuttle Propulsion Office.  Efforts are expected to include end item deliverables and require little/no onsite presence.   Representative MSFC tasks include:   •	Propulsion and engine system design, development, and analysis including chemical, nuclear and hypergolic; and, addressing turbo-machinery, combustion devices, lines and valves •	Avionics and pyrotechnics system design, development, and analysis  •	Cryogenic system design, development, and analysis •	GN&C hardware, software, system design and analysis, sensors, (including sensors and instrumentation)  •	Spaceflight trajectory and dynamics analysis including earth-moon environment and lunar landing, utilizing analysis tools, such as: MALTO, Mystic, OTIS, Copernicus, and SNAP  •	Environmental control & life support systems design, development, and analysis •	Lunar lander & surface mobility systems design, development, and analysis •	Lunar infrastructure, design, development and analysis •	Computational fluid dynamics •	Advanced chemical propulsion for development of analysis tools for ultra-lightweight tanks, foam core systems, pressurization systems, mixture ratio control method, pump-fed and pressure-fed engines, cryogenics and gel propellants •	Solar sails & electro-dynamic tethers system design, development and analysis •	State of the art Hall thrusters, Next & NSTAR engines & BPT-4000 mission applicability •	Small satellite development and manufacturing •	Scientific instrument development such as high-energy astronomy and astrophysics, applied geology, remote sensing, and earth science research areas II.

Representative MSFC tasks include:   •    Models/prototypes, or demonstration/test/flight articles, for launch-landing-recovery systems,	          space transportation systems, environmental control & life support systems, lunar infrastructure systems, lunar lander & surface mobility systems, and associated technologies •    Test articles and models, and/or associated test fixtures, for turbo-machinery, combustion devices, rocket and propulsion systems/subsystems including: engines/lines/valves •	Components/elements/ systems/subsystems for: Avionics, Pyrotechnics, Cryogenics, GN&C, Power and Actuator and Structural/Mechanical/Thermal   •	Scientific instruments, including hardware for balloon flight and other non-space flight testing •	Environmental models for spacecraft and scientific instruments •	Testing of systems hardware breadboards and engineering models  •	Scale/subscale representations for engineering analysis or display of complex aerodynamic shapes, such as aeroshells for aerocapture •	Novel in-space/near-space systems such as MXER tether propulsion, tether enabled low-gravity facilities, tethered aerial platforms, and gossamer structures  •	Simulation and modeling of concepts or flight-like environments •	Specialized testing such as, but not limited to, aerospace materials, environmental effects, and in-situ resources   III.  Specialized Program/Project Planning, Analyses, and Support Representative MSFC tasks include:   •	Center-level performance management and capability development assessments •	Expert advice and recommendation development in support of the center governance system. •	Guidance and mentoring for program/project and institutional critical decisions and trades •	Program planning and control support, including cost, schedule and technical performance assessments for center assignments, and tool development. •	Program/project management integration, including program plan/documentation development, reporting, agenda management, acquisition planning and analysis of alternatives •	Center and organizational scorecard development and management 6. NASA/MSFC intends to only solicit and award BPAs to those companies that: 1) have technical capabilities that best address the statements of need and MSFC representative tasks described above, 2) provide past performance information that well supports or demonstrates the prime contractor’s technical skills and expertise as provided by the technical capabilities submission, and 3) are willing to provide discounts from the GSA contract rates.  Technical capability submissions should include information on contractor locations for the specialized support and the ability to provide near- or onsite support, particularly as it relates to the engineering test models/articles and specialized project support BPAs. 7. Although interested contractors are not precluded from submitting technical capability information as part of a team approach to the MSFC SEPS BPAs, that information must clearly distinguish the potential prime contractor’s technical capabilities from that of the teammates. Since the SEPS BPAs have no requirements presently identified, no evidence of formal commitments for contractor teammates is required or requested.  Accordingly, the review of technical capabilities will mostly consider the potential prime contractor’s capabilities.   8. NASA/MSFC intends to place the SEPS BPAs with a zero dollar ($0) Government-minimum order quantity.  NASA/MSFC is under no obligation to award any task orders against any of the SEPS BPAs.  9. Contractors must limit technical capability submissions to five (5) pages, front only, font size 12.  Attached is the Past Performance Questionnaire to be completed with relevant past performance for a maximum of three (3) contracts (past performance forms are not included in the five page limit on capability submissions).   10. NASA/MSFC intends, as a target, to award one-third of the total number of BPAs to small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable for the SEPS BPAs is 541330 and the size standard is $4.5M.  Contractors must provide their business classification information in their transmittal correspondence.  Contractors, as applicable, may be required to sign non-disclosure statements for certain requirements that may be authorized under the SEPS BPAs.  11. NASA/MSFC will manage the use of the SEPS BPAs in consideration of the potential overlap with the current Engineering, Science and Technical Services Contract (ESTS) and other existing Center-wide contracts.  The current ESTS prime contractor and its teammates will not be considered for an award of a SEPS BPA. 12. All information is due in this office by 3:30 P.M., Central Time, December 23, 2005. Please submit information to:   NASA/MSFC ATTN: PS/22M Rhoney Triplett Bldg 4666 MSFC, AL 35802			   Fax (256) 544-6560 13. Comments may be forwarded to Rhoney Triplett via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission. E-mail address is Rhoney.Triplett-1@nasa.gov and the fax number is (256) 544-6560. 14. This Request for Information is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. 15. The GSA Schedule 871 Special Item Numbers (SINs) applicable to the MSFC SEPS BPAs follows.

<DESC>Sources Sought for High-Throughput Screening (HTS) and Toxicogenomic Services The EPA?s National Center for Computational Toxicology is conducting research into the utility of high-throughput screening (HTS) and toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use.  The long-range goal is to establish methods capable of categorizing and predicting the toxicity of the large number of chemicals the Agency addresses. At this point we are seeking information about potential small business vendors/sources for the assays and analytical tools required for a chemical categorization and prioritization research project designed to have the ability to predict toxicity. Initially, this would entail a demonstration project based upon a set of 200-400 chemicals with a rich toxicological database representative of a number of structural classes and phenotypic outcomes. The project would evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic or metabonomic analysis of cells or organisms.  The goal of the project would be to mine the resulting data for associations between and among the various domains and the known toxicological properties of the base set of chemicals, in order to provide a structured strategy to categorize chemicals, identify potential toxicities and pathways, and to prioritize chemicals based on this predicted toxicity.   It is worth noting that many of the chemicals we would like to characterize have a wide variation in potency for a variety of endpoints, and are not just highly active (pharmacological) compounds. In addition, false negatives in predicting toxicity must be minimized. These are key issues distinguishing this Agency effort from prior pharmaceutical HTS efforts, and will impact how assays are actually carried out (e.g., concentrations of chemicals being tested, reagent concentrations, etc?) Another general point worth mentioning is that many of these chemicals must be metabolized to become biologically/toxicologically active. Thus many assays may have to be run both with and without exogenous metabolic activation systems.  Beyond the base set of several hundred chemicals or samples, we would like the option to process up to several thousand additional chemicals or samples, and have the flexibility to order over a multi-year period. We would prefer services to be broken down into rational sets of similar type, that could be selected from a pre-priced schedule of items as appropriate for Agency purposes.  Through this announcement, we are trying to identify possible small business commercial sources that can provide the chemicals, data and data analysis for this project. We would like to gather information on vendors/sources for 12 different types of services and assays.  Based on the information gathered, a subset of these services/assays would be pursued further and defined in one or more Statements of Work (within a single Request for Proposals).  We expect that various vendors will be able to provide each of these services.  In some cases, vendors may only offer a single type of service or assay, while in other cases a single vendor may offer multiple types of services/assays.

<DESC>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

This Source Sought Synopsis is to request responses from vendors who can provide the required services under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 541990 for All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. This synopsis is encouraging response from all businesses, but particularly, qualified small businesses, Service Disable-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Small Businesses, Small Business Joint Ventures, Consortiums and Teaming Partners. This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether or not there are qualified vendors to provide specialized technical support in the area of Strategic Communications.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) seeks technical support to the Director, DISA in his Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff-chartered role as the US Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (C3) System Engineer in performing long-range planning via architecture, threat, and programmatic analyses.  The GIG Enterprise Services Engineering Directorate, Nuclear C3 Engineering Section, Systems Analysis Team supports the Director in this role.  This technical support provides key acquisition strategies for evolving the Nuclear C3 System to meet national policy under the changing requirements of the post-Cold War and post 9-11 environments.  Evolution of the Nuclear C3 System includes insertion of new technologies such as net-centric capabilities where appropriate while maintaining the stringent technical performance required for nuclear C3.  System evolution will also include building upon the Nuclear C3 System to create a broader strategic command and control (C2) capability.

The contractor shall provide in-depth System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) performing system analysis, system engineering, vulnerability analysis, program and budget analysis, and ADP-based analysis regarding the Nuclear C3 System.  Analysis efforts shall focus on analyses of the Nuclear C3 System, for both current and future objective architectures as well as alternative architecture development for acquisition strategy decisions.  Analysis will include architectural, operational, requirements, functional, cost-benefit, modeling and computer analysis.  The contractor shall also provide engineering and analysis support in addressing issues that arise within the current architecture.  Subject matter of the analyses will generally include broad assessments of the Nuclear C3 System architectures, detailed trade-off studies of component systems in support of particular missions and system engineering analysis to improve the mission performance of component systems.  Recent studies include support to the Secretary of Defense-directed End-to-End Review of the Nuclear Command and Control System, the ASD (NII)- directed Strategic C2 Quick Look Study and a current study being conducted by the Joint C4ISR Decision Support Center to develop an integrated source of strategic C2 performance criteria, an objective architecture for a new Strategic C2 capability and a transition roadmap and investment strategy for the select portion of the strategic C2 architecture that requires to survive in the most stressed environment.  

The contractor shall perform quantitative assessments and analysis that may encompass a wide range of modeling and computer analysis as well as technical research and engineering judgement aimed at improving the performance and cost-benefit trade-offs within the nuclear C3 architecture.  A vital element of performing quality analysis relies on maintaining the current and objective architecture of the Nuclear C3 System, detailed descriptions of nuclear C3 nodes and systems, and tracking and analyzing the budget of component systems and programs supporting nuclear C3.  The contractor shall update on a recurring basis key documents such as the Nuclear C3 System Architecture Diagrams, the Nuclear C3 Thin-line Architecture, the 5-volume Nuclear C3 System Description, Nuclear C3 System Scenarios, and Nuclear C3 Program Tracking Report.  The contractor shall revise and produce certain recurring and regularly published documents as specified in the statement of work for a given year.  

Modeling and simulation of various component systems and the Nuclear C3 System as a whole are used in analysis efforts to assess performance and vulnerability to the Nuclear C3 System.  Existing modeling tools include, but are not limited to SCOPES [Space Warfare Analysis Center developed model for ballistic missile and warning system simulation], High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse Target Analysis and Planning System (HEMPTAPS), Advanced System Survivability Integrated Simulation Toolkit (ASSIST), Operability Assessment Tool for Systems (OATS), LFCOM [DTRA developed for Evaluation of Spread Debris effects on Longwave Propagation Links] and Weapon Effects on D-Region Communications (WEDCOM). These modeling tools are used in missile flight analysis, satellite coverage, predicting communication link performance in a nuclear disturbed environment, nuclear weapons effects such as effects from High-altitude Electromagnetic Pulses, as well as assessing end-to-end system performance of the Nuclear C3 System.  In addition to providing the ability to assess system performance, several of these modeling tools support assessing the Electronic Warfare Threat to the Nuclear C3 System and support Nuclear C3 Scenario Analysis.  

The contractor shall also provide support in recommending potential changes and updating Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Instructions (CJCSI) such as CJCSI 6811.01, which specifies Nuclear C3 Technical Performance Criteria and CJCSI 6810, which identifies critical nuclear C2 equipment and facilities.  Efforts are underway to expand these instructions to meet New Triad requirements to include nuclear, non-nuclear, active and passive defenses.  Other analytical support consists of providing quantitative support to division projects in other teams on an as needed basis such as those associated with nuclear C3 plans, procedures, senior leadership and Presidential communications.

It is anticipated that members of the contractor’s staff for this project shall work on-site at a DISA facility enabling the government and contractor staff to work in an integrated manner so as to achieve maximum efficiency.  The current facility for this work is located at 5275 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3801.  If sufficient space for all contractor personnel is unavailable at the government facility, the contractor shall, if necessary, provide support at their own site to include TOP SECRET/SCIF work areas in which to generate and store classified material.

This work will consist of both funded and unfunded tasks.  The overall level of work for each year is estimated at approximately 174 technical staff months (TSMs).  The funded tasks for each year will be 58 TSMs and will be funded from both RDT&E and O&M funds.  These tasks tend to be the same in each year of the contract, consisting of updates to government-specified recurring documents and analyses.  The remaining 116 TSM are available for unfunded tasks that have not been defined, and will be defined in task orders during each contract year. They may be funded by both RDT&E and O&M funds. These tend to be the special topic, quick reaction studies as required by ASD (NII) or the Joint Staff.  The contractor must be prepared to accept written task redirection on short notice in support of changing ASD (NII), Joint Staff, and other customer needs.  The redirection will be in accordance with appropriate contractual procedures.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether or not there are qualified candidates including capable Small Businesses that can provide the specialized system analysis and engineering technical assistance in performing system analysis, system engineering, vulnerability analysis, program and budget analysis, and ADP-based analysis regarding the Nuclear C3 System.  Responses must describe the company’s demonstrated ability to perform the work detailed in this description.  Responses should include recent (within the past five years) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contact with telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work.  Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered.  Responses should be no more than 25 pages.  Late responses will not be considered.   Responses should provide the business’s DUNS number and CAGE code and include a statement of self-certification under the NAICS code.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the Sources Sought Synopsis will not be returned.  If a RFP is issued, a SECRET clearance will be required for access to the reading room.

Responses may be submitted and are preferred via email, reference RFI PL64 0601 in the subject line of the email and send to: Sharlene.Capobianco@disa.mil. If you wish to submit your request via postal mail it should be addressed to: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Special Projects Branch (PL64), Attn: Ms. Sharlene Capobianco, 701 S. Courthouse Road, Arlington, VA 22204-2199. 


Security Clearances:

Performance of work under this contract requires regular access to information classified up to and including US TOP SECRET-Restricted Data.  Therefore, all management and key technical contractor personnel proposed for this effort must be United States citizens and must have been granted a final TOP SECRET security clearance at contract award.  The only permissible exception to this rule will be when it can be demonstrated that a specific individual is essential to a particular task and the task can be satisfactorily accomplished at a lower classification level.  In addition, the technical professionals must also have been determined eligible or indoctrinated for access to Special Compartmented Information (SCI) and Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) – Extremely Sensitive Information (ESI).

STAFF EXPERTISE: 

Because the division supports national policy makers at the highest levels, it is essential that the analyses performed and products produced be thorough, technically accurate, and timely.  Consequently, the contractor shall be required throughout the contract period to maintain the highest level of expertise in nuclear and related C3 systems and the most advanced and accurate analytical tools.  

The contractor personnel shall be a complimentary team with a detailed working knowledge of nuclear C2 and C3 systems and with operational and analytical experience in nuclear/strategic systems based upon experience within the nuclear community.  Team composition shall also include knowledge of the Planning Programming and Budget System (PPBS), requirements process, and acquisition process as well as National-level and DOD policy and guidance regarding nuclear C3.  National policy and DOD guidance regarding nuclear C3 is critical in ensuring that architecture recommendation and enhancements are consistent with established policy, guidance and performance criteria.

The contractor must have access to technical expertise in the areas of new or emerging communication and information technologies such as those being provided by net-centric capabilities. 

The effective use of analytical tools is essential to the mission of the US Nuclear C3 System Engineer.  Previous experience in using nuclear weapons effects models and simulations is required.  The contractor shall be required to provide knowledgeable personnel for operation of the government-furnished computer C3 analysis models/tools as described in the general description. 

Additionally, the work requires the exposition of exceptionally complex technical matter in reports that must be understandable to national policy decision makers who may not have detailed technical expertise in the area.  Hence, the contractor shall maintain on the project team a staff member with experience in technical editing who shall ensure high quality, easily understood documents of consistent style and appearance.  Excellent written and oral communication skills are required as contractor team members will be working directly with DISA personnel and may be required to interface with DISA customers. 

Because of the complexity of the subjects and the long period of time required to become proficient in them, the contractor shall make every effort to maintain stability in the core staff assigned to this contract.

<DESC>Request for Information for Biological Services to provide quality assistance and fish sampling functions in  support of the Northwest Division of the Corps of Engineers' Juvenile Fish  Transportation Program. 1.0 SUBJECT This Request for Information, (RFI) is seeking to identify Professional Services  Contractors capable of meeting specific criteria established for biological support to the  Fish Transportation Program for the Walla Walla District.  Responses are due to this RFI  by 4:00 PM on 15 December 2005.  See Section 6.0 for further information. 2.0  DESCRIPTION The Contractor shall provide biologists to participate directly in the juvenile fish bypass,  collection, and transportation programs at Lower Granite Dam (located near Pomeroy,  Washington), Little Goose Dam (located near Starbuck, Washington), Lower  Monumental Dam (located near Kahlotus, Washington), and McNary Dam (located near  Umatilla, Oregon) for specific time periods between March and October 2006.  The  Contractor shall provide one biologist at each project eight hours per day on a daily basis  (seven days per week) through the course of the contract work period.  The Contractor's  biologists will work closely with the Corps biologist responsible for the juvenile fish  collection and transportation facilities at each of the four dams. 3.0  REQUIREMENTS The contractor must have an Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 10 permit from  National Marine Fisheries Service which enables the Contractor to anesthetize and  sample juvenile fish of all ESA listed stocks that may be encountered at the projects.  The  permit must authorize the taking of the listed stocks at all four of the Corps' juvenile fish  transportation projects and must include a large enough take allowance to cover the  anticipated number of listed species handled in the daily samples at each project.  Work Items.  Specific tasks performed by the Contractor are as follows: 1) Sampling of Juvenile Fish.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all handling and  sampling of juvenile fish insofar as it affects the welfare of the fish.  The Contractor shall  participate in the daily project sampling activities along side personnel from various state  fishery agencies sampling fish under Bonneville Power Administration's Smolt  Monitoring Program.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that fish are  sampled according to criteria specified in the Corps' Fish Passage Plan (FPP).  The (FPP)  can be obtained at the following website: http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/tmt/documents/fpp/ The Contractor shall anesthetize and handle fish in the daily sample to determine the total  number of fish in the sample, species composition, average weight of the fish, and  descaling and injury rates.  These activities will usually occur simultaneously with other  facility activities including truck or barge loading.  The sample information will be used  by the Corps project biologist to determine adherence to the loading criteria contained in  the Corps' FPP. 2) Expanded Facility Collection Counts.  During the transportation season, a sample only  will be counted on a regular basis (under paragraph 3.a. above).  The Contractor shall  expand the total and species composition data from the daily sample to estimate total  facility collection.  At least once per day the Contractor shall also double check the Corps  biologist's separator collection sheet to determine if there are any errors in the project's  hourly collection estimate and raceway loading.  This is a critical part of the facility  operation upon which all loading and holding criteria are based.  Even slight  miscalculations may significantly bias the collection or loading estimate.  The Contractor  shall also record daily facility and sample mortality and shall calculate the number of  juvenile fish transported by either truck or barge by species on a daily basis. 3) Facility Inspections and Project Assistance.  The Contractor shall perform daily  inspections of the operation and maintenance of the juvenile fish collection and  transportation facilities at each project, for all activities directly affecting the welfare of  the juvenile fish, and for compliance with the criteria set forth in the Corps' FPP.   Activities to be inspected include, but are not limited to: trash accumulation and removal  from turbine unit trash racks; turbine unit gatewells; operation and condition of  submerged traveling screens and extended-length submerged bar screens; gatewell orifice  operation and condition; condition of the juvenile collection channels, dewatering  structures, and flumes; condition of counting, sorting, and holding facilities; sampling,  inspection, and marking operations; fish crowding and loading operations; and condition  of tractor-trailer and tug-barge units.  Any deviations from project operating criteria will  be reported to the Corps biologist for corrective action.  The Contractor shall also assist  the Corps biologist with orifice cycling and any fish handling required within the juvenile  fish collection system if it is required to be dewatered during the operating season.  The  Contractor shall also inspect adult fishways at Lower Granite, Little Goose, and Lower  Monumental dams, twice per week, for compliance with criteria set forth in the Corps'  FPP.  The inspection report shall be provided to the Corps biologist at each project after  completion of the inspection. 4) Gatewell Dipping.  Periodically during the transport season, changes in fish condition  may warrant a detailed inspection of fish in various parts of the collection and  transportation facilities.  A common inspection practice is to dip gatewells and examine  fish that have presumably just entered the bypass system.  The Contractor shall assist the  Corps biologists in dipping gatewells as necessary to evaluate condition of the fish.  A  complete record of gatewell dipnetting activity and fish condition data will be maintained  by the Contractor biologist. 5) Water Temperature Data Collection.  At McNary Dam, the Contractor shall be  responsible for collecting water temperature data in the juvenile fish collection channel,  turbine unit gatewells, forebay, tailrace, and fish holding facilities.  Water temperature  data will be collected hourly, and downloaded daily, using data logging probes from June  15, 2006 through August 30, 2006.  Temperature data will be collected from the B  bulkhead slot, at orifice depth, of all 14 turbine units.  The Contractor shall take forebay  water temperatures measurements at 7 locations across the face of the powerhouse,  approximately in front of every other turbine unit, at 3 locations along the spillway, and  in the project tailrace at the barge loading dock.  The Contractor will also record water  temperatures at 3 locations in the juvenile fish collection channel, in the juvenile fish  separator, and in a raceway.  The specific location for taking these water temperature  measurements will be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Corps biologist at  McNary Dam.  The Contractor shall maintain the data in a computer spreadsheet.  Water temperature data will be included in the weekly summary report prepared by the  Contractor (under 3.i.) and in a separate final report summarizing the monitoring effort  and data.  The summary report shall be provided on the same schedule as the annual  report in paragraph 3.i. 6) Activities of Outside Groups.  The Contractor shall monitor the activities of groups or  individuals engaged in fish research or other activities at the four projects to ensure that  the activities of others at the project are not having a deleterious effect on the welfare of  the juvenile fish.  The Contractor shall keep track of the number of fish handled, marked,  or sacrificed by each research group and shall include this information in the weekly  report under 3.i.  Any problems noticed will be reported to the Corps biologist. 7) Dissemination of Information and Coordination With Biologists at Other Projects.   The Contractor will summarize and record daily fish count information and the daily  activities of the collection and transportation program and be responsible for  dissemination of such information.  This does not include the gathering or use of fishery  information for management of fish stocks, hatchery or wild, within the waters of the  state or for the setting of management criteria therein.  Copies of all information collected  by the Contractor shall be provided to the Corps biologist at each project. 8) Ice Harbor Fish Condition Sampling.	 The Contractor shall provide two biologists  from either McNary or Lower Monumental dams to sample fish in the juvenile fish  sampling system at Ice Harbor Dam 4 hours per day, twice per week, from April 6, 2006  through July 15, 2006.  The Contractor shall be responsible for anesthetizing fish  collected by the Corps biologist at Ice Harbor project and evaluating the fish for fish  condition.  The Contractor shall provide the Corps project biologist, on each sampling  day, information on the number of fish sampled by species, descaling and injury rates by  species, and any information collected on gas bubble trauma symptoms or other fish  condition.  Fish sampled at Ice Harbor Dam are covered under a Corps ESA Section 10  permit from National Marine Fisheries Service. 9) Reporting.  The Contractor shall prepare weekly summary reports for each project on  juvenile fish collection and transportation program activities.  The weekly reports shall  cover the time period from Friday through Thursday and shall be provided to the Corps  biologist by the following Monday afternoon.  The report shall include numbers of fish  collected and transported for the week and season to date, daily and weekly fish descaling  rates, daily and weekly sample tank and facility mortality, daily barging and trucking  mortalities, general fish condition, daily and seasonal number and condition of ESA listed  adult fallbacks, unusual facility operations or deviations from facility operation and  maintenance criteria, any unusual or significant events anticipated during the following  week, and any other note worthy event concerning the collection and transportation  program.  Copies of the weekly report shall be distributed to interested parties in the  region via electronic mail under item 3.g.  An annual summary report shall also be  prepared jointly with the Corps biologist and submitted to the Corps in draft by 30 days  prior to the end of the work period at each project for a 10-day review and as a final  report on the last work day at each project.  Format will follow that of the Corps' Annual  Juvenile Fish Transportation Program Report and the Contractor's portion will be as  shown in Exhibit 1.  Both the weekly and summary reports shall be submitted to the  Walla Walla District through the Corps biologist at each project.  The weekly and annual  reports will be provided in electronic form in Microsoft Word format. 10) Safety.  All Contractor employees shall attend a project orientation meeting prior to  the collection and transportation season and weekly safety meetings while they are  working at the projects.  All project rules and regulations as well as all safety standards,  EM 385-1-1, will be adhered to. 4.0  RESPONSE GUIDELINES / EVALUATION Please do not Submit Budget Proposals.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
IN VIVO IMAGING OF TISSUE MICROSTRUCTURES AND CELLS
              
Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license a hyperspectral/multimodal microscope for in vivo imaging of living cells in a clinical setting.

Background: The gold standard in viewing the structure of living cells is light microscopy on a fixed tissue section.  However, this requires removal of tissue from the patient (ex vivo), and the time required for tissue processing results in significant delays.   

Description:  Using various excitation wavelengths, a hyperspectral microscope takes advantage of autofluorescence and polarized light scattering from cellular components to obtain composite images that highlight their presence.  The light collection efficiency is maximized to achieve image acquisition times and rates suitable for in vivo applications.  

Advantages:  This technology employs the benefits of multi-dimensional spectroscopic imaging at the micro-scale but without the complexity of nonlinear microscopy or the costs, complexity, and signal loss of confocal microscopy.
•	Apply in vivo in clinical settings
•	Non-invasive to cells
•	Provide fast, real-time imaging and monitoring of living cells  
•	Incorporate a large variety of optical imaging approaches 
•	Minimal operational complexity
•	Can be made portable  

Potential Applications:   
•	Microscopic imaging tool to assist during surgery  
•	Monitoring tissues or organs during testing of specific drugs or after exposure to adverse conditions, e.g., radiation

Development Status:  A prototype of the hyperspectral microscope is located at the University of California Davis Medical Center.  The U.S. patent application has been filed for this invention.


LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has delegated authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as conducting periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations and these regulations are applied during administration of the personnel security program.  Background investigations are also conducted in accordance with other relevant regulations and Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures that will be made known to the Contractor.  

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors’ duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $53.00 per hour.   The hourly rate will be reviewed on an annual basis and may be adjusted as determined by the increase of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Internal reviews of Contractor performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

In compliance with ATF’s specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor’s invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.   


Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATF’s computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must be a certified contractor in the Central Contractor Register (CCR), for payment via electronic funds transfer.  

ATF intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  There is an initial solicitation with a closing date of December 12th, 2005.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) companies.     ATF’s objective is to provide a sufficient number of sources, geographically distributed, to ensure prompt and efficient performance of background investigations.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically add new contractors to the pool.  Therefore, ATF will retain offers received after the initial closing date and continually accept new responses for future consideration.  ATF will acknowledge receipt of offers and evaluate them for award when the need arises.

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror – Commercial Items (Oct. 00) is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition.  Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 99) Evaluation.  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; and proof that FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial has been read and fully understood.   A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 can be found on the web at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/oa/oa52-212-3.doc or you may submit a request to siadministration@atf.gov.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor’s acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as “passed” will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 54 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 30 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 24 must come Vendor Qualifications.

a.  Experience/Capabilities (45 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor’s experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor’s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (30 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (24 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a “pass” or “fail” basis.  A vendor’s offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor’s assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

If a copy of the Statement of Work is required in order to respond to this solicitation, please submit a written request via email to siadministration@atf.gov.  Anyone wishing to respond to this solicitation should submit a current resume with his/her social security number, as well as all the requested information within the content of this solicitation.  This solicitation will be open throughout the period of this BPA.  All proposals received after August 26th, 2005, will be evaluated on a continual basis as needs dictate.  All responsible sources may submit an offer of interest throughout this time period.  Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  (No phone calls will be accepted).  

Proposals are to be submitted via mail at 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Room 2474, Washington, DC 20226, or via email to siadministration@atf.gov and must contain all of the required information.  Point of Contact:  Chief, Personnel Security Branch.

STATEMENT OF WORK: 

This is a request for quote to provide on call remedial maintenance and preventive maintenance for four IRS owned White power files, two model number 72141E, one model number 72141W and one Model Number 72200K.  The IRS wants to enter into an agreement with a company that will provide unscheduled repairs, including repair parts, to the equipment when needed in addition to providing preventive maintenance in accordance with Manufacturer specifications at least twice per year.


Preventive maintenance shall be performed in accordance with manufacturer specification and include, as a minimum, cleaning, oiling and necessary adjustments.  It will be scheduled via mutual agreement between the IRS and Contractor.  


On-call service includes parts and repair of failed equipment.  Historically, on-call service has been minimal, with no calls made in the last two years.  Vendor is expected to respond to calls the same day if notified prior to 12 Noon or no later than the following morning for calls made after 12 Noon.  Service hours are Monday - Friday 8:00am through 4:00 PM.  


The vendor will coordinate with a designated IRS Point of contact to schedule preventive maintenance.   A designated IRS Point of Contact will notify Vendor if remedial maintenance is required.  IRS points of contact will be designated at time of award.


Contractor Performance:  Contractor’s performance under this contract will be evaluated by the IRS end users.  The evaluation will be based on IRS  monitoring of Vendor’s performance to ensure that required PM’s and repairs are performed.  Failure to perform required tasks may result in payment reduction.


Required tasks and standards are:
(1)  Contractor coordinates with the end user to establish a mutually agreeable schedule for performance of preventive maintenance and performs maintenance in accordance with the schedule.

(2)  Contractor responds to request for repairs the same day or the next day and that repairs made are adequate to return equipment to proper working condition.


Contractor’s failure to comply with the above may result in reduction in payment.  If reductions in payment are applied they will be calculated as described below.   


If contractor performs PM one or more days after the agreed on date, or reports the next day, or later, after being notified in the morning of a repair, a reduction equal to one day of service for each day that contractor is late may be imposed.  Any reductions will be based on the agreed on price for service. The payment will be reduced by a prorated amount for each day that the service is not performed plus 10% administrative fee. The daily rate will be computed by dividing the periodic rate by the number of work days in the period, i.e., the quarterly rate will be divided by 65 (13 weeks X 5 workdays per week).  


The contract is for 5 years, consisting of a base period that begins January 1, 2006 and four one year options beginning January 1, 2007.


Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL 

1.  Offeror will submit a quarterly price for the base period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and each option period as identified in the price schedule.

The quarterly price will be Contractor’s annual price divided by four.  In arriving at the price Offeror should consider the cost of preventative maintenance and estimated/possible cost for remedial repairs.  Include in your proposal an explanation of any limitations or what is included in your estimated cost for remedial repairs.  

2.  Offeror will provide a brief statement (one to two paragraphs) addressing his ability to provide the maintenance and include the names and contact information of one to three references who will attest to offeror’s ability to perform maintenance on this type equipment and Offeror’s reliability.  


Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  

Two factors will be considered in evaluating quotes. The first factor, demonstrated ability to perform required work and reliability, is more important than the second factor, price.  The IRS will use the information provided in Vendor’ statement addressing his ability to provide the maintenance (see item 2 above) to evaluate offeror’s ability to perform work and reliability.      


Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-5 - Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items (Sept 2005).  Copies of Items 1 and 2 may be obtained from the CO, item 3 is included in its entirety)

The contract is tentatively scheduled for award on or before December 30, 2005, with five events planned between January 9, 2006 through March 8, 2006. The contractor would have approximately two weeks to plan and market each event.

13.  Question:	 Please explain what exactly is expected for task “(d) Collaborate with U.S. Department of State marketing staff and external public relations and advertising vendors to market and promote events.”  Will there be funds for media advertising of the events?  Specifically, what mode of advertising is expected and will be funded?

Answer:	The mode of advertising includes media (print and online) advertising, email marketing, partnership/alliance marketing, networking/word of mouth, and electronic communications, in addition to public relations/media outreach that must be included in the $11,000 budget. The contractor must work and collaborate directly with the Department’s marketing consultant. 

14.

19.  Question:  What is the total maximum combined budget for these 9 events?

Answer:  $99,000
 
20.  Question:	It is my understanding that the nine (9) diversity-focused events to be planned are to target mid-career professionals who may have an interest in working for the U.S. Department of State as a Civil Service or Foreign Service employee. So is it safe to assume that the U.S. Department of State will be responsible for securing the workshop presenters (or discussion panelist)?

27.  Question:	Requirement section (e) ~ Will the on-line and off-line metrics report be the only report to be submitted or should there be a submittal of an overall status report as well? 

Answer:	Overall status report must be included.

<DESC>Synopsis This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial hardware  prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as  supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This  announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being  requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The  solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those  in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05. The number  assigned to it this solicitation W15P7T-06-Q-B403. The proposed action  is for a firm fixed price type contract for 1000 Isuzu diesel engines,  Model No. C-240PW-28, CAGE 4N530, 4 cycle, liquid cooled, 4 cylinder,  naturally aspired, 145 Cubic Inch, 4.02 inch stroke, 3.39 inch bore,  CCW rotating, SAE #4 Flywheel Housing, 32 BHP at 1800 RPM, 491 pound  engine.  This action is for limited competition between any vendor with  a business relationship with Isuzu.  Isuzu is the only manufacturing  source listed on the Source Control Drawing (SCD) for this diesel  engine.  Isuzu is the only source that possesses technical data  (drawings or specifications) that completely defines the form, fit, and  function (F3) of this item. The SCD contains Isuzus commercial part  number (C240PW-28), and specific engine calibration and painting  requirements. The SCD provides top-level information on the required  item, but does not provide detailed manufacturing, testing or  acceptance data that would be needed by any other source to manufacture  this item. Only Isuzus diesel engine meets all of the Governments  performance requirements.  Isuzu manufactures this diesel engine from a  standard product line, customizing the engine for the Governments  applications using parts from a standard set of accessories and  alternative parts.  There are no nationally recognized industry  standards or specifications that define the F3 of this diesel engine.  Failure to acquire these diesel engines will result in a lack of  equipment needed to provide power to the 15kW Tactical Quiet Generators  (TQG).  Note, the Isuzu supplied mechanical governor components that  are not used in the 15 kW TQG configurations shall be removed from the  engine prior to preservation and packaging.  A plate or other sealing  stiff protective material shall be installed in place of the governor  components to protect internal components of the engine.  The standard  commercial warranty applies to this procurement, and the warranty  period shall be a minimum of one year.  Any changes or modifications  from the C-240PW-28 shall be submitted in writing to the Government IAW  52.212-4(c) Changes.

Note , the Isuzu supplied mechanical governor components that are not used in the 15 kW TQG configurations shall be removed from the engine prior to preservation and packaging.  A plate or other sealing stiff protective material shall be installed in place of t he governor components to protect internal components of the engine.  The standard commercial warranty applies to this procurement, and the warranty period shall be a minimum of one year.
