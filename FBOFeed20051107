The RFP will be issued on or about 11/22/05.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 12/23/05.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of Electronic Protective Measures Modem System (EMS). The competitive bidding is limited to companies engaged in delivering similar capabilities to their National authorities. NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee. The total value is estimated at 10 million Euros ($12 million USD).

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-CO-11789-EMS. The NATO project number is 2001/5CM03013-0. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

1. NATO has identified the need for a Super High Frequency (SHF) Anti-Jam (AJ) Satellite Communications Network Modem capability within NATO IV and NATO V Satellite Communications System. That capability is to be provided by the Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) Modems System (EMS).   

2. EMS shall support at SHF the communication and associated control capabilities under jamming conditions for deployed CJTF operations at Medium Data Rates (MDR) [64 kbps, 2Mbps]. 

3. EMS shall comply with Ratification draft of STANAG 4606 edition 1, dated 25 August 2004.  

4. EMS equipment shall meet the environmental conditions that apply for operations involving land or maritime deployments. The TRANSEC function and the control messages exchanged between control entities over the air (i.e. between the Network controller and controlled terminals) shall be secured in accordance with NATO security policy.

5. EMS shall operate within the coverage area involving a group of land and/or maritime users deployed under one or more beams supporting three concurrent Major Joint Operations (MJO) or more than three concurrent Operations smaller than an MJO.

6. EMS shall support operations where users are all in the same coverage; such as Land, Maritime, NATO.

7. EMS shall support operations where users are spread under coverages which do not overlap and are cross strapped on board of the satellite, i.e. between:

(a) Land coverage and NATO coverage (including when Land coverage and NATO coverage do not overlap);

(b) Maritime coverage and NATO coverage (including when Maritime coverage and NATO coverage do not overlap).

8. EMS shall support point to point and network mode of operations as defined in STANAG 4606, Edition 1. Specific maritime mode of operations such as:  

(a) Listen only; 

(b) Electronic Supportive Measures as per STANAG 4606, Edition 1; and 

(c) Operation in presence of worst-case maritime platform dynamic with a minimal degradation in performance.

EMS Main Components:

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available with T-VEC Technologies Inc, Herndon VA for the enhancement and modification of the FIPS 201 Conformance Testing Toolkit.  

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541519.  The size standard is $21M.

Following the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) issued on Aug 26, 2004, NIST developed the draft standard FIPS 201 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/draft-FIPS_201-110804-public1.pdf), a family of specifications pertaining to smart card personal identity credentials that must be interoperable across all federal agencies. NIST is mandated to establish a conformance testing program to validate products for conformance to SP 800-73. This includes accrediting laboratories, providing them with tools and guidelines to perform conformance testing and validating the evaluations performed by these laboratories.  
As the developer of the FIPS 201 Conformance Testing Toolkit, T-VEC Technologies, Inc. is singularly qualified to implement the required enhancements and modifications.  The Toolkit is NIST owned, not available in the public domain, and distribution is limited only to laboratories accredited under the NIST Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP).   

Under this NPIVP program, NIST is committed to OMB to provide the necessary tools and guidelines to laboratories to enable them to complete the certification process and thereby make available FIPS 201 compliant products in the market by January 2006 to facilitate procurement by all federal agencies. This requirement is for the enhancement and modification of the FIPS 201 Conformance Testing Toolkit as delineated below:

(1)	(CR1) Change Request 1 (Enhancement):  Following the re-definition of Card Application Administration Key, enhance the toolkit with new tests that will test all the different types of authentication modes using this key. 
(2)	(CR2) Change Request 2 (Modification): Following the change in security conditions for two APDU functions (RESET RETRY COUNTER and PUT DATA), modify the tests for testing these functions to incorporate the new security conditions as part of the execution scenarios.
(3)	(CR3) Change Request 3 (Enhancement):  Develop additional tests for verifying execution of chained APDU commands.
(4)	(CR4) Change Request 4 (Enhancement) :  Develop tests for verifying correct implementation of multi-byte length fields as part of BER-TLV data object representation.
(5)	(CR5) Change Request 5 (Modification/Enhancement):  (a) Provide configuration option to re-direct PIV Middleware calls to a PIV card on a smart card reader. (b) Provide tests for additional execution scenarios for the three middleware functions – pivCrypt, pivPutData and pivGenerateKeyPair.
(6)	(CR6) Change Request 6 (Enhancement):  Provide Configuration Options to input the subset of optional PIV data objects implemented in the particular vendor product under test and modify the toolkit to display and run only those applicable tests.
(7)	(CR7) Change Request 7 (Enhancement):  Develop a Reporting Tool for use by test laboratories that will take the outputs of the test runs and produce test results summary, test verdict as well as provide a means to enter product/vendor information as well as observations on vendor documentation.
(8)	Other Enhancements and Modifications:   Other unforeseen required enhancements and modifications that may be identified in the during the performance of the work.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIST to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:30 PM EST on November 11, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>GSA ANNOUNCES HISTORIC PROPERTY PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY 

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is looking for imaginative proposals for the preservation and development of the historic Federal Building, 50 United Nations Plaza, San Francisco, CA. This Federal Office Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is an integral part of the Civic Center landmark district. The property was completed in 1936, in a Beaux Arts style, by renowned San Francisco architect, Arthur Brown, Jr., who also designed four other major structures in Civic Center including City Hall. The property, comprises 6 stories of approximately 350,000 gross square feet, is located on southeast corner of Hyde and McAllister Streets with a main entrance fronting onto United Nations Plaza, a pedestrian mall and open market area.

GSA is seeking private investment to restore and reuse an important historic property that no longer has a viable Federal use. The building will be retained in GSA’s inventory, but be made available on a long-term outlease under Section 111 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1976. Adaptive use concepts must be financially feasible. The Request for Qualifications and Adaptive Use (RFQ&U) is now available to the public. If you are interested in obtaining a copy of the RFQ&U please contact Zhanna Odesskiy via phone at (415) 522-4092, fax (415) 522-3116, or email at zhanna.odesskiy@gsa.gov

<DESC>Solicitation SP4410-05-R-8001 will be issued for the recovery of precious metals from GFP/GFM.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be a five year contract with an eighteen month base period, three twelve month option periods and a six month option period.  The contractor will be required to recover precious metals (gold, silver, platinum family metals) from government furnished property/government furnished material (GFP/GFM).  The contractor will be required to either pickup the GFP/GFM from Government sites throughout the United States or GFP/GFM will be shipped to the contractor’s facility for the contractor to then process into a homogeneous state.  Assays of samples by contractor will be used to determine the amount and type of precious metals contained in the lots.  Settlement will then be for an equivalent amount of refined precious metals due the government.  The processing of only part of the material for the purpose of representing the whole is not allowed.  The Government will specify in the contract the methods to be used by the contractor to process the material.  Any alternative methods must be approved by the Government.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released in early to mid June 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Radio Frequency Analog Spectral Processors.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice 

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  Tunable RF filters and filter banks, RF switches, and high-speed high-performance component integration strategies. Advances in these areas will be applied towards the realization of a compact low-power RF front-end for handheld communications applications. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the BAA 06-08 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2006.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site — http://www. http://teaming.sysplan.com/asp – has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. John D. Evans, fax:  (703) 248-1808, electronic mail: John.Evans@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-08, Analog Spectral Processors, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, FedGrants website: http://www.fedgrants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers should submit an original and five (5) copies of the full proposal and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two (2) separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-08, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-08) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, December 20, 2005, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-08 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make awards without discussion.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants / experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Analog Spectral Processors). 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-08.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<DESC>The Federal Correctional Institution, Jesup, Georgia, is soliciting quotations for a service contract for the provision of 23 digital copy machines along with a maintenance agreement for these copiers.  The contract time period will include a base year not to exceed (12) months with the possibility of two (2) one-year option periods.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract with an estimated award date of December 4, 2005.  We are soliciting for 23 copy machines on a leasing agreement.  Please provide us with the flat rate of a cost per copy for the maintenance agreement for each machine.  This cost should include any leasing costs we will be required to pay.  Also, the agreement will include all repairs, supplies, such as toner, etc. and what other items are included.  The standard contract is inclusive of everything with the exception of staples and paper.  Please confirm this in your quote.

If there is an allowance of copies per month, please provide us with this figure.  If this figure is reached, please provide the overage cost per copy, even if it is the same amount of the original cost per copy.

If your company does receive the award of the contract, you will receive a listing of each location with a contact name and extention number in order for meter readings to be obtained.

Along with a bid on the actual copier maintenance and cost per copy, we are requesting the copy machines that you provide be a digital type machine with some of the following features included:  stapling, sorting, duplexing, automatic feed on top, reduction/enlarging, auto tray switching, book copy, photo mode, etc.  

As for repair calls, there will be a requirement of a 24 hour turnaround after the repair call has been made.  There is also a requirement of two technicians, at a minimum, to be available to repair the machines; therefore, no down time should be experienced when placing repair calls.  The names of the technicians must be provided at the time of submission of your quote.

We will not be taking advantage of the networking system that so many companies offer.  There are too many hindrances with our agency that restrict us from taking advantage of this feature.  This should not be included in your price.

An invoice must be received from the company who receives the award each month identifying costs for the prior month's services.

Please be advised, on a security note, if your company receives the award of this copier maintenance contract, the technicians you provide to perform the maintenance, or any other representative from your company, will not have any communications or any contact with our inmate population at the Federal Correctional Institution, Federal Satellite Low or the Federal Prison Camp.  If it is reported that communications have been taking place with the inmate population, based on the circumstances and the severity of the breach of security, dismissal will be warranted and the contract will be immediately terminated.  Please be aware of this!

NAICS CODE:  541710

FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514

TITLE:  Rapid Processing of Intelligence Data

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 04-09-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Oct 05; FY 07 by 1 Oct 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07; and, FY 09 by 1 Oct 08.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sept 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas:  1) High Speed Text Survey and Selection Capabilities; and 2) Revolutionary Techniques for Large-scale Database Processing

1)  High Speed Text Survey and Selection Capabilities.

The focus will be on processing textual information over multiple channels at high speeds (10 Gbit/s and up). There would be roughly four modes of operation: survey, selection, temporal, correlation.

a. The Survey mode should be able to:

- Identify prevalent languages on each tributary (STM-4 to E1); 
- Identify prevalent domains (STM-4 to E1); 
- Identify significant changes to tributaries such as loading, times of peak traffic, language distribution, etc.

b. The Selection mode should be able to:

-  Select messages (or random samples) in specified languages; 
-  Select messages (or random samples) containing specified character strings; 
-  Select messages on specified topics; 
-  Cluster messages by similarity (without training) and select messages belonging to user selected clusters; 
-  Cluster messages according to geographic information (either according to content within the message, or to sending or receiving metadata); 
-  Identify messages on previously unseen topics (birth of new topics) (novel and new); 
-  Identify messages on vanished topics (death of old topics) (how do you know when the old topic is dead, by time decay, etc); 

c. The Temporal mode should be able to:  

-  Select messages on specified topics with automatic adaptation to changes within the topic; 
-  Given automatic adaptation to changes in topics, identify prior messages (from stored metadata such as scores) that were previously unselected due to insufficiently rapid adaptation; 
-  Given a set of messages on a given topic, identify previous messages on the same topic (from stored metadata such as scores); 

d.  The Correlation mode should be able to:

-  Compare a high-speed link with a news feed (e.g. Reuters) and identify / correlate topics of interest; 
-  Compare the text on one high-speed link with another and identify correlations where the two links are co-located and connected by a high-speed network and where they are connected by a low speed dial-up network.

2)  Revolutionary Techniques for Large-scale Database Processing.

In the context of this BAA, the term "database" is intended to convey a new kind of extremely large, omni-media, virtually-centralized, and semantically-rich information repository that is not constrained by today's limited commercial database. This BAA seeks innovative technologies needed to architect, populate, and exploit such a data environment. Key metrics include the amount of total information that is potentially covered, the utility of its data structures for data entry and use by humans and machines in searching and browsing, data integration, and capability to automatically populate, and the completeness, correctness, and timeliness of the information when used for predictive analysis and modeling in exploiting the information in these repositories.  It is anticipated this will require revolutionary new technology.

The data environment envisioned is of an unprecedented scale, will most likely be heterogeneous and distributed, must be capable of being continuously updated, and must support both autonomous and semi-automated analysis. The latter requirement implies that the representation used must, to the greatest extent possible, be interpretable by both algorithms and human analysts. The data environment must support change detection and be able to execute automated procedures implied by new information. Because of expected growth and adaptation needs, the effective schema must be adaptable by the user so that as new sources of information, analytical methods, or representations arise, the representation of data may be re-structured without great cost. If distributed, the database may require new search methods to answer complex, less than specific queries across physical implementations and new automated methods for maintaining consistency. 

The potential sources of information will include extensive existing databases.  Innovative technologies are sought for treating these databases as a virtual, centralized, grand database.  This will require technologies for automatically determining schemas, access methods and controls, and translation of complex English language queries into the appropriate language for the relevant databases.

A successful effort would require the offeror to:  

a. Develop the capability to rapidly populate databases with information from incompatible databases, semi-structured and structured data formats, geospatial databases, and natural language text.

b. Develop domain ontologies, web-wrappers/scrappers, and data extractors, to facilitate automatic interpretation of data without a priori knowledge of database schemas.


II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $36M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $9M; FY 06 - $9M; FY 07 - $9M; and FY 08 - $9M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $150K to $2M per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. The Government anticipates multiple awards in each of technical areas. A multi-phase approach will be needed to achieve program goals. Proposers should note that approaches with eclectic ideas from multiple technical specialties or communities are actively sought. The degree of advances will vary among the technical areas of interest, but the goal is to create a series of prototype systems that add value quickly and improves rapidly over the program schedule -- the primary goal is a series of leave-behind prototypes with limited set of proof-of-concept demonstrations in very high risk areas.

The anticipated start date for the FY 05 efforts under the solicitation is February 2005.

III.  EXPECTED TECHNICAL DELIVERABLES.

1) Regular Software Releases.  Software releases will be packaged with detailed technical documentation; user documentation, libraries, sources and executable code, and delivered as self-extracting installation executables for the expected computing environment of our customers.

2) Technical Briefings and Reports.  Briefings and reports will be developed as a product of individual effort, a tiger team, or as part of a larger working group.  Quarterly Status Reports and Annual Project Summary Reports must be submitted as a minimum.

3) Internet Products.  Software products that integrate (1) and (2), will be directly uploaded/posted to Web pages specified by AFRL Program Managers.  Proposers are encouraged to identify data and software components (including source code) they would be willing to make available to others to help achieve the overall objectives of this BAA.

IV. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  

2.  COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.

V. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

1.  APPLICATION PACKAGE:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  WE ARE SOLICITATING WHITE PAPERS ONLY.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.

Electronic submission to BAA0409@rl.af.mil will also be accepted. 

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation. 

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. 

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.   Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.   Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.    Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.    A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know. 

3.  REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.  Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VIII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Roger J. Dziegiel, Jr., telephone: (315) 330-2185 or email BAA0409@rl.af.mil.  Email submissions preferred.

The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a wholly-owned Federal Government Corporation, intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor who can provide physical examinations for AmeriCorps*NCCC, a residential national service program operated by the CNCS.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Central Region Campus is located at 3001 South Federal Blvd., Denver, Colorado and serves local community projects, as well as projects in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.  In case of disaster relief (i.e. Gulf Region hurricanes, forest fires), members may be sent to other state locations. 

During January 3, 2006 approximately 33 Team Leaders and on January 23, 2006, 260 Corps Members will arrive on the Central Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test, “PPD testing” for tuberculosis and tetanus shots. 
 
Phase I - On January 3, 2006, 33 Team Leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination at the provider’s facility on Wednesday, January 4, 2006, 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm.

Phase II - On January 23, 2006 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to have the physical and drug testing to be done at the medical provider’s facility (one location).  Would like to schedule 65 members each day for 4 days, January 25, January 26 January 27 and January 28, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 65 members within a 8 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows: 
All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to perform medical and other related services.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS:

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes.  It is not an indication the Government will contract for the services contained in the RFI.  The Government shall not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) this notice serves as a request for information for Verification and Validation (V&V) of certain modeling and simulation models, as described below, in support of the Air Force Studies and Analyses Agency (AFSAA).  The mission of the AFSAA is to conduct analyses in support of decisions by the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF) and the Air Force Director of Operations (AF/XO).  To carry out its mission, AFSAA uses modeling and simulation to support force structure decisions, analyze potential force employment options and evaluate the contribution of various weapon systems to the outcome of key objectives in theater-level conflicts.  To examine the military potential of proposed doctrinal changes or evolving weapon systems, AFSAA uses flexible, state-of-the-art theater-level models. These models need to be verified and validated as reasonably representing real world operations and effects before the results are utilized.  Prior to release to analysts, AFSAA requires V&V of Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) by a party independent of its’ developers, to ensure it is a reasonable replacement for THUNDER.  This effort will take place in parallel with STORM development, with the intent of allowing rapid transition from THUNDER to STORM upon successful completion of V&V.  
Respondents to this RFI should provide a brief qualifications and capability package to include a description of your organization's location and ability to operate at Government owned facilities in the National Capitol Region by providing the necessary personnel, with similar competed past performance on projects with current and in place TS/SCI Security clearances to perform the above potential requirements.

(2) If small, provide classification status (small, emergent business, small disadvantaged business (which disadvantaged group under Section 8(a)), hub zone, woman-owned, service-disable-veteran-owned), does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.  
Interested respondents submitting a response, comments and/or questions with respect to the information requested in the RFI and/or PWS shall direct them, in writing via email, to Ms. Deborah Doyle, Contracting Officer Deborah.Doyle@bolling.af.mil  and Ms. Junitea Cooper (Ctr), AFDW/A7KS, Junitea.Cooper@bolling.af.mil .

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is expanding its research and development capability to research the phenomenology of all spectral imagery data in support of geospatial intelligence analytic issues. NGA must improve its ability to support a robust processing and analysis of a variety of spectral data, including data from civil, commercial and foreign sources operating on various platforms.  Within this overarching objective, NGA, InnoVision, is establishing a capability to integrate scientists and geospatial intelligence analysts into teams, which will develop processes that could be the basis for methodologies and analytic procedures to address hard intelligence issues using spectral and other source data. 

NGA, Acquisition Contracts Office wishes to conduct a market survey and is therefore issuing a Request for Information (RFI) concerning the technology level of airborne research and development Laser Imagery and Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor technologies.  The Government intends to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) if the information from this market survey indicates that vendors either can meet the Government specifications described in this document or is on a research and development path, which indicates that they will meet or come near meeting the described specifications in the near future and if funding is available for this effort.  In summary, NGA wants to know if vendors can provide High Resolution Terrain elevation:-5 at 10,000 feet AGI, NGA’s threshold.  NGA wants to know, in writing, each vendor’s capability today, where each vendor is going with research and development, and what is each vendor’s expectation in meeting the threshold and going beyond.  Vendors are encouraged to provide data samples.  Comments will be provided to those who provide data samples.

The sensor phenomenology and performance specifications are: HRTE (High Resolution Terrain Data) 5-6 (1.0 m to 0.3 m horizontal resolution, 0.3 to 0.1 m vertical resolution) with an absolute accuracy of 10 cm (3D RMS 1 sigma) at a stand off range of 10,000 (NGA’s threshold) to 60,000 ft (NGA’s goal) and an area rate of 100 km2 (threshold) to 500 km2 (goal) at HRTE-5 from a fixed wing aerial platform. The vendors should state if they are able to meet the specifications.  If they are not, then the vendors should state how close they are to the specifications.  For example, can the vendor meet the expectation at a lower altitude?  If not at a lower altitude, then what can the vendor achieve?  NGA will consider long term research and development investment to work toward these specifications, threshold and goal.

NGA InnoVision’s Sensor Physics Office may use Federally Funded Research and Development Corporation (FFRDC) personnel to evaluate any information provided under the RFI.

All parties interested in responding to this RFI are requested to submit the requested information by December 15, 2005 to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive Reston, Virginia 20190, to the attention of Mr. Eric Rauch. Direct any questions or comments to Mr. Rauch at Eric.Rauch@nga.mil.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development and Mission Concept Studies NASA Research Announcement NNH05ZDA001N-ASTID under the OSS ROSES 2005 Solicitation. Description: NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC)is seeking other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) partners for the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development and Mission Concept Studies NASA Research Announcement (NRA) (see http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={614C2109- 0768-07EF-D96F-32627F1BD24E}&stack=push The ASTID program element requests proposals to develop instrumentation capabilities that will help meet Astrobiology science requirements on future space flight missions, as well as unique Astrobiology science objectives on Earth.  Selected activities are expected to advance the development of scientific instruments or instrument components to the point where the instruments could be credibly proposed in response to future flight opportunity announcements, although proposals to build flight-qualified hardware are not a part of this program element.  In addition, the development of laboratory instruments designed to open a new area of study for Astrobiology will also be considered. In addition, this program element also solicits proposals for Astrobiology mission concepts that may help increase the pool of ideas that may be considered for mission planning, as well as take advantage of mission opportunities such as offered by NASA’s Discovery (http://discovery.nasa.gov/), Explorer (http://fpd.gsfc.nasa.gov/410/), and New Frontiers Programs (http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/newfrontiers/). Pending the approval of NASA's Fiscal Year 2006 budget, approximately $6M may be available for this year’s support of selections for the ASTID program.	Awards are expected to range from $30K to $300K per year, for a maximum of three years. For mission concept studies, approximately 5-7 studies may be selected for funding, each at the level of $100K - $150K.  For additional information on the scientific goals and objectives of NASA’s Astrobiology program refer to the Astrobiology Roadmap, which is available on the Astrobiology web site at http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap.   LaRC is seeking partners to participate with a NASA LaRC Principal Investigator (PI) in the ASTID Program to develop a	proposal and assist with instrument definition and development. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide the instrument components consistent with the efforts synopsized for the specified LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criteria evaluates the proposer’s relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criteria evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Specifically, NASA LaRC is seeking partners to participate with the NASA LaRC Prinicpal Investigator (PI) in the ASTID Program to develop a proposal for the following:   Energy Dispersive Detectors for use in X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers; Technical Point of Contact: Warren C. Kelliher, 757-864-4172, warren.c.kelliher@nasa.gov LaRC is actively developing X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers (XRFS) for use on future Planetary and Space Exploratory missions to provide elemental analysis of various regolith surfaces. Based on previous experience with the XRFS used on the Viking Mission to Mars, LaRC is developing state-of-the-art XRFS components to be used in different instrument configurations for in-situ analysis, remote surface analysis and subsurface analysis. LaRC is also interested in further development of micro and total reflection XRFS technologies for space applications. For this specific proposal, LaRC is interested in developing new energy dispersive detectors for use in an XRFS that are not sensitive to the visible light spectrum, yet still have reasonable sensitivity to the low fluorescence energies of the biogenic elements such as Carbon, Nitrogen & Oxygen. LaRC is particularly interested in the radiation resistant, wide bandgap, semiconductor single crystals such as Diamond and Silicon Carbide. LaRC is interested in partners with the capability of growing and doping these crystals and assisting in the evaluation of their use as an energy dispersive detector for the x-ray photon region as well as participating in the development of the formal proposal to the ASTID Solicitation. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses shall be submitted electronically via e-mail by 5:00 local time, November 16, 2005 to: Gaudy M. Bezos-OConnor, at Gaudy.M.Bezos-Oconnor@nasa.gov.  Technical Questions should be directed to Warren C. Kelliher at the email address above, or 757-864-4172.  Procurement questions should be directed to: Nancy Sessoms via e-mail at Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov or (757) 864-2471; or in her absence to:  Liliana J. Richwine via e-mail at Liliana.J.Richwine@nasa.gov or (757) 864-2478.

<SUBJECT>23--Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Platform Systems Demonstration (PSD)
<SOLNBR>W56HZV-06-X-ZZ01
<RESPDATE>112905
<ARCHDATE>01282006
<CONTACT>Jeffrey Bean, 586-574-7860
<DESC>The PSD is one part of the U.S. Army's three-part plan to transform its Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) fleet to attain future fleet capabilities and achieve Army modularity requirements while supporting current operations and fleets. The TWV fleet tr ansformation operates under four overarching goals: improved safety; improved survivability; increased reliability, maintainability, and supportability; and enhanced distribution and mission capabilities. A PSD of industry's available and complete integrat ed vehicle solutions will help the Army develop and refine realistic requirements for improved current and future tactical vehicles.    First, a near-term effort includes rebuilding and improving the current fleet, called recapitalization or RECAP.  RECAP goes beyond returning a vehicle to zero miles/zero hours and brings vehicles up to the current production configuration to the maximum e xtent possible.  A second near-term effort involves inserting advanced industry-developed component technology into current vehicles under the Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP), which is explained at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/EMIP%20Web%20Oct0 5%20ver%204.doc.  EMIP inserts advanced technologies as quickly as possible into current vehicles. Although all concepts are considered, this process addresses only those technologies that can be production-ready six months after verification testing is completed. There is also a long-term component of EMIP in that it will also identify future capabilities that can be inserted into new production vehicles produced in the future.   The third effort involves activities that will lead to developing and refining realistic requirements for improved current and future tactical vehicles. The objective of one of these activities, the Future Tactical Truck Systems Advanced Concepts Technolog y Demonstration, is to  assess key technologies and emerging Future Army sustainment concepts in developing requirements of optimized vehicles for the future force.  The TWV PSD is another of these activities. It involves demonstrating alternate TWV soluti ons with the purpose of considering available complete integrated vehicle solutions relative to the Army's needs. The demonstration will take place in the fourth quarter FY 2006 timeframe, at a location to be determined.  Only complete vehicles and trailers will be considered. The vehicles may be improvements or derivatives of current Army vehicles, other vehicles cur rently in production either domestically or abroad for military or commercial purposes, or existing prototype vehicles. They may be any size or weight class that meets the Army's needs. The PSD is intended to consider complete integrated vehicle and traile r solutions, not selected technologies (individually or collectively) placed on an automotive platform. Again, technology candidates will only be considered through the EMIP process.   The demonstration has not been fully defined. It is anticipated that it will involve a number of activities designed to demonstrate the vehicle's capabilities with an emphasis on demonstrating observable, measurable characteristics related to the needs/cap abilities set forth at the PSD website. It is anticipated these will include characteristics related to transportability, sustainability, convoy operations, improved load handling and C4ISR/situational awareness. A TWV PSD website has been established at h ttp://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/twv_psd/twv_psd.htm . Its contents include the needs and capabilities the Army seeks to demonstrate during the PSD as referenced in this announcement. Respondents are required to review the information posted at the web site prior to responding.  Additional information will be provided either directly to respondents or by posting to the website.  The Army will provide test sites and limited facilities at no expense to participants. All other costs shall be borne by the participant.  Thes e costs include vehicle build, preparation, and shipment to and from test sites; vehicle operation, maintenance, repair; sustainment, and documentation and training for government personnel (if required). The Army will not reimburse participants for any ex penses. Data collection may be accomplished by the Army, by participants, or jointly. Participants may be required to enter into agreements concerning the rights and obligations of each party as a condition of participation. Vehicles will be required to me et requirements for safe operation.  Participation is entirely voluntary. Although it is not a condition of participation, teaming is encouraged. Foreign-made vehicles are permitted to participate, however, all transport and import costs will be borne by the participant. Additionally, foreign  individuals or companies may have to comply with restricted access to test sites or information.  This demonstration is a requirements development and refinement activity - not a competition. The Army is looking to see how industry's integrated solutions can help address Army TWV capability gaps. Any Army-funded development or production based on the r esulting requirements documents will be acquired in accordance with all relevant contracting requirements. Participation in this demonstration is not required for participation in subsequent acquisitions. This announcement seeks to gauge interest and seek potential participants. Responses will also provide the Army with information to finalize demonstration planning. Participants must provide:  1) A brief description of the vehicle to be demonstrated. 2) A specification sheet for the vehicle to be demonstrated.  3) A brief explanation of how the vehicle meets the Army's future needs, including which of the capabilities and to what extent the vehicle meets them, and what capabilities are significantly less than the corresponding current vehicles if any.  Include an  explanation of any capability tradeoffs made in arriving at the vehicle's design. Identify team members and capability contributions. The needs and capabilities are posted at the TWV PSD Web site http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/twv_psd/twv_psd.htm . 4) Identify the responding organization and contacts for technical and administrative purposes.  Identify team members and their contributions.  5) Identify any foreign team members, foreign organizations, and foreign national key personnel.   The Army has limited resources to conduct the demonstration. Therefore, it may be necessary to require qualification or to place limitations on the number of participants or the extent or duration of each participant's role in the demonstration based on th e number and type of responses received. Any qualifications or limitations will be provided to respondents to this announcement.  Send your response via e-mail to Jeffrey Bean at jeffrey.r.bean@us.army.mil, NLT 29 Nov 05. Incomplete responses or responses received after this date may not be considered.

<SUBJECT>10--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>16--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>24--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>32--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>40--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>47--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>55--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>63--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>71--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>78--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>87--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>96--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>F--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>N--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>V--Special Notice, New Internet Reporting System For Small Business Subcontracting
<DESC>As of October 28, 2005 the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) is available for use by all civilian agencies and their contractors required to report subcontracting accomplishments at www.esrs.gov.  The eSRS is now functioning at the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) level, which will allow the civilian contractors to enter their Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contracts (formerly the SF-294) and Summary Subcontract Reports (formerly the SF-295). The eSRS is the latest system under the umbrella of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  On October 18, 2004, and March 18, 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance regarding the status of the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS).  The second memorandum authorized agencies to grant, at their discretion, a 60-day extension for contractors to file their reports.  Where agencies choose to exercise this authorization, their contractors' reports would be due 60 days after IOC.  However, implementation of the eSRS for the Department of Defense contractors is targeted for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Accordingly, all Department of Defense contractors are to continue to submit SF-294s and/or SF-295s in accordance with the instructions found in their contract clauses.  We will provide a formal notice, similar to this, when the eSRS becomes available for the use by Department of Defense contractors.  We do recognize that some confusion may occur regarding the due dates and submission of reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, especially since Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports in accordance with the corresponding submission schedule.  In order to minimize this confusion, we have coordinated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the following guidance: Except as noted above, all civilian contractors must now submit their Summary Subcontract Reports for fiscal year 2004 into the eSRS.  Contractors of the General Services Administration (GSA) holding contracts with the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and contractors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that have entered their fiscal year 2004 reports into the GSA FSS and NASA electronic reporting systems, respectively, will be exempt from this requirement.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract into the eSRS for fiscal year 2004.  No contractors of any agency will be required to submit mid-year reports for fiscal year 2005 (normally due April 30 for the period ended March 31st) into the eSRS.  This exemption applies to both the Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract and the Summary Subcontract Reports.  Civilian contractors of all agencies will be required to submit end of year reports for both the Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract for fiscal year 2005 (normally due October 30 for the period ended September 30th) into the eSRS, within 60 days of the eSRS becoming available for use, i.e. by December 31.  Department of Defense contractors will continue to submit paper reports until they receive official notification from their Contracting Officers or Contracting Authority to begin using the eSRS.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation currently requires a final report (SF-294) at contract completion.  Civilian contractors that have not yet submitted a final SF-294 for any contracts closed during FY 2004 or FY 2005 should do so now using the eSRS.  If there is any question regarding reporting of your Summary Subcontract Reports and Subcontracting Reports for Individual Contract please contact your cognizant contracting officer or official for help.  Frequently Asked Questions and other information are available on the eSRS web site at www.esrs.gov.  If you have any further questions or comments, you may contact the SBA at eSRS@sba.gov or the IAE at integrated.acquistion@gsa.gov.

SOLIDWORKS SOFTWARE REQUEST FOR QUOTE CLARIFICATION
(FOR PR F3QCCM5277A200)

Several questions arose from vendors regarding the above SolidWorks software and training Request for Quote (RFQ), and below is a summary of the answers to those questions for your information and clarification.  

1)  CURRENT SOLIDWORKS SOFTWARE BEING USED:
The current 13 SolidWorks seats already being used by the Government are on a network with a current subscription service for annual maintenance good through FY06.        
 
2)  VERSION OF SOFTWARE BEING REQUESTED:
The 2005 version with maintenance is currently running for the 13 seats already being used.  The 2006 version of the software (with floating license) is being requested in this RFQ along with maintenance -- for all nine new seats being requested (7 - Professional & 2 - Premium).
 
3)  PREMIUM TRAINING:
Regarding SolidWorks Office Premium training -- training for COSMOS is not needed at this time, but include Routing training.  Routing & COSMOS capabilities are inherent to the software and will not affect the licenses themselves -- the users may or may not actually access that part of the software.  But for training purposes, include Routing.

4)  ON-SITE TRAINING CLASSES:
Each of the on-site training classes are to be taught to train nine people total; two classes each are to be taught for both basic and advanced training -- one class of five people, one class of four people.  A room in which to conduct the training will be provided by the Government, but vendors are expected to furnish everything else to conduct the training classes.  The training area does not have a screen, projector, or white board.      

5)  PDM IMPLEMENTATION SERVICE:
PDM Implementation Service not needed on-site at this time; it may be requested in a separate RFQ in the future.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SOLAR SIMULATOR, CLASS-A.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions asked before the due date. Question 1.  item 1 specifies 1300 watt bulb and a 1.6KW Solar Simulator. I assume this is a 1.6 KW Simulator and running at 1300 watts?  Answer: Yes, the solar simulator will handle a 1600 watt lamp so that we may increase our output beyond a 1 solar contant for diverging beams larger than 6 inches. Question 2. item 3 and item 4 specifies aperture set for a 4” lens housing, Since this is a 6” x 6” Simulator, do we configure the apertures to mount on the larger lens housing?  Answer:  The final lens housing supports a 6 inch lens assembly.  Typically, most manufactures use a smaller lens housing, while the beam is diverging, prior to final lens assembly to take advantage of using smaller filters, aperatures, optics and mirrors. If a company wants to use larger apertures, it is okay. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on November 2, 2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
