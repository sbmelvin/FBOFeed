<DESC>This RFI requests industry's input to address possible near-term (< 5 years) technology development initiatives that will deliver or enhance CDL capability as described in paragraph two below.  Please describe, in detail, existing and potential CDL related initiatives that can be rapidly prototyped and disseminated to the field for operational use.  Based on inputs received the CDL Program Management Office has tentatively scheduled Industry Information Exchange Day(s) for 4-6 May 2010.

The CDL EA, OUSD(I) and the joint service representatives are interested in information and efforts in the following three major areas: (NOTE:  Examples listed below are suggestions and not intended to restrict submissions)
   a. Evolutionary terminal development: Development of a tactical Network-CDL (N-CDL) spoke terminal; Further terminal miniaturization to accommodate Size, Weight and Power restricted UAVs of < 30 lbs; Frequency flexible terminals (other than Ku/X band); Development of mesh network technology; Development of a Discovery CDL(D-CDL) terminal concept

   b. Suggested changes to CDL waveform applications at the data link layer: Solutions for efficient use of spectrum in Ku restricted host nations; Application of pulsed mode CDL; CDL and micro digital data link interoperability; High data rate solutions; Forward error correction of modulation data and multipath mitigation
   c. Advanced CDL technology insertion (prioritized by warfighter need): Demonstrations proving terminal performance beyond what's currently available (other bands, high data rates, phased array antenna, networking, etc.); Studies including development of CDL certification test equipment for advanced waveforms and related joint interoperability certification; Dual use technology for line of sight and beyond line of sight comms; Anti-jam, low probability of intercept/detection enhancements
Please refer to the attached documents for further information.

<DESC>On behalf of SAF/AQ, the CDL Executive Agent, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Intelligence, the CDL Program Management Office (PMO) is seeking potential sources capable of providing specification support for the CDL family of waveforms and North Atlantic Treaty Organization Standard Agreement documents (NATO STANAG) 7085 and 4586, and other standards as appropriate. CDL is the Department of Defense (DoD) standard for all airborne manned and unmanned platforms with Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions. STANAG 7085 provides the interoperability standards for three classes of data links used for NATO ISR data transmission and STANAG 4586 outlines the standard interface of the Unmanned Control System for NATO unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) interoperability.
The CDL PMO is seeking potential sources that are interested and capable of providing Specification Support in the following areas: a) Specification Support; b) CDL Program Support; c) Program Management; d) Security and Privacy; e) Verification and Validation. Sources should consider their ability to incorporate multiple CDL vendors' expertise in analyzing and upgrading the specification, their ability to provide robust verification/validation of CDL specifications, and their ability to perform studies and analyses, as needed, throughout specification development.
Please refer to the attached Request for Information (RFI) document for further information.

<CONTACT>DARPA-BAA-10-48 Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-10-48@DARPA.MIL
<DESC>Please see the Attached PDF for the full Broad Agency Announcement details.&nbsp; The program summary of this BAA is as follows:<br />The Sferics-based Underground Geopositioning (S-BUG) program seeks to counter the inability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide mapping (i.e., surveying) and navigation for personnel or equipment in underground facilities, tunnels, building basements, and caves. The goal of the program is to develop globally-robust underground geopositioning technology based on signals-of-opportunity (SoOP) and to produce a non-form/fit functional prototype for a demonstration of the capability.
<p>The SoOP can be natural signals such as atmospheric signals ("sferics") generated by worldwide lightning strikes, gravity fields and geomagnetic noise, and manmade radio emitters not originally intended for underground location and navigation (such as communications transmissions).  While the SoOP may be augmented for time synchronization or signal calibration purposes by through-the-earth (TTE) communications or other transmissions, the development of navigation beacons is not a focus of this program. The navigation system may include additional navigation sensors (e.g., an inertial navigation unit) to aid the navigation solution, but absolute geopositioning is expected to come from SoOP.<br />In Phase 1 of the S-BUG program, above- and below-ground sferics signals were collected to evaluate the feasibility of using sferics as a globally-ubiquitous SoOP for underground navigation.  Preliminary analysis indicates that both horizontal and vertical (depth through the earth) position estimates with GPS-quality location accuracies are achievable. <br />To meet the S-BUG program goals, DARPA seeks innovative proposals for the design, development, and demonstration of a SoOP-based non-form/fit prototype for non-real-time mapping/surveying missions and real time navigation underground.   Proposals are expected to address all of the following technology areas: receiver and processing hardware, signal processing and navigation algorithms, system performance modeling, and systems integration.<br />This BAA is soliciting proposals for Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the S-BUG program. Compliant submissions require a full technical proposal encompassing the technical areas <br />described above and full cost proposals for Phase 2 (Base) and Phase 3 (Option 1).</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT - THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 TO ISSUE A TASK ORDER FOR ENGINEERINGSUPPORT SERVICES UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AWARDED, COMPETITIVE 8(a) CONTRACT NNC06BA07B WITHASRC AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. BACKGROUND:  NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has committed support for specific effortsunder the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.  The specific area ofsupport for this task, per NASAs Recovery Act Program for Aeronautics Research, is toextend flight research of adaptive control technologies to prevent loss-of-control. Aircraft Icing is specified in the Aviation Safety Programs Integrated ResilientAircraft Control project as one of several adverse conditions that would likely lead toreduced aircraft control effectiveness or possibly loss of control.  Such conditionscould be addressed through the application of advanced aircraft control methods.  Currentautomated aircraft control methods do not account for degraded aircraft performance andoperation due to icing.In order to develop, verify, and validate the advanced control methods that might beemployed to mitigate the hazardous effects of aircraft icing, simulations of aircraftflight in icing conditions must be conducted.NASA GRC intends to issue a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B to procureengineering services to support the design efforts for artificial ice shapes to be usedin a wind tunnel test to determine aerodynamic effects of ice accreted on an aircraftmodel.	Aerodynamics is the motion of air as it interacts with an aircraft in flight.  Toobtain the iced-aircraft aerodynamics for the simulations, a plan has been developed toconduct wind tunnel experiments using a subscale model aircraft appropriately fitted withartificial ice shapes.	These artificial ice shapes must be expertly designed, built,attached to the subscale model aircraft, and verified.	Experience and specializedknowledge of the effects of icing on aerodynamics is required to perform this task.  Iceaccumulated on an aircraft during flight through clouds at certain conditions disruptsthe air flow around the aircraft.  This task will require the design of artificial iceshapes for the leading edges of the main wings, the horizontal tailplane, and thevertical tailplane.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br /><br /> Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, 	Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description:<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to procure on a sole source basis with PeproTech Inc., Princeton Business Park, P.O. Box 275, Rocky Hill, NJ 08553 for recombinant human IL-15.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)  using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to acquire 110 mg of recombinant human IL-15 for two SIV vaccine studies, as one important component of developing an HIV mucosal vaccine.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide 110 mg of recombinant human IL-15, which should have the same quality as the IL-15 as used in the previous cohort so that NCI can compare the results with the previous cohort:</p>
<p>&bull;	biological activity as defined by stimulation of proliferation of CTLL-2 cells with an ED50 of &le; 0.5 ng/ml <br />&bull;	corresponding to a specific activity of &ge; 2 x 106 units/mg in this assay</p>
<p>Furthermore, the E. coli-derived recombinant IL-15 should start with the N-terminal Methionine residue before the Asn49 residue.</p>
<p>The IL-15 is needed for an SIV vaccine study that is based on a previous study NCI carried out using IL-15 from Peprotech.  Market research found that IL-15 from different sources has been found to have different specific activity, which would affect the dosing.  Because the new study is built on the previous one, NCI must be able to use comparable levels of specific activity and to be able to compare the results. Therefore, NCI needs to obtain the IL-15 from the same source as that used in the previous study, namely PeproTech.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to solicit proposals form qualified organizations to conduct a multicenter prospective, observational study:  The primary goals of this study are to acquire reliable and valid data to: (1) establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age; (2) create an individualized standard for optimal fetal growth and size; (3) improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation based on ultrasound measures; and (4) construct an individualized standard for fundal height.
The secondary goals of this study are to: (1) recruit a cohort of women with a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus because of pregravid obesity and collect blood samples for etiologic research; (2) recruit a cohort of twin pregnancies with a similar number of monochorionic and dichorionic twins; (3) obtain blood samples for a prediction study of fetal growth restriction and/or overgrowth; and (4) obtain placental tissues and cord blood in selected cases and controls for studies on etiology of idiopathic fetal growth restriction, and in all twin gestations.  

The Government is currently conducting a multicenter prospective study to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth. The study aims to recruit (1) 2,400 low risk women with an equal number of White, Hispanic, African American and Asian race/ethnicity; (2) 600 obese women; and (3) 250 monochorionic and 250 dichorionic twin pregnancies.  Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive 5 scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3 dimensional (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.   Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.   After delivery neonatal anthropometic measures will be carefully taken.   Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.   Blood samples will be collected at enrollment, at 16 to 18 weeks, 24 to 28 weeks in all subjects and at 6 weeks postpartum in selected subjects.  Placental tissues will be collected in selected subjects.   

The purpose of this acquisition is to recruit up to four additional clinical centers in the U.S. to participate in the ongoing study. Currently the following four sites were awarded contracts in 2008:   Columbia University, Medical University of South Carolina, Northwestern University and University of California at Irvine.

Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent. 
Proposed Issue Date:  March 30, 2010
Title of Project:   Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams Removal
Location of Project:  These dams are located on the Elwha River within or near Olympic National Park near Port Angeles, Washington.
A Pre-solicitation Conference and site visit is expected to occur the week of April 19, 2010 at Port Angeles Washington and the project sites.   The date, time and location will be in the upcoming solicitation. Both dams are active hydroelectric facilities and have restricted access.  Attendees will be escorted through facilities in groups of 10-12 people.  Accordingly, to reserve a space for this site visit, all interested parties must contact Audrey Winters, Contract Specialist via e-mail; audrey_winters@nps.gov by COB April 13, 2010.
Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract, using best value source selection procedures, will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The Government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.  
Estimated price range: $40 million to $ 60 million.
Time for completion, approximately 3.5 years (2011 - 2014). 
Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
Description:  The work of this contract consists of The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, will solicit for proposals on or about March 30, 2010 for the complete removal of two concrete dam structures as part of the Elwha River and Fisheries Restoration Project.   These dams are located on the Elwha River within or near Olympic National Park near Port Angeles Washington.   Funding is currently available and the solicitation will be a full and open competition.  Proposal submissions will be due mid-May 2010 and contract award is anticipated to occur in August 2010. Notice to Proceed for the removal of the gravity dam and gate structures at Elwha and the arch dam at Glines Canyon is expected to occur in September 2011.  A Notice to Proceed for mobilization and road improvement may be available earlier, depending on the successful offeror's construction schedule.  The construction contract duration is expected to be three years from the September 2011 Notice to Proceed. 
Elwha Dam is located outside Olympic National Park (Park) and is a concrete gravity dam with a structural height of 108 feet.  Glines Canyon Dam is located approximately 8.5 river miles upstream from Elwha Dam.  It is a 210 foot high concrete arch dam and is located within Olympic National Park.  The Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams removal contract will require the contractor to improve as needed and maintain construction access roads; safely remove both dams; accommodate continuous river flows during dam removal; facilitate sediment management through controlled drawdown rates and releases; and remove approximately 7 miles of overhead power line;.  Continuous river flows are anticipated to be maintained by passing flow through the existing spillways and penstocks as long as possible, then using water diversion and/or notching of the concrete dams when the dam elevations become too low for use of the penstock and spillways.  
This contract will involve the demolition and disposal of a large volume of concrete; significant water diversion and control of river activities; removal and disposal of large mechanical and electrical equipment from a power house and associated facilities; placing and grading of embankment; removal of contaminated soils; removal of lead based paint; removal of a power line, power poles, and transformer yards; and access road improvements and maintenance.  These roads will include Olympic Hot Springs Road from the Park boundary to the Glines Canyon Dam removal sites (including the portion of Whiskey Bend Road needed to complete contract work) and Lower Dam Road to the Elwha Dam site.
The basic concept for removing the dams includes lowering the reservoirs at a controlled rate to avoid mobilizing landslides and to redistribute reservoir sediments for controlled release and long term stability.  This project has significant environmental compliance requirements including seasonal work restrictions for fish protection.  There are 3 periods of each year where the contractor will not be allowed to release sediments into the downstream river channels.  These are May 1 through June 30, August 1 through September 14, and November 1 through December 31.  The volume of sediment released at any one time will also be limited by the capacity of a downstream sediment removal plant (operated by others), built to mitigate water quality during this project.
At the Elwha Dam site, the dam and all associated appurtenances are to be demolished and removed or buried onsite (only select concrete will be allowed to be buried onsite) and embankment will be placed to restore the site to near pre-dam appearance.  Appurtenances include, but are not limited to, power plant and all mechanical equipment, a transformer yard, penstocks, spillway gates, and wood frame outbuildings.  
At Glines Canyon the arch section of the dam will be completely removed to restore the river to near pre-dam conditions.  The penstock gate house, surge tank, powerhouse tailrace wall and transformer yard will also be removed.  The removal of the downstream penstock and powerhouse will be a bid option.  If the powerhouse and penstock are not removed, the draft tubes will be plugged and metal plates will be installed over windows to secure the site.  
The gated spillway section, including the radial gates, and the right abutment thrustblock will be retained.  Safety handrails will be installed on the concrete thrust block on the right abutment, and the gated spillway on the left abutment, for future use as a public overlooks.  Excavation and site grading will be done.  All demolished material will be removed and properly disposed of outside of the Park.  
The overhead power line between the two dams, as well as the power poles will be removed and disposed of.  Specific poles containing other co-located utilities will be retained and only the contract power line will be removed from those poles.  The power line length is approximately 7 miles, traversing through rugged terrain.  Some poles may be accessed from public highway.  Others will be accessed along a power line right of way.  There are a small number of poles that cannot be accessed by vehicle.
Hazardous waste removal at each site will consist of removal and disposal of contaminated soils, asbestos containing materials, coatings containing hazardous material (lead), and polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs).  Hazardous waste mitigation, with the exception of removal of lead containing paint, was done prior to the Federal government purchase of the Elwha and Glines Canyon facilities in 2000.  Work under this specification is for the removal of any remaining materials.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Honduras (USAID/Honduras), Office of Democracy and Governance (DG), requests the services of a contractor to undertake a new five year-program, the goal of which is to strengthen Honduran democracy in approximately thirty-five municipalities by increasing citizen satisfaction with and participation in creating a more transparent, accountable government. This will be achieved through supporting decentralized, democratic government-provided or -regulated services to improve service delivery; increase local government capacity to oversee decentralized services and respond to citizen feedback; provide mechanisms through which civil society can engage with local governments and service providers to express their concerns; and improve the capacity of the national government and institutions to implement laws and regulations to further enhance decentralization. The program will operate at the local level, thereby benefitting primarily rural poor populations, and increasing the participation of politically and/or economically excluded citizens in democratic processes to bring about a direct improvement in their lives.
<p>The contractor will design and implement a program that strengthens democracy in Honduras by increasing citizen satisfaction with and participation in decentralized, democratic government through improved service delivery in the health sector to gradually lead to improved priority services identified by the target communities. It is expected that these actions will result in more transparent, accountable government. To achieve these ends, the contractor will undertake activities in four core component areas: 1) Civil society advocacy for improved local services increased; 2) Local institutional capacity to deliver decentralized services strengthened 3)Structures and systems to implement reform strengthened; and 4) Small Grants mechanism to administer, fund, and evaluate activities with partner organizations.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for Mechical Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) Contractor at the John C. Kluzyniski (JCK) Federal Building &amp; US Loop Post Office (LPO) Facility, Chicago, IL. <br /> <br /> THIS WILL NOT BE AN OPEN MARKET PROCUREMENT. A JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 6.302-1, ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AND NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.
<p>Due to the massive amount of coordination necessary between the O&amp;M contractor and current construction contractor, the GSA has determinted that Pepper Construction, the currenct CMc (Construction Manager as Contractor) contractor is the only firm that has been identified as a source.</p>
<p>Specific examples where extensive communication and coordination will be needed include but are not limited to the following: <br /> The construction contractor will need to conduct multiple drain downs and refills of the secondary hydronic water loop in order to install new HVAC operating equipment. It is imperative these actions are closely coordinated between the installers and operators so normal operating temperatures may be reached at the start of each business day. The tenant's thermal environment must be ensured as to guarantee normal operating conditions and allow them to effectively carry out their Agency specific mission.</p>
<p>Due to various HVAC operating equipment being out of commission at any given time, the communication and coordination between installers and operators is imperative. As equipment is taken out of service for replacement, other means of environmental control will need to be implemented. HVAC equipment will need to be manipulated in order to provide the required environmental condition required for tenant comfort. If this is not done in close coordination we will have areas in the building that will not be properly conditioned. Conversely this presents the potential for wasteful energy use if equipment is not manually shut down during off hours.</p>
<p>As new HVAC equipment is installed and put in service, inspections and tours must be conducted to ensure proper operation. If the General Contractor is responsible for all operation &amp; maintenance, they can not shirk the responsibility or blame another party for not operating the equipment properly or making changes to the proper operating plan.</p>
<p>Also equipment warranty periods may be compromised if a separate operation &amp; maintenance contractor is responsible for newly installed equipment. The General Contractor should be responsible for all maintenance of equipment under warranty. If they are responsible for ALL maintenance, this situation may be avoided.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will be tasked with providing performance based mechanical operations and maintenance services to ensure the safety of the building mechanical operations and to maintain the building assets. The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, repair parts, tools and equipment for the mechanical operations and maintenance services. Work includes the operation, maintenance, inspection, and testing of all mechanical systems at the JCK and LPO, with the exception of the fire alarm. The Contractor shall be responsible only for the operation of the fire alarm system, not for maintenance or repairs.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considerd by the GSA.</span> </strong></p>

The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to issue a solicitation for multiple award indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for environmental remediation and decommissioning services. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or around March 3, 2009. The Government intends to award three contracts from this solicitation. The first award will be made to a service disabled veteran owned (SDVO) small business and the other two awards will be made on a full and open basis. The services to be performed are an integral part of environmental remediation activities undertaken by the Volpe Center in support of organizations within the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other Volpe Center sponsors including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and FAR Part 37, Service Contracting. Individual Task Orders (TOs) under the resulting contracts will be issued on the basis of Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) term form or CPFF completion form.

<a href="mailto:melissa.k.koehn@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Design Build Contract, a long-term remedy for the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans area.  The purpose of the project is to provide storm surge risk reduction for the areas near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals from the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge, while not impeding the ability of the areas internal drainage system to function.  This includes design and construction of independent permanent gated storm surge barriers and pump stations at the discharge end of each canal.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacities of the three canals are: 17th Street, 12,500 cubic feet per second (cfs); Orleans Avenue, 2,700 cfs and London Avenue, 9,000 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234.  The existing Interim Closure Structures shall remain operational during the construction phase of the new pump stations.  The most technically effective means of accomplishing the dual purpose of storm surge risk reduction and simultaneous evacuation of storm water should be given highest consideration by offerors.  The contract will require a performance bond and payment bond for the design and construction effort, but the pumps, pump drivers, and generators may not necessarily be included in the bonding requirements.  The equipment may be procured under separate supply line items in the design-build contract.  Offerors may choose to take advantage of this arrangement by omitting the equipment from their bonds, but are not obligated to do so.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 237990 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $33.5 M.  An acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required for award.  It is anticipated that the RFP - Phase I (Request for Proposal  RFP I) will be issued April 2010, with the issuance of a Draft RFP  Phase II to the short-listed firms in the 2nd  Quarter of CY2010.  The estimated range of construction is over $500 million. However, this Design-Build project will have a build to budget amount.  The Government's intent is to maximize the best value obtainable for that ceiling amount.  In selecting the winning offer in Phase II, technical non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost/price.  However, the contract award for design and construction shall not exceed the ceiling amount.  The selection process will be structured such that offers that optimize technical/management solutions within the contract budget amount will be viewed more favorably than offers that attempt to trade off performance in favor of lower prices.  APPROACH and SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem, the Government intends to procure Design - Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers, Two  Phase Design-Build Selection Procedure (FAR Part 36.3).  In Phase I, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal Phase I and from those respondents, select, based on Past Performance and Technical Approach a short list of three (3) to five (5) firms.  After selection of the short-listed firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP - Phase II, the Government may engage in exchanges of information with the short-listed firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  For example, the Government will issue a draft RFP to the short-listed firms and request their feedback. In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  The Government will then issue RFP - Phase II and from that, select a single technical approach based on the Best Value Continuum Selection Method using the Tradeoff process.  To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the short-listed firms, along with design criteria.  The task of selecting the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the offerors.  It remains the responsibility of the offeror to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach.  Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3 for both phases of the RFP.  The evaluation criteria for Phase I, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Experience; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Approach.  The factors are listed above are all approximately equal in importance.  The evaluation criteria for Phase II, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Management Capability; and (3) Socio Economic Utilization.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD VOSB), HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.  The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR SubPart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting goals for this District are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be places with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBZone SB; (5) 3.5 for VOSB; and (6) at least 2.0% for SD VOSB.  SHARING OF KEY TECHNICAL DATA: The Government intends to provide a stipend in the amount of $500,000 to the Phase II unsuccessful offerors.  Offerors must make it to Phase II in order to be considered for stipend.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals, but a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) to conduct market research IAW FAR Part 10.  The Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) proposes to design and procure a Tactical Video Surveillance System (TVSS).   The tactical employment for TVSS includes two integrated scenarios:  Security (emplaced) and tactical (temporary) force protec-tion; either of which could be short-term or long-term employments.  The TVSS will be another tool for commanders to use in a layered security approach. If successful in the Engineering Development Phase 440 systems may be procured.<BR>TVSS must be a rapidly deployable, compact, man portable, and multiple camera system.  The TVSS must be near real-time day/night camera surveillance system with pan/tilt/zoom capabilities and a monitoring point with a multiple screen display.  The system must be capable of monitoring 16 cameras at one time. The monitoring point must be capable of command, control, monitoring and recording of fixed and slew camera systems.  TVSS must have dual primary and supplemental monitor points for task organization, mission flexibility and redundant survivability.  The TVSS must provide visual surveillance for assessment of designated areas utilizing motion sensor and tracking capabilities. The tracking feature must allow the system to follow a designated moving tar-get within its field of view.  The TVSS must have multiple power capabilities and environmental protection throughout the spectrum of operations.  The TVSS must be modular in design to allow for quick movement (load, unload, transport, set-up or recover) and provide the capability to be re-configured for various conditions and replacement of damaged or lost parts.  <BR>The TVSS must have the ability to deploy three different modular cameras capable of meeting a wide variety of mission requirements and terrain applications.  The TVSS must have both fixed (stare) and slew cameras with quick pan/tilt and zoom capability.  The fixed (stare) cameras are standard range cameras designed to focus on one local area constantly.  The slew cameras are me-dium range cameras designed to pan and tilt to provide surveillance up to company size areas.  The very long range slew cameras are designed to pan and tilt to an area with longer distances for longer range assessment.  <BR>TVSS must be capable of being quickly mounted on lightweight mast systems, on top of buildings, in windows or towers, hidden on the edge of cleared areas and a vehicle mast mount capability for quick operational activation, using the vehicle for power and communications during short term monitoring. Two or three Soldiers must be able to deploy and recover the TVSS rapidly.  The sys-tem must be rugged and operate reliably under austere conditions with environmental extremes of fine particulate dust and temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius to +50 degrees Celsius.<BR>TVSS must monitor designated unattended ground sensors and, if programmed, could slew to indi-vidual sensors for assessment purposes.  Regardless of how the TVSS is programmed, the sensor alarm will be displayed at the TVSS monitor point.  Unattended ground sensors include security sensors, such as Lighting Kit Motion Detector (LKMD), Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS), Chemical, Biological, Radiation and Nuclear (CBRN) detections sensors, sniper detection systems, ground surveillance radar (GSR) and other similar systems to include future video assessment sub-systems.  Interoperability must be obtained through network communications and software to ad-dress and process the information from these systems.<BR>The TVSS must have video motion detection, enabling the system to monitor areas where it is too difficult to emplace other sensors or too dangerous to maneuver.  The TVSS is capable of forward-ing selected critical data to higher headquarters either automatically or by the operators control.  The TVSS capabilities and features give the using unit additional early warning, a tool to develop situational understanding, persistent surveillance capability and the ability to cover high risk areas without exposing Soldiers.<BR><BR>Interested persons or companies may identify their interest and capability, including any available systems on hand, to respond to this requirement with a short description and time necessary to fully meet the requirement. This SSN is neither a Request for Proposal, nor an Invitation to Bid, nor a Request for Quotation. Therefore, this SSN is not to be construed as a commitment by the Govern-ment to enter into a contract nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this SSN. An RFP maybe be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) as a result of this an-nouncement at a later date to be determined. Submit (via e-mail) to brian.murphy3@us.army.mil within ten (10)calendar days of publication of this synopsis.<BR><BR>Point of Contact:   Brian P.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Notice of Intent<br />Ref# 2010-N-11984</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, intents to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 6.302(1), to Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London, SW7 2AZ for a period of nine months.</p>
<p>The INTERSALT project provides unique data in that it is drawn from a large, multi-national population. Results from this project can take advantage of the extensive data already collected and available from the project to investigate the potential use of casual (spot) urine specimens for the estimation of dietary sodium intakes in the population. These results and recommendations can then be applied to large national surveys already collecting spot urine samples, such as NHANES, and provide justification for analyzing urinary sodium content in those samples. Additionally, being able to use spot urine samples as a valid population based measurement will derive substantial cost savings as it is less expensive than 24-hour urine sampling. As a result, this validation project will help the Division to effectively track changes in dietary sodium intake over time in the U.S. population. Effective tracking of these changes are necessary to provide information and guidance to reach Healthy People 2020 goals for reduction in sodium intake, blood pressure improvement and the reduction in cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform a detailed analytic reports from the INTERSALT Project to validate spot-urine collection in population-based surveys to estimate 24-hour sodium (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine excretion. They would provide CDC with recommendations concerning use of predictive equations and spot urinary specimens to estimate individual 24-h Na excretion and Na/K ratio, and average 24-h Na intake and Na/K ratio of the population. Assess size and direction of any bias in these estimates compared with actual (observed) 24-h values. And lastly, provide CDC with recommendations concerning the use of spot urine to estimate dietary sodium intake at the population level. Provide any applicable predictive equations established during the analysis.</p>
<p>The Imperial College of London through its leadership in the INTERSALT and INTERMAP studies is the only entity that can help CDC better define and understand appropriate population level indicators of sodium intake. They have already collected data on over 15,000 persons that wil allow for ability to compare adequacy of a 24-hour urine sample, a spot urine sample and a 24-dietary recall. No other entity has nearly the volume (or statistical power) nor the three components (24 hour urine, spot and dietary recall) available for analysis.</p>
<p>No Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Any interested companies are welcome to submit there credentials and ability to provide the services, via e-mail, ibi9@cdc.gov. Include reference number (2010-N-11984). Send responses by Monday March, 22, 2010.</p>

<DESC>Mechanical Mowing Operations shall be performed by tractor mounted mowing equipment capable of cutting vegetation in the range of diameters found within the designated stands.  Generally herbaceous material and woody vegetation up to 1   diameter range.  Larger diameter stems designated for removal may be within the brushing limits and will be felled by chainsaw or brushsaw if unable to be mechanically treated.  

670-2  EQUIPMENT AND TOOL REQUIREMENTS.  Debrushing operations shall be performed according to item description shown above.

All Items: Tractor mounted mechanized brushing equipment with supplemental hand held power equipment.  A powered cutting machine capable of cutting wood vegetation up to 1   diameter.  Note: I have mostly had 4 wheel drive utility tractors pulling a PTO driven rotary cutting bar such as a Woods, or Bush-Hog. The tractor horse power range in the past has been 35hp or greater and the larger hp tractors can pull a wider mower, up to 8 feet but these areas can also be done with a 5 or 6 foot deck.  I would like to use 4 wheel drive tractors to avoid getting stuck.  I have had a tractor with a front-attached mower deck and that is acceptable.   

Schedule

Notes: I plan to schedule between 140-200 acres annually from the list.  Mowing frequency can be up to two cuttings per year or as infrequent as once every 2 or 3 years.  I started splitting stands into a five year rotation but from what I understood from you, Id make work orders for 2010, 2011, and so on.  The Middlebury and Rochester Districts can be combined into one offer and Manchester would be another offer.  

I have identified 2010 work from the list of areas

<DESC>SUPPLIES SOURCES SOUGHT. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD), has a requirement for an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) for Precipitation Gauges. The period of performance is a one (1) year period. The precipitation gauges have a Capacity of: 0-600 mm (including antifreeze), three (3) sensors - estimated minimum order - 40 each and maximum order - 60 each; Precipitation Gauge, 1000 mm capacity, 3 sensors and signal interfaces minimum order - 1 each and maximum order- 10 each; and Model TH-501 Signal Interfaces (Note three (3) TH-501 interfaces are required for each precipitation gauge) minimum order 123 each and maximum order - 210 each. The HCN-M requirement specifies a commercially available high-accuracy, high-precision weighting-type precipitation gauge that allows for three independent measurements of precipitation. Precipitation rate and accumulation are both key climate variables, and must be measured very accurately under a wide range of ambient conditions. The use of three (3) independent sensors are necessary for the following reasons: 1) Reduced down-time and maintenance costs. If one sensor fails the additional sensors can provide data allowing repair to wait for its regularly scheduled visit; 2) A measure of the uncertainty in the observed value. Individual observations can not provide assessments of their own uncertainty. It is only when multiple independent observations are made that such determinations can be made; and 3) A robust metric to assess instrument drift or related problems. Because of local-scale weather variability, using a neighboring station to indentify instrument drift would require many months for rather large, from a climatologically perspective. The following are requirements for the precipitation gauge: 1) weighing-type; 2) standard data logger-compatible output (analog voltage, or frequency); 3) Ability to have 3 independent transducers; 4) transducers must have transient (lighting and/or electronic shock) protection; 5) accuracy 0.6 mm or better; 6) sensitivity 0.1 mm; 7) Repeatability 0.1 mm; 8) total capacity 600 mm or more; 9) temperature range -25 degrees or low to + 60 degrees or higher; 10) Temperature drift 0.5 mm or better over full operating range; 11) documented track record over several years of field use; 12) high quality UV-resistant white paint over entire exterior and interior of the orifice; 13) simple, rugged mounting on pedestal imbedded in concrete pad and 14) easily cleaned and calibrated. A modernized U.S. Historical Climatology Network is an integrated surface-observing network whose data provide climate, weather, and water information to measure and monitor at a minimum atmospheric essential climate variables (surface air temperature and precipitation) contributing to multiple uses: protect life and property; preserve and extend the climate record of the United States; monitor climate variability and change at a regional level, and provide quality to the Nation's hydro-meteorological forecast, warning and numerical modeling programs. USHCN-M data are derived from sensors whose sitting, exposure, and maintenance adhere to the GCOS Ten Climate Monitoring Principles. USHCN-M ensures the integrity and fidelity of the Nation's regional climate record by modernizing 1,000 USHCN stations. The applicable NAICS code is 334519 with 500 employees. Interested persons may identify their interest by submitting product information and documentation demonstrating the company's capabilities to provide the product. Parties should reference RFQ No. WC133R-10-RQ-0397PY within five (5) business days after publication. If you have questions, please contact Patsy A. Ybarra at (816) 426-6823 or at patsy.a.ybarra@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>E-2 In-Flight Refueling
<SOLNBR>E-2IFR(DKM)
<RESPDATE>032410
<CONTACT>Catherine V. Pickering, Phone 3017579735, Email catherine.pickering@navy.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information for planning purposes. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  Director, Air Warfare (N88) established the requirements baseline for the E-2 In-Flight Refueling (IFR) development program and directed PMA-231 to begin the integration of an IFR system in the E-2D Super Hawkeye. The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and PMA-231 in conducting market research to identify if a commercial off the shelf IFR system will meet these needs or an alternative conceptual solution is available.

The IFR program builds upon the current E-2 aircraft and is designed to introduce modifications to the E-2D platform to achieve an IFR capability.  Incorporation of the IFR capability will expand carrier based airborne early warning, battle management and theater air missile defenses through significantly increased persistence and range.  An IFR capability will enable the E-2 to more effectively support current carrier strike group and joint operations through longer on station times and greater flexibility in stationing aircraft.

In addition to augmenting the current fuel systems with an aerial refueling capability, the E-2 IFR development program will include improvements to Field of View (FOV), handling qualities, exterior lighting and crew stations as necessary to support threshold requirements.  Respondents are encouraged to answer all questions, but it is recognized that some companies may only have a portion of the potential solution.   

In support of assessing current industry capabilities, PMA-231 has sponsored an Analysis of Options (AoO) to perform an E-2 IFR conceptual study looking at alternative industry solutions. To support the AoO, a market survey is being conducted to obtain industry solutions to satisfy PMA-231 requirements. 
 

As a top level summary of some of the required system capabilities, the E-2 with IFR should be capable of meeting the following requirements:

(See Requirements Attachment)

	
Additionally, failure-mode refueling shall be demonstrated for the following scenarios with an F/A-18 E/F tanker:

o	Single engine, gear up at 5,000 ft and 10,000 ft
o	Single engine, gear down at 5,000 ft

Data submitted will be used to evaluate current solutions and alternative conceptual options to perform missions in support of an increased capability.  In addition to data on the candidate system or subsystems, any background that can be provided to evaluate the weight and performance impacts of any modifications that may be required to be fully responsive. The scope of the development effort required to perform the modifications including estimated development cost and schedule, would be useful.  

Industry is requested to provide supporting data to the AoO by answering the following questions with respect to each candidate system and/or subsystem.  Please identify to what standard each attribute is qualified, or the applicable configuration or conditions for the information provided.  If the capability available from the production system differs from that in the question, describe what level of capability is available without modification. Multiple entries from a single vendor are acceptable and encouraged.

<DESC><br />TITLE: Coast Guard HC-144A Operational Flight Trainer (OFT)<br />NAICS: 333319<br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USCG Aviation Training Center, Mobile, AL <br />AGENCY: Naval Warfare Center Training Systems Division, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826, UNITED STATES<br />POC: Steve Coln, Project Manager, Phone 407-380-8159 Email: Stephen.coln@navy.mil
<p>1. DESCRIPTION<br />Naval Warfare Center Training Systems Division, NAWCTSD, is conducting market research, in support of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Flight Training Branch at the Aviation Training Center in Mobile, AL, for the acquisition of one HC-144A Operational Flight Trainer (OFT). NAWCTSD intends to issue a Request for Proposal for the acquisition of the HC-144A OFT. This RFI is for market research to help define the OFT display system field-of-view (FOV) requirements.<br />2. BACKGROUND<br />A description of the intended scope and characteristics of HC-144A OFT acquisition was previously posted on FedBizOps as a "Sources Sought" on 16 March 2009 (Attachment 1). Among the intended requirements for the HC-144A OFT listed in the referenced sources sought notice is a 220-by-60 degree (FOV) cross-cockpit collimated visual display system.<br />3. CONCERN<br />Subsequently to the posting of the referenced sources sought notice, NAWCTSD conducted requirements analysis which included measurements of the actual HC-144A aircraft window FOV and comparisons to display system FOV plots of similar 220&deg; x 60&deg; fielded systems. The analysis indicates that the 220 degree horizontal FOV initially considered for the OFT may be insufficient to support some training tasks for which the USCG ATC Flight Training Branch intends to train in the OFT.<br />4. PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATIO (RFI)<br />The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research into the feasibility, availability, estimated price, and associated risks of an enhanced display system solution that would provide the HC-144A OFT with a FOV that extends beyond the baseline 220&deg; H x 60&deg; V. This would provide a visual system with complete coverage of the aircraft windows FOV. The desired solution would provide an extension to the OFT FOV on the extreme left side of the trainer cockpit (ROM 1 ) and on both sides of the cockpit (ROM 21). The desired solution would ideally extend the display system horizontal FOV for its corresponding window from 110&deg; to approximately 145&deg; and provide preferably complete or at least partial coverage of the corresponding window FOV.<br />5. REFERENCE INFORMATION<br />To assist interested contractors in understanding the stated concern and the desired solution, relevant reference information is being provided as described below. <br />5.1 Sources Sought Synopsis (Attachment 1)<br />The sources sought synopsis previously posted on FedBizOps on 16 March 2009 describing the intended scope and characteristics of the HC-144A OFT acquisition is being provided as Attachment 1.<br />5.2 Baseline System Performance (Attachment 2)<br />The Image Display System section of the Visual System Specification in its current state of development (i.e. pre-solicitation) is also included for reference as Attachment 2. This attachment contains the requirements pertaining to the HC-144A OFT baseline 220&deg; H (-110&deg;/+110&deg;) x 60&deg; V (+20&deg;/-40&deg;) collimated display system as they currently stand. For convenience, the table below summarizes the baseline performance required for the HC-144A OFT with respect to critical performance parameters of the visual system:</p>
<p>TABLE -I. Baseline 220 Visual Display System Performance<br />Critical Parameter Baseline Performance Remarks<br />Field of View from PEP 0&deg; to -110&deg; H<br />+20&deg; to -40&deg; V RFI Area of Concern <br />Field of View from PEP 0&deg; to +110&deg; H<br />+20&deg; to -40&deg; V RFI Area of Concern<br />Minimum Average Highlight Luminance 4 ft-L No less than<br />Maximum Average Black Level Luminance 0.0001 ft-L <br />Minimum Channel Average Contrast Ratio 10:1 No less than<br />Average surface Resolution 6 arc-min/OLP No less than<br />Total Geometric Distortion 1 deg maximum Smaller error desired<br />Relative geometric error from DEP 12 arc-min max within 5&deg;cone Smaller error desired<br />Relative geometric error from PEP and CEP 15 arc-min max within 5&deg;cone Smaller error desired</p>
<p>5.3 Aircraft Windows Layout Photos and FOV Plots (Attachment 3)<br />An attachment containing photographs of the aircraft cockpit windows layout and plots of the actual aircraft window FOV is being provided as Attachment 3.<br />5.4 HC-144A OFT Housing Facility Motion Pad Concrete Slab Data (Attachment 4)<br />The information that is currently available on the HC-144A OFT housing facility motion pad concrete slab characteristics is being provided as Attachment 4.<br />6. INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />Responders are requested to address the following issues in their response:<br />6.1 Technical approach of suggested solution to provide extended FOV <br />Address the following issues with respect to the technical approach of suggested solution to provide extended FOV beyond the baseline requirement of 220&deg; x 60&deg; (e.g. 290&deg; H x 60&deg; V).<br />a. Describe basic technical approach of suggested solution to concern,<br />b. Describe specific technologies, their maturity level, and techniques involved in achieving the suggested solution.<br />6.2 Estimated display system performance of suggested solution <br />Provide information identifying estimated display system performance of suggested solution addressing the following areas:<br />a. Identify instantaneous and total FOV of suggested solution,<br />b. If the increased FOV of suggested solution can not be extended to provide display system complete coverage of the FOV of the aircraft windows at the extreme left and right side of the cockpit, please state. In such case, identify the maximum horizontal and vertical FOV offered by the suggested solution for the desired FOV extensions at each side of the cockpit FOV beyond the baseline requirement of 220&deg; H (-110/+110) by 60&deg; (+20/-40),<br />c. Provide estimated performance of suggested solution for other critical display system parameters besides FOV such as luminance, contrast, resolution, geometric accuracy, and image quality matching across multiple displays,<br />d. Identify any potential undesirable display artifacts that could result from a practical implementation of the suggested solution (e.g. hotspots, dark spots, noticeable seams, altered uniformity, etc.) and means to minimize or overcome such artifacts (e.g., strategic placement of seams, masking of seams, etc.).<br />6.3 Technical challenges associated with suggested solution<br />Identify technical challenges associated with solution, and describe unique design features, special methods, innovative manufacturing techniques, performance trade-offs, industry partnerships, etc. that would enable and make viable the suggested solution.<br />6.4 Potential risks and suggested mitigation approach<br />Identify potential technical, cost, and schedule risks associated with suggested solution and discuss mitigation approach.<br />6.5 Potential impact to other trainer subsystems besides visual system<br />Identify if and how the technical approach and price that would otherwise be proposed for other trainer subsystems, if only the baseline FOV of 220&deg; x 60&deg; were required, would be impacted by the extended FOV solution. For instance: (1) due to increased weight of the extended FOV solution, the motion system may require a different approach, or (2) the facility concrete slab may be impacted due to increased trainer weight.<br />6.6 Price deltas between baseline (220&deg; x 60&deg;) approach and extended FOV solution<br />Two separate Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price estimates are being requested. ROM 1 should address the price of providing the suggested solution for only the left side of the cockpit. ROM 2 should address the price of providing the solution for both sides of the cockpit. Each ROM shall address the price difference between a fully integrated approach that provides only the baseline 220&deg; x 60&deg; FOV and an approach that provides the suggested extended FOV solution. The requested ROMs should be developed for the suggested solution fully integrated into the OFT. The ROMs should address and account for price deltas related to issues such as nonrecurring engineering (NRE), design, development and manufacturing of components unique to the extended FOV solution, additional projectors, image generator (IG) channels, mirrors, modified back projection screen, support structures, etc., as well as price deltas resulting from impact to the design approach for other trainer subsystems. The ROMs should account for the price deltas for efforts related to integration, in-plant set up, tear down and install, transportation, and other support costs to the extent that these efforts are impacted by the suggested extended FOV solution. A breakdown of the ROM price estimates showing major cost elements is desired, but optional.<br />6.7 Estimated schedule impact<br />Identify impact to delivery schedule in terms of the additional time (if any) that would be required to develop and integrate the suggested extended FOV solution with respect to the period of performance necessary to deliver a system with only the baseline 220&deg; x 60&deg; FOV.<br />6.8 Responder's teaming arrangements and technical and management capabilities<br />Identify industry partnerships that the responder would establish in order to develop and deliver the suggested solution. Address specific and relevant experience, expertise, and capabilities of the responder and industry partners to perform and deliver the suggested solution within suggested price and schedule, in accordance with the requirements stated for the desired solution. <br />7.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left; mso-hyphenate: none; tab-stops: -.5in;">The Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks to identify potential sources that are capable of fulfilling the below tasks beginning October 1, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such sources would begin a transition period on August 1, 2010, the anticipated contract award date.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On May 29, 2003 SSA awarded a 5-year contract to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (Mathematica) for preparing data files from SSA administrative data and conducting the adequacy of incentives evaluation, process evaluation, participation analysis, and impact/outcomes analyses for the evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On September 20, 2007, SSA added the Work Incentive Planning and Assistance (WIPA) data collection task to the evaluation contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under that modification, Mathematica subcontracted with Social Solutions to develop the WebData system using Social Solutions' proprietary Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) software.<br /><br />In August of 2009 Congress extended the WIPA projects through September, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In January 2010, SSA asked Congress to extend the program for an additional 5 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, SSA is collecting data for the WIPA program through a subcontract with SSA's evaluation contractor Mathematica.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA intends to modify contract number 0600-03-60130, Evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program - Part A, Evaluation Implementation with Mathematica to extend WIPA data collection through September 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under this modification, Mathematica will continue to maintain a secure, Rehabilitation Act-Section 508 compliant, interactive website to collect information from WIPA cooperative agreement partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the contractor will maintain the database and instructions necessary to capture, store and summarize WIPA-related data elements, assist SSA in developing data table reports from the collected data, provide training materials, and technical assistance on the use of the data collection website.<br /><br />The database shall be maintained such that each WIPA project can successfully enter into and retrieve information from the database employing the principles of "least privilege" and "need to know" to properly restrict access to sensitive data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They will also continue to resolve database problems and problems associated with initial access/registration and two-factor authentication by the individual WIPA projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mathematica will also be required to assist project staff with disabilities in successfully using the data system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br />SSA will no longer use the database for the formal evaluation purposes and so does not intend to extend the data collection through the current evaluation contract beyond September 30, 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA intends to award a new contract to manage the WIPA data collection from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the unknown nature of the funding for the WIPA program, SSA had not expected to collect data beyond September 30, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the complexity of the WIPA data collection system, SSA does not believe these tasks could reasonably be expected to be performed by another offeror before October 1, 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUIREMENTS</span>: Mathematica shall maintain the WIPA data collection website system, shall resolve database-related problems which may arise over the course of the award period, and make any necessary revisions to the system recommended by SSA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Selection of the successful contractor(s) will be based on the Best Value Process, using evaluation criteria to be established in a future RFP. Work under these contracts will be accomplished through the use of FFP Task Orders, which will be competed among the MATOC contractors. Task Orders will vary in size and complexity; however, no single Task Order is expected to exceed $6,000,000.00. The MATOCs will support the U.S. Air Force Medical Services, Health Facilities Division, though they will allow for use by the U.S. Army Medical Command and other customers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. </span></p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking sources to provide Interactive Voice Response Services to The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking sources to implement an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System that can provide disease management to support clinical care to Veteran patient populations receiving care from VHA's Care Coordination Home Telehealth program (CCHT) in all Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). The IVR technology VHA requires will enable automated interactions to help manage the provision of services to Veteran patients and data feeds of disease management data to VHA care coordinators who provide CCHT services. The requirements of this technology include a need for it to allow Veteran patients to retrieve clinical information using IVR from any telephone system.  In addition its solution will provide for the ability to reach CCHT Veteran patients during an emergency or disaster situation.This is not a solicitation announcement.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge and information for the purposes of market research.  Information gained by this SSN may or may not result in a subsequent solicitation. A response to this SSN is not a request to be added to a prospective bidders list or to automatically receive a copy of future solicitations.  Parties that do not provide a response to this SSN will not be restricted from proposing on any future solicitation if and when a solicitation is made available for these services.         Background:  VHA Care Coordination Home Telehealth Program (CCHT) currently supports the care of 41,000 Veteran patients in their own homes using home telehealth technology. The range of conditions covered by this program includes:"	Non institutional care"	Chronic care management"	Acute Care Management"	Health Promotion/Disease PreventionVA has introduced home telehealth technologies with the purpose of making care available, whenever possible in the Veteran patient's home and local community. VA is committed to increasing non-institutional care provision utilizing CCHT to 50,000 Veteran patients by the end of FY2010.  The acquisition of an IVR system that supports disease management will fulfill an urgent business need to expand care for chronic care management in a manner that is not restricted to having a home telehealth hub device and the solution will enable Veteran patients with literacy issues, visual problems and lack of a telecommunications landline to receive care that is otherwise problematic with current technologies.  Purpose and Objectives.   VA's purpose in undertaking this initiative is to secure an ongoing supply of technologies and associated products/services to support VA's enterprise-wide Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT) Programs. The business and clinical requirements for such products that VA identifies within this request for information to support CCHT are indentified for procurement within VA by Office of Telehealth Services (OTS) in VA's Office of Patient Care Services. The support within VA to interface and the associated technical specifications, data definitions and performance requirements that contractors products must meet from an information technologies standpoint have been determined by VA's Office of Information & Technology (OI&T). Within VA these CCHT technology products are usually purchased and distributed through VA's Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services located at individual VA Medical facilities.  The objectives of this solicitation are to ensure the availability of a consistent supply of CCHT technology products within VA for use nationwide in caring for Veteran patients with chronic health-related conditions and in doing so to obtain volume-based pricing.  The CCHT technology requirements that this procurement seeks to fulfill is for  chronic disease management, patient monitoring, patient education and data acquisition  that VA requires in support of routine clinical practice involving telehealth interactions between VA clinicians and Veteran patients (in their homes and/or community settings in which they receive CCHT-based care). VA envisages obtaining IVR products that requires a monthly General Service fee per actively enrolled patient that covers the totality of the costs associated with adding a 3rd party IVR system into VA's standard CCHT care delivery model. All items that are specified by interested parties must be commercially available as telehealth/disease management products. With respect to care support in the home VA seeks a contractor to provide IVR with the requisite data management, support services and information technology services necessary to provide a comprehensive range of CCHT services. The IVR services will act as a data access and communication platform that links Veteran patients receiving CCHT-based care with VA clinicians. These services must support and enable bi-directional transfer of prescribed data, as outlined in this solicitation, from Veteran patients to VA and vice versa.  Such Veteran patients will have been assessed by VA clinicians as appropriate to be managed via CCHT in this way. All patient data will be communicated to VA data systems and VA clinicians by way of secure vendor servers (primary and back-up) situated within the VA.  All contractors for all home telehealth technologies will be required to place suitable data systems behind the VA firewall. All vendor supplied systems and any associated sub-systems that link into these vendor servers must meet VA specified standards for data exchange, specified metrics of quality/timeliness and fully comply with all necessary VA privacy/cyber security requirements. Type of Contract Contemplated:  Indefinite Demand Indefinite QuantityPeriod of Performance:  One year with 2 additional option yearsSubmittal Information:Respondents shall provide in a general capabilities statement to address the following information: 1.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for GPS Corner Collection in California.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.
This task will consist of three major components:  1) Field collection of GPS observations on 584 PLSS corners, 2) Incorporation of this more accurate control data via GMM into individual target township data sets.  3)  Regional adjustment (GMM), Attribution Quality Assurance (FIXAN), and topology Quality Assurance (FIXLX) workload, to produce regionally adjusted, seamless CADNSDI compliant GIS coverages for ARRA townships and similarly updated GMM source files.  The goal is to reasonably depict these areas in GCDB.
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with NORTH RIVER BOATS INC, 1750 GREEN SIDING RD, ROSEBURG, OR 97470-7121 to provide an engine repower for a Almar 30' Sounder vessel for Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Gustavus, AK 99828. North River Boats Inc is the original provider of the vessel and is uniquely able to provide the technical experience and equipment for this repower project. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background:  In late FY09 the TALUS (1997 ALMAR 30' Sounder) suffered a catastrophic engine failure. The engine is not economically repairable. The TALUS was designed by the Park Service and constructed to their specifications by North River Boats Inc, a distributor of Almar Aluminum Boats..  It is much heavier than most aluminum vessels its size and has never performed at the level desired by the Park Service. Replacing the single engine w/ jet drive with twin engines and Prop drives will make the vessel perform as needed.
1. FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Research done with  North River Boats Inc who constructed the TALUS, Yanmar engine representatives and outdrive representatives indicate that repowering the TAULS as requested will make the vessel perform as desired by the Park Service. North River Boats Inc originally constraucted the TALUS. They have the original drawings, the factory jigs on which it was assembled and some of the staff who originally constructed the vessel. They are the most familiar with the hull construction and what is needed to make the necessary modifications.
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:  Removal of old engine and drive. Modification of the hull to accept twin engines with outdrives. Installation of twin engines and outdrives with all necessary accessories to operate engines.              
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.):  North River Boats Inc constructed the TALUS. They have the Factory Jigs it was built on, the original drawings and some of the personnel on staff who originally constructed the vessel. They are the most familiar with the hull construction and what is needed to make the necessary modifications. The engine installation requested is a field tested and proven installation and is one which they do regularly on vessels constructed for other government agencies. 
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: North River Boats Inc is the only company that carries Almar Aluminum boats and therefore would be the most technically able to perform the required services. 
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  Modifying a vessel hull is a technical undertaking and one which must be done accurately if the vessel is to perform properly. North River Boats Inc has the factory jigs to hold the hull true and has workers who are familiar with the hull. They should be able to do quality work in less time than a vendor not familiar with the hull and lacking the jigs to hold the hull in place during modification.  
6.A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: There are no actions to be taken.

<p>Mr. Howard E. Marks, Jr. has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of an ombudsman does not dimish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals, or the source selection process and therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the POC listed for this solicitation. When requested the Ombudsman, Mr. Howard E. Marks Jr., may be contacted at: 1755 Eleventh St, Bldg 570, Room 101, WPAFB OH 45433-7404, Telephone (937) 255-8642, (DSN) 785-8642, Fax (937) 656-7193 or e-mail: howard.marks@wpafb.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), intends to award under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold $100,000), a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to the California Rural Indian Health Board, 4400 Auburn Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95841 for the following services, under NAICS Code 923120. The purpose of this effort is to conduct a Data Symposium to examine at least four reports of studies identifying barriers and problems of consistent data tracking of American Indian/Alaska native enrollment and utilization of Medicare and Medicaid programs. A group of subject matter experts are required to analyze the findings in the reports and recommend solutions to improving data collection. The symposium will include invited participants from CMS, IHS, the TTAG (Tribal Technical Advisory Group), academia, the National Indian Health Board, the national Congress of American Indians, Congressional staff, the Kaiser Foundation, and Families USA. The day and a half event will include presentations by a TTAG representative discussing previous data research projects; experienced academic researchers; at least one CMS Data analyst; and one HIS Data Analyst. The last half of the symposium will be reserved for the identification of secondary analysis that would further the understanding of health status, service utilization and barriers to care for the three target populations identified in the TTAG research framework. The contractor will summarize the existing reports, secure subject matter experts, coordinate the development of a whitepaper, and coordinate recommendations for future actions. The contractor will also provide meeting support and services including planning and coordination of all meeting logistics and material preparation for the CMS/TTAG Data Symposium. This event will be by invitation only and requires that all participants review the three baseline documents, and come prepared to contribute to the ideas and discussion generated by panel discussants designated in advance for topic areas in each report. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be six months following the award of a purchase order. This procurement should be awarded to the CRIHB because this organization has a current Data Use Agreement with CMS and has been analyzing the HIS and CMS data and published three of the documents cited. Other organizations will have to go through the process of requesting and obtaining data use agreements with both CMS and IHS. CRHIB is very familiar with the importance of having data that is consistent between federal agencies and is very familiar with working with AIAN populations and organizations. A detail Statement of Work is attached. All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if received timely, must be considered by the agency. Expression of interest and statement of capabilities must be emailed to Phillip.Harrell@cms.hhs.gov. Statement of capabilities must be received within 5 days from the published date of this notice. In addition, all interested contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) at the following website: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>Please refer to instructions in the attached packet for more detailed requirements to submit a proper reponse to this RFP.<br /><br />Project: Production of a Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody IgG1&kappa; in a Hollow Fiber Bioreactor
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A monoclonal antibody has been developed as an immunotherapy treatment of primary amyloidosis in humans. This antibody is directed against the fibrillar deposits formed from the disease in vital tissues as the disease progresses. This antibody is a chimeric IgG1&kappa;. The requirement for the antibody is development and production to support toxicology studies and Phase I clinical trials. The specified production technology for clinical grade material would be at a GMP biopharmaceutical production facility that can produce this antibody in a hollow fiber bioreactor.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT SUMMARY</p>
<p>An adherent dhfr- CHO cell line from a MCB supplied by the BDP will be scaled up in cell culture vessels to obtain enough cells to inoculate 1 or more cultureware sets for a hollow fiber bioreactor. More then 1 bioreactor may be needed to produce a required 140 grams of bulk bioreactor harvest. The crude harvest will be packaged in bottles and frozen for storage until delivered to the BDP. An End of Production cell bank will be required.<br />3. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>A. Project Management Plan</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will be required to submit a Project Management Plan (PMP) describing the means of accomplishing the project tasks. The PMP will include the approach that will be taken to meet the project deliverables and timelines. <br /><br />B. Risk Management Plan</p>
<p>The PMP will include a risk management plan (RMP) to identify potential technical problems that might arise during the course of work. The Subcontractor shall suggest solutions or alternative back up plans to address these potential problems.</p>
<p>C. Reports and Meetings</p>
<p>1. Project meetings will occur bi-weekly or as required by the BDP Project Scientist<br />2. Monthly technical and financial status reports <br />3. Reports will include assay profiles, technology transfer report, certificates of analysis and a manufacturing report.</p>
<p>D. Production Tasks</p>
<p>A technology transfer package and vials of the MCB will be supplied to the Subcontractor. An Assay Profile of acceptance criteria for the harvest and End of Production bank will be supplied.</p>
<p>1. The cells are scaled up in cell factories or roller bottles until ample cells are obtained to inoculate a hollow fiber bioreactor. The cells have a doubling time of between 50 and 66 hours using CHO-S-SFM II serum free medium (contains glutamine, Invitrogen catalog number 31033), 10% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum and 1&micro;M methotrexate. The peak cell density range at 3 days is 8 X104 to 1 X105 per cm2 and the viability remains in the mid 90% range.</p>
<p>2. The bioreactor is run for 60 calendar days. Approximately ten 850cm2 roller bottles are required to inoculate a single 2.1m2 hollow fiber cartridge at 1X109 cells. A bioreactor feasibility run performed at the BDP at this scale produced 11 grams of unprocessed crude antibody in 10 liters. The bioreactor ran for 53 days.<br />The medium for the bioreactor is:<br /><br />Intracapillary Side - Modified DMEM/F12 without phenol red, HEPES, Glutamine, 4.5grams glucose/liter <br />L-Glutamine, 4mM final <br />Methotrexate, 1&micro;M final</p>
<p>Extracapillary Side - CHO-S-SFM II (Invitrogen catalog number 31033)<br />10% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum Day 0 to day 23 <br />5% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum Day 24 to day 60</p>
<p>3. Harvest is collected at +20C to +80C in volumes up to 2 liters or no longer then every 4 days and frozen in aliquots at &le; -70C.</p>
<p>4. A 60 vial End of Production Cell Bank will be required from the longest run (if more then one bioreactor run is needed). Each vial will contain at least 4 X 106 cells.</p>
<p>5. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance is 10 months beginning upon the award of the subcontract.</p>
<p>6. OTHER REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1. Facility audit for technical capability and cGMP compliance</p>
<p>2. Execution of a Quality Agreement. A template of the agreement is available at http://wwwbdp.ncifcrf.gov/ (Biopharmaceutical Quality Assurance &rarr; Quality Agreement Template). This agreement is negotiable.</p>

The weed inspection will designate a pit in one of three rating categories:  acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable.  Sand and gravel from a pit designated as unacceptable can be used if the material is heat treated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and promptly transported from the quarry to the park or a pre-approved weed free storage area to prevent possible weed contamination.
A list of weeds of concern can be obtained from Devils Tower National Monument.
The control of noxious weeds shall be achieved as follows:All vehicles and equipment to be used in Devils Tower National Monument shall be thoroughly pressure washed prior to arrival.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

	Implementation of a proof of concept, through which a previously untested innovation is tested on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified problem (OR: to determine whether it works to solve/address an identified problem);

	Implementation of an innovation or improvement approach*, to provide information for decision-makers about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation will actually work in a given setting;

	Spread, or the taking to scale, of one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements, including the active, wide dissemination of information about what works, accompanied by concrete guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability.  Increasing knowledge about strategies used to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is an important ACTION objective as well. 

	Sustainability, to increase knowledge about the factors that contribute to, or impede, the long term sustainability of innovation.  In particular, we will look to ACTION II to closely examine the experiences and outcomes of ACTION projects that were implemented 3 or more years ago, with a focus on measuring whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained and enhancing understanding of the factors that supported or impeded sustainability.


B.2	TASK ORDERS

	This is a task order requirement for Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II). Services will be acquired on an as-needed basis through issuance of task orders. The minimum total amount to be awarded over the three year base period is plus two (2) year Option Period will be $3,750,000.00. It is anticipated that the maximum total amount for the Base period will be $4,500,000.00 and 3,000,000.00 for the Option Periods. Typical task orders are expected to range between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00

SECTION C- DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

Background

AHRQs mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  Agency funding is growing for research that advances the implementation and dissemination of promising or proven innovations that address the most pressing concerns of those who deliver, manage, pay for, or receive health care services.  AHRQs role in supporting efforts to improve real-world practice and policy has expanded rapidly, in part as a result of the recent emergence of health care reform as one of the most pressing challenges the nation faces.

In 2004, Greenhalgh et al.  completed an extensive review of literature addressing the question how can we spread and sustain innovations in health service delivery and organization? These authors identified several knowledge gaps on which to focus further research, and suggested that the most serious gap must be addressed by answering the question: By what processes are particular innovations implemented and sustained (or not) in particular contexts and settings, and can these processes be enhanced? In 2006, AHRQ launched an initiative titled Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION) that attempted to address many aspects of the gap identified by Greenhalgh et al., and that is the precursor of the current procurement, ACTION II.

ACTION is a five-year task order contract model of practice-based implementation research that includes 15 Partnerships that work under task order contracts.  The Partnerships include a total of over 140 additional collaborating organizations. In total, ACTION Partnerships provide care to more than 100 million people nationwide that represent a broad geographic, demographic and payer mix.  The 15 Partnerships reach across all states and are composed of diverse organizations involved in health care, including: hospital systems; ambulatory care practices; long-term care systems (nursing homes, home health, assisted living); safety net systems; health plans; university schools of medicine, nursing, public health, health policy, and management; health services and outcomes research organizations; Veterans Integrated Delivery System Networks; health care quality assurance organizations, associations of healthcare providers; and consumer advocacy organizations.  Each Partnership contains operational systems that house large, robust, healthcare databases, clinical and research expertise, and the authority to implement health care innovations. A particular focus of ACTION task orders has been on increasing understanding not only of whether a particular innovation works, but on how and why it does or does not work. ACTION represents one of the Agencys most successful efforts to foster public-private collaboration and incorporate best practices into health care delivery, broadly defined (see Definitions below). The period of performance for the current ACTION initiative ends September 30, 2010. For more information about ACTION, including descriptions and funding levels for task orders funded to date, go to www.ahrq.gov/research/ACTION.htm.  

Since ACTION was launched in 2006, calls for additional practice-based research endeavors have increased, and the value of this type of research has been more widely recognized (Shortell et. al, JAMA 2007, Berwick JAMA 2008, Wachter ). Berwick highlighted the need for research methodologies that focus on the local details about how something works and about the what of contexts, rather than removing these details in theoretical pursuit of generalizable knowledge. Berwick noted that it is only by retaining and sharing information about both the mechanisms  and contexts (local conditions that could have influenced the outcomes of interest), that one develops an understanding of the factors that affect generalizability.   Shortell and his colleagues similarly identified the need for increased knowledge about how to put known improvements into routine practice as a key component for improving the quality of care.  Shortell et. al. noted that this integration of content and context seldom happens, and specifically called for the expansion of practice-based research networks such as AHRQs ACTION.   Furthermore, Harvards Steven Spear offered the following guidance and insights from his study of Toyota:  When experimenting with innovations, do not merely ask "what did we accomplish?'" but "what did we learn and how can we put that learning to good use?   Spear has noted that
 
(i)f you manage your work to achieve constant discoverydoing your work with a close eye toward what you don't understand, seeing problems as they occur, solving those problems, converting what you don't understand into something that you do understand, and then putting to use what you now understand and what others don't understandyou could improve and invent more quickly, for longer, and in more areas than anyone else. The key is not importing the answer: it's in importing the robust process by which the great answers are discovered.  
 
Particular interest in research on delivery of care improvement (e.g. process redesign, organizational changes, or financial incentives) has increased since efforts to launch health care reform began in earnest in early 2009.  Nearly one quarter of the priority topics specified by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research (http://www.iom.edu/?ID=71025) as meriting more attention are classified in the IOMs broad health care delivery system (HCDS) research area.  This type of research is, of course, particularly well-suited to the interests and capabilities of past and future ACTION researchers.

The current procurement for ACTION II seeks to answer these calls. ACTION II is open to all offerors and will establish an entirely new set of task order contracts. For ACTION II, AHRQ anticipates making awards to between 12 and 15 ACTION II Partnerships that are expected to have many similar characteristics to ACTION Partnerships.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, similarities in task order characteristics are likely to apply as well. There is a high probability of steady or increasing funding for task orders from AHRQ portfolios. In addition, funding may be provided from external sponsors.  Organizations that have funded past task orders include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the DHHS Office of Minority Health/Office of the Secretary, the National Cancer Institute, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  For ACTION II, AHRQ is taking steps to better meet the needs of users, stakeholders and Agency and DHHS goals,  to improve work flow and productivity and to support enhanced communication and collaboration within and among the Partnerships.

Definitions and Frequently Asked Questions

For the purposes of this RFP, the following definitions, some of which have been adapted from Greenhalgh et al., apply: 

Innovation in health care delivery, organization, payment and practice (referred to hereafter as health care delivery): a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness, access to care or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Innovations can either be new to the field of health care delivery or new to a given organization or particular type of setting.

Implementation: active and planned efforts to mainstream an innovation within an organization

Dissemination: active and planned efforts to persuade target groups to adopt an innovation

Sustainability: making an innovation routine until it reaches obsolescence

AHRQ priority populations: children, the elderly, women, individuals affected by low income, who belong to racial/ethnic minorities, who live in rural areas, who are disabled or have special needs

AHRQ target audiences: clinical, health care provider, purchaser/business, policy, and consumer/patient decision-makers

Appendix 1 includes a series of frequently asked questions, based on prior RFPs for implementation research.
 
Objectives

The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery to measurably improve the effectiveness, safety, quality and efficiency of health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will support practice-based research focused on achieving one or more of the following four objectives:
 
	Test or expand investigation of innovations that are new to the health care field, (proofs of concept). Research focused on this objective involves: testing a previously untested innovation on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified health care problem; documenting whether and how well it did or did not work, and why; spreading knowledge generated by this research to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Implement, in additional settings, interventions or improvement approaches that have been demonstrated to have worked in a limited type or number of settings. Research aimed at achieving this objective would generate findings about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation actually works in various settings; and spreading findings to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Spread, or take to scale, one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements.  Activities to achieve this objective would include the active, wide dissemination of one or more innovations that have proven successful in improving health outcomes or on-the-ground care delivery and the provision of guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability of the innovation/s. Identifying and evaluating different strategies for promoting the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is another important component of this objective. Activities to increase spread can take many forms, and can be undertaken by and/or target any key stakeholder groups.   

	Support Sustainability. To achieve this objective, researchers shall: identify and study the factors that contribute to, or impede, the routinization of innovation by appropriate decision-makers and other audiences. In particular, AHRQ will look to ACTION II to closely examine past ACTION (and other) projects to assess whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained, and to learn more about their longer term experiences in trying to sustain their innovations.


ACTION II Characteristics

ACTION II will embody some similar and some new features when compared with ACTION. The principal features of ACTION II include: 

Task Order Master Contract Mechanism: Each ACTION II awardee shall hold a 3-year task order master contract with a 2-year option to extend the contract. Competitive (or justified sole-source) solicitations for task orders will be sent by email to these pre-competed prime contractors throughout each fiscal year.  Each prime contractor shall share these requests for task order (RFTO) with others in its Partnership and decide whether or not to submit one or more task order proposals in response to the RFTO. AHRQ will specify the number of awards anticipated in response to a single RFTO, and the range or ceiling on the cost estimate for each award. Generally, proposals must be submitted within four to eight weeks.  The proposals submitted in response to each RFTO will be reviewed on average within two to three weeks by a committee of approximately five expert reviewers selected among AHRQ staff, co-funders (where applicable), and external experts in the areas critical to the success of the task order. Revisions may be required of one or more top scoring proposals for each anticipated award. Awards will generally be made within two to three weeks of receipt of best and final proposals. 

Topics for Research:  ACTION II is intended to generate and spread knowledge about solutions to current problems in a timely way. ACTION II will thus focus on practical, applied topics of high interest to: the DHHS and AHRQs portfolios (see Appendix 2), the Partners own operational leaders and champions, others making critical decisions and managing change, and other users/stakeholders.  AHRQ intends to use various mechanisms (e.g., Requests for Information, email queries, input from the ACTION II Steering Committee, input from an AHRQ web call for ACTION II concepts) to solicit user input on task order topics and ensure they are feasible, of high priority and ready for implementation or dissemination.  

Broadly speaking, topics will likely include, but will not be limited to: patient safety, health information technology, the structure, organization and coordination of care; payment; quality of care; comparative effectiveness of systems design and change strategies; health care for priority populations; prevention and care management, long-term care, health literacy and emergency preparedness. No health care setting, type of provider, type of recipient, payer or health condition will be excluded from consideration with respect to research topics that may be undertaken under ACTION II, though individual RFTOs are likely to focus on particular types of settings, providers or patients. It is expected that there will be a wide array of topics with substantial diversity within a given topic area. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics that are unknown at the launch of ACTION II may emerge over time. As was noted earlier, task orders will have a particular focus on research designed to increase knowledge about contextual factors that may facilitate or impede implementation, spread and sustainability. 

Nature of the Research: Practice-based research on the development, testing, implementation, spread and sustainability of innovations can take many forms. Some task orders will support the development or preliminary testing (proof-of concept) of package deliverables (e.g., toolkits, curricula, workbooks, guides, models, practice strategies) that address a problem in a new or novel way.  Other task orders may call for the implementation of a proven innovation in sites similar to, and/or different from, those in which it was developed, with the goal of increasing knowledge about the process of implementing innovations and the contextual factors influencing implementation. Still other task orders may focus on the evaluation of different strategies for spreading a proven intervention widely, in order to identify those that are most effective in increasing the systematic and successful adoption and utilization of evidence-based practices. Finally, an additional set of task orders may focus on evaluating whether and to what degree innovations implemented under past ACTION contracts (or other AHRQ initiatives) were sustained, and increasing knowledge about the factors that support or impede sustainability.

Types of Innovations:   As previously defined, innovations are a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Examples of current health care delivery innovations include evidence-based improvement strategies or activities such as Lean, positive deviance, social network analysis, and the implementation of bundled interventions (e.g. Pronovosts Keystone ICU bundle to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections ), bundled payments (e.g. around the Patient Centered Medical Home ) or other innovative financial mechanisms . Future innovations will emerge over the course of the ACTION II period of performance.

ACTION II innovations may be local to national in scope. Some past innovations have spread internationally, although this will not be explicitly envisioned or intended in the development of ACTION II RFTOs. AHRQ will make efforts to select and emphasize project work that is broadly responsive to existing user and stakeholder needs and operational interests, and that has the potential for future dissemination to additional health care settings, providers. payors or recipients of care. While a minority of task orders are expected to focus on large (regional, national) implementation or dissemination projects, Partnerships that have the capacity to take innovations to scale, either on their own or in partnership with others, to spread an innovation will be of special interest to AHRQ. 

Deliverables:  AHRQ and others experience has shown that delivery of a product or package alone to an intended audience is generally insufficient to induce tangible change in care delivery. Those delivering and receiving care often need help in using a new product or approach, particularly if behavior change is required to improve care. ACTION II will thus seek to generate deliverables that maximize the likelihood that research findings and best practices can and will be appropriately utilized by the intended audience/s. Final deliverables may include, but would not be limited to:
	products (e.g. toolkits, workbooks or guides) that provide detailed, practical descriptions of an innovation, explanations of how it is supposed to work and advice for implementing it
	innovative educational or training materials, including curricula for educational/training sessions or workshops (these may be web based)
	provision of support and technical assistance in the adaptation and adoption of a package or process by various new users 
	research findings written for decision-makers
	peer-reviewed and trade journal manuscripts, or final reports suitable for web-posting, summarizing lessons learned

Every deliverable, regardless of its form or content, must be specifically developed for or adapted to the intended audience/s.

Task orders may require the provision of a series of interim deliverables to accelerate delivery of critical findings or better document implementation processes as they unfold. Interim deliverables might include the completion of an environmental scan, the convening of focus groups, technical expert panels or stakeholder meetings, and the development or testing of measures or data bases, interim reports, surveys, or case studies, to name just a few. 

Dissemination: Spreading knowledge generated under task orders is a key component of all four objectives for ACTION II. ACTION II Partnerships may opt to include that capability within their proposed Partnership (by including as members one or more organizations with expertise in dissemination/knowledge transfer), or to subcontract for that expertise on a case-by-case basis, as dictated by the needs or requirements of a specific RFTO. Such expertise should include editing and technical writing, at a minimum.  In addition, AHRQ technical assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing may also be provided (see Appendix 3).   

Rapid Cycle Research: Individual ACTION II task orders must be completed within as short a time frame as feasible. As a frame of reference, ACTION task orders have been completed within 20 months, on average, of the award date. AHRQ expects ACTION II task orders to meet this average timeline of performance.  Exceptions to accelerated task orders may include task orders that require an additional 7-9 months (on average, currently) to meet OMB clearance requirements, and/or task orders that are very large, multifaceted, and require longer periods of data collection.  In AHRQs experience, several factors help accelerate the turn-around time of task orders once awarded.  These factors include, but are not limited to: a focus on topics for which there is a clearly expressed need by a specific intended audience, that are of high current interest to the Partnerships themselves, and for which there is alignment of interest of all parties involved in making the innovation successful; active involvement of champions and operational leaders; and inclusion of individuals in the Partnership who are knowledgeable about, and can readily access and manipulate, needed health care delivery and organizational data.

Sequenced and Bundled Work:  AHRQ may, where appropriate, reduce the current focus on individual task orders and increase the emphasis on a series of task orders or bundled sets of task orders to permit pursuit of topics to their logical and practical ends and take applications to scale. Some of the work to be done under ACTION II will likely be sequenced, with the work of each new phase being dependent on the results of a previous phase. In other cases, a set (bundle) of task orders may be awarded in response to a single RFTO on a topic. It is to be expected that some mix of individual and bundled/serial task orders will be awarded in each year. 

Freedom to Partner with Diverse Organizations or Stakeholder Groups on an As Needed Basis.  Partnerships will be allowed to subcontract with other organizations, as necessary, to meet the needs of a given RFTO.  Partners shall have to decide at the outset which capacities they are likely to need on a continuing basis, and which they may prefer to seek and obtain on a case by case basis to enable them to compete for, and successfully complete, specific task orders throughout the contractual timeline. 

Opportunities for Broad-based Collaboration:  AHRQ expects to encourage more intersections among the ACTION II Partnerships. For example awardees of bundled task orders may wish, or be expected, to share lessons learned with each other as the task orders progress. Depending on the nature of specific task orders, ACTION II Partners many also be encouraged or required to interact with other AHRQ initiatives and programs such as the Health Care Innovations Exchange, the Primary-care Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs), or the HIV Research Network. More information on these and other programs is available at www.ahrq.gov.

Emphasis on Communication and Knowledge Capture: A number of mechanisms will be utilized to support and ensure regular communication between AHRQ and its ACTION II Partners, and among the ACTION II members-- both within and across Partnerships. These will include electronic transmission of progress reports, phone calls, virtual and face-to-face meetings, and the use of a new ACTION II portal. More specifically: 

	ACTION II task order contractors shall communicate with their task order officers on a regular basis (monthly/bimonthly/quarterly) by submitting progress reports and deliverables through AHRQs electronic reporting system. In addition, contractors and task order officers are expected to meet by phone or in person at regular, specified intervals. 

	ACTION II members shall communicate with each other, both within and across Partnerships, through an ACTION II web portal (see Appendix 3) that will be created for this purpose. Tools to support dialogue and collaboration will include web conferencing, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will also serve as an additional avenue for communication between task order officers or ACTION II staff, and contractors. For example, ACTION II staff might use it for teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

	ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository that will be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 

	Representatives of all ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in annual (or perhaps semi annual) face-to-face or virtual meetings. Other meeting participants may include ACTION II Staff, AHRQ Task Order Officers, the AHRQ Contracting Officer, experts in federal requirements, and experts in dissemination. ACTION II members will be expected to help AHRQ staff and ACTION II Steering Committee members shape the agenda for these meetings to assure their relevance to participants needs. Meeting topics may include sharing insights and lessons learned about ACTION II work, new opportunities for collaboration, or strategies developed to meet contractual requirements or overcome common obstacles. 

External Steering Committee: AHRQ expects to convene an External Steering Committee of leading operationally-based experts in healthcare delivery and other stakeholders and champions (including some already involved in advising AHRQ on related topics) to provide direction for ACTION II.  Guidance from the Steering Committee on how best to achieve program goals is intended to supplement that provided by AHRQ Center and Office Directors, portfolio leads and Task Order Officers, and will focus on identifying the most promising opportunities for the program and providing continuous input on strategic planning. The Steering Committee will also serve as an effector arm to help disseminate and promote uptake of ACTION II innovations.
 

Meeting Federal Requirements:  Task order contract research conducted under federal auspices, and products and deliverables generated by such research, must meet a number of requirements, including those associated with compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. As is further discussed below and in Appendix 3, AHRQ will help ACTION II Partners access technical assistance and other resources to support these efforts.

Support and Technical Assistance for ACTION II Partnerships: AHRQ seeks to help contractors more quickly and efficiently meet specific federal requirements for ACTION II task orders and deliverables (e.g. obtain OMB clearance, meet Section 508 compliance and other web-based product requirements) and enhance dissemination, communication and marketing efforts (see Appendix 3). To this end, AHRQ has arranged to provide support and technical assistance in the above-specified areas to Partnerships, as needed, on a case by case basis for awarded task orders. It is anticipated that some Partnerships already may have some or all required expertise within the project team they propose in response to an RFTO and may not require additional support or technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. Whether the expertise is subcontracted through AHRQ-organized experts or supplied by the team itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs. 

Eligibility Criteria

AHRQ encourages submission of proposals from Partnerships that will represent, in total, expertise that spans a broad array of organizations involved in health care delivery and recipients of care (including AHRQs priority populations). These include, but are not limited to health services research organizations; health care delivery systems and organizations (inpatient, ambulatory and long-term care); health plans; academic health centers, research consulting firms; Quality Improvement Organizations; Veterans Administration sites and other governmental organizations; employers or employer coalitions; state and local government health care agencies; community-based collaboratives to improve health care, consumer advocacy groups, and other organizations that work at the national, state or regional level to promote or leverage evidence-based innovation in health care delivery.  Given trends in recent funding and priority topics, AHRQ is particularly interested in Partnerships that center on, or include, substantial numbers of primary care providers interested in participating in ACTION II implementation research. It is important to note that the range of settings/providers included in any specific partnership will not be a scoring criteria; AHRQ hopes to achieve overall diversity across the network of partnerships selected for awards.   

There are no restrictions or requirements regarding the number or types of organizations that should be included in a Partnership, and there are many different models that Partnerships may consider in configuring themselves, including but not limited to the following examples:
	A Partnership may wish to focus on a particular type of provider/care setting/access organization. An example might be a Partnership of primary care practice-based research networks (PBRNS). Other examples might includes hospital systems, long-term care facilities, safety net delivery systems, or health plans that the Partnership would enlist to represent a diverse group of that type of organization; 
	A Partnership may wish to enlist participation from a broad group of stakeholders who span the full range of settings within which care is delivered to a specific priority population (e.g., children, the elderly, the underserved);
	A Partnership may wish to focus on achieving change through a particular type of innovation (e.g., payment) and enlist the participation of interested providers, health plans, and public and private payers 
	A Partnership may be a multi-stakeholder collaborative, composed of plans, providers, payer and consumers from a given geographic region
	A Partnership may be composed of safety net providers who serve multiple priority populations 

The Partnerships proposal must describe how specific characteristics of each participating member organization shall contribute to meeting ACTION IIs objectives.
 
NOTE: The lead, or prime, offeror in a Partnership submitting a proposal may be a not-for-profit or for-profit organization. While primes cannot be included in any other submission, non-prime collaborators may be included in more than one Partnership.  

ACTION II Performance Requirements

To successfully complete task orders that achieve the goals and objectives of the ACTION II program, ACTION II Partnerships must meet the following requirements: 

Requirement #1:  Understand and conform to the requirements of the Task Order Master Contract Mechanism. ACTION II Partnerships must be familiar with federal task order contract mechanisms and must be prepared to adhere to the requirements of the master contract signed by the lead Partner. While this point seems obvious, past experience has shown some misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of the signed task order contract by the lead contractor organization or the subcontractors on a given task order.  Task order contracts differ substantially from grants. For example: task orders must conform strictly to the scope of work for which the task order is awarded unless a modification is agreed to in advance by appropriate AHRQ staff; deliverables must be submitted on time and their quality must be approved by AHRQ staff;  deliverables must be approved by AHRQ staff prior to publication or presentation; invoices for hours worked during the invoice period must be submitted regularly and must include all required details; payment is conditional on submission of invoices and task order officer approval of the quality of the work performed; work conducted past the end date of the task order period of performance will not be reimbursed; and OMB clearance is required for collection of certain types and amounts of data. Partnerships that can demonstrate a track record of successful task order contract work, and/or have a clear understanding of, and willingness to conform to, contractual requirements will be preferred.  

Requirement # 2:  Understand and be committed to the benefits and purposes of practice-based implementation research generally, and of ACTION goals and objectives more specifically. ACTION II Partnerships must have a keen awareness of where their research might, and should, be applied in practice.  As has already been noted, but bears repeating, AHRQ is particularly interested in process: how implementation and dissemination of innovations works (or why it does not work). In cases where real-time learning is occurring, it will be important to capture sufficient information on the process itself to allow other health care delivery systems, organizations, and practitioners to adapt (or avoid) the innovation for their own use.  There must be sufficient scrutiny and documentation of processes to assure that others can gain from the experience of the task order team.

In preparing proposals in response to RFTOs, Partners should address questions such as:  
a.	Who are the end users who will apply the innovation in practice?
b.	What barriers or obstacles need to be addressed and overcome? What facilitators can be engaged? 
c.	Which implementation partners can help involve the most appropriate users? 
d.	Which dissemination partners can help reach additional appropriate users? 
e.	How can the research outcomes best be communicated to the intended audiences? 
f.	What is the best way to evaluate how the innovation works and if it will be sustainable? 

Requirement #3: Enlist the committed, continuing participation of organizations whose missions and capacities enable them to successfully complete task orders serving one or more of the four ACTION objectives for practice-based research (see Objectives).

AHRQ seeks involvement of: diverse providers and provider and system sites; providers of all levels of care that serve underserved populations; public and private payers interested in working with providers to achieve large scale and sustained innovation; organizations representing consumers/recipients of care; organizations with large data bases; researchers with clinical, organizational, measurement and other interests and expertise in health care delivery. Since the goal of ACTION II is to accelerate the development, implementation and sustainability of evidence-based innovations to improve health delivery, AHRQ has an obvious interest in including providers who have a track record of being innovators, early adopters, change agents or otherwise at the cutting edge of developing or implementing innovation. However, AHRQ believes that it is equally important that ACTION II include organizations that are broadly representative of the full spectrum of providers in terms of their past experience with implementing innovation or their capacity to do so.

Requirement #4:  Perform high quality, practice-based implementation research. Partnerships will be expected to demonstrate research capacity and experience with all facets of practice-based implementation research, as described above.  Such research shall of necessity center on a broad range of health care settings, providers, recipients of care, payers, and possibly on particular health conditions and will be expected to span diverse demographic, payer and geographic mixes. Multi-method research will often, if not always, be required. This will in turn require collaborations among well-recognized researchers, clinicians and others with expertise and experience in the full range of implementation research methods ( including both qualitative and quantitative methods); in manipulating large, robust databases (particularly electronic databases); in evidence-based management; and in a wide range of substantive clinical and organizational/management issue areas.  Finally, an ability to properly perform the desired research will require access to data bases whose size, scope and specificity are well-aligned with the research questions they are expected to help answer.

Requirement #5: Be prepared to enlist the participation of additional organizations in response to emergent needs and opportunities. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics and opportunities may emerge over time. Thus, Partnerships must be able to flexibly respond to new and unanticipated topics and opportunities. This flexibility is likely to result from a combination of the existing capacities of the Partnership and its member organizations, as well as from an ability to nimbly expand and change over time to accommodate new challenges and opportunities as they arise. As was noted earlier, AHRQ also expects to encourage more intersections with other initiatives and programs within or external to AHRQ.

Requirement #6: Perform research that supports AHRQs research priorities as reflected in its portfolios. Generally, funding for ACTION II task orders will come from one or more of AHRQs portfolios. The subjects of these task orders will thus reflect the research interests and objectives of the portfolios (see Appendix 2). The composition and capacities of ACTION II Partnerships should be shaped by a desire to serve these interests and objectives. 

Requirement #7:  Target priority populations. AHRQ seeks to include ACTION II Partnerships that serve large numbers of one or more priority populations (see Definitions). Because of the importance of this requirement, offerors are required to complete a matrix that provides information on the characteristics of the Partnerships recipients of care (Appendix 4.

Requirement #8: Engage and involve operational and quality improvement leaders.  AHRQ will expect to see evidence of strong commitment from operational and quality improvement leaders and champions of innovation, learning and change within ACTION IIs Partnerships.  Champions and leaders are expected to actively support healthcare delivery and organization improvement (e.g., making efforts to encourage the adoption of best practices, where promising, within and beyond their organizations). 

Requirement #9: Understand and meet the needs of AHRQ target audiences. Understanding and serving the needs of AHRQs multiple target audiences (see Definitions) is a central requirement of ACTION II. While no single Partnership is expected to represent or include every one of these audiences, AHRQ intends to ensure that all of these audiences will be well represented within the ACTION II network. Offerors will thus be asked to provide information on the basic characteristics of their Partnerships participants and any additional audiences the Partnership is in a position to reach and influence (Appendices 4 and 5). 

Requirement #10:  Identify and utilize communications and dissemination vehicles, methods and mechanisms that will maximize the likelihood of broad and meaningful translation of research into practice.  Dissemination of findings or products will be a key requirement of every ACTION II RFTO. Partnerships will have the option of demonstrating expertise and experience within their teams of what is variously referred to as knowledge transfer and exchange, knowledge communication, knowledge translation. Alternatively, Partnerships may wish to subcontract out the dissemination/knowledge translation functions on a case by case basis for individual task orders.  For some task order deliverables considered to be particularly important, additional assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing will be provided by AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (see Appendix 3).   

Requirement #11:  Manage complex research projects and coordinate widely varying activities across multiple, diverse sites and actors. Each Partnership will be required to designate a point person or small team located within the lead Partner organization to assume responsibility for: meeting ACTION II contract requirements (including the federal requirements described above); coordinating tasks and activities within the Partnership; assuring ongoing engagement of operational and quality improvement leadership; assuring quality control of task order deliverables; and maintaining effective communication with AHRQ staff throughout the period of performance of the ACTION II master contract. This point of contact or team will be expected to develop and maintain a solid working relationship with AHRQ staff affiliated with ACTION II (Task Order Officers, Contracting Officer, Program Officer, Support and Technical Assistance staff, if needed) and shall be responsible for maintaining current information on Partnership activities, participants and task order progress and deliverables on the ACTION II portal. Every technical proposal submitted in response to an RFTO must include information on who shall perform this role and how these needs shall be met; cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours and costs. 

Requirement #12: Comply with federal requirements. As noted above, completion of task orders shall generally require compliance with one or more federal laws or regulations, such as those associated with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. In addition, all deliverables must adhere to AHRQ publishing guidelines. As detailed in Requirement #11, an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization must ensure that all federal requirements are met and coordinate all activities associated with doing so.

Requirement #13:  Work on an accelerated basis. Partnerships must have the organizational expertise, experience and willingness to conduct and complete task orders within as short a time frame as feasible. As was noted above, on average task orders not requiring OMB clearance will have periods of performance of approximately 20 months (range: 18-30 months). 

Requirement #14:  Meet deadlines: ACTION II contractors shall assist AHRQ staff in their monitoring and tracking responsibilities by assuring the timely submission of high-quality deliverables. For each task order, progress reports and other deliverables must be submitted electronically at regular, specified intervals. 

Requirement #15:  Engage in knowledge sharing activities within and across Partnerships. Representatives from ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in an annual face-to-face invitational meeting and periodic phone conferences and webinars. In addition, Partnerships and their members will be expected to be active users of the ACTION web portal described above (see Appendix 3).  For example, the prime Partner will be expected to help supply data for the knowledge repository and to maintain up-to-date contact information and profiles of its member organizations. ACTION Partnerships will be encouraged to avail themselves of portal collaboration tools such as web conferences, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. 

In-Kind resources: A Partnerships commitment to a project increases when that project reflects the organizations own goals for, and investments in, quality improvement. While it is not a requirement, a willingness to commit in kind or other resources, if possible and appropriate for future task orders, is desirable. Most Partnerships will end up volunteering some staff time to ACTION II task orders. Such contributions are difficult to predict and quantify, and may depend on the type of organization involved.  However, AHRQ wants to both acknowledge such contributions and more accurately gauge the level and type of commitment provided by Partnerships. For these reasons, in kind resources should be accounted for by Partnerships in ACTION II proposals for specific future task orders, if and when they arise.

Guidelines/Instructions for Demonstrating Ability to Meet Performance Requirements

(a)  Release and Use  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use  Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 months of the receipt of any proposed publication, presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:

(A) Identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) The confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	The quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

(2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1) (A) and (1) (B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b) (1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1) (C) above:

(A)  	the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1) (C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
 (B) 	The Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(3)	If the AHRQ COTR does not provide written conditions or approvals by the end of the six month period following submission of a request to publish a report or to make a presentation or other disclosure of material derived from work performed for AHRQ-funded research, the Contractor may publish, present, or otherwise disclose this material subject to the restrictions of Section 903(c).  However, the Contractor must print prominently on the report or any portion of it which is released, or state prior to any oral or other disclosure of the material derived from work performed under this contract, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

H.10	SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

H.13	AHRQ APPLICATION AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted.

AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC).  This framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the following traditional project phases:

	Concept 
	Initiation
	Planning
	Requirements Analysis
	Design
	Development
	Testing
	Implementation / Deployment
	Operations and Maintenance
	Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  The IBM Rational Suite of tools has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects.   The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology.  The documentation deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by ARHQ.  The Rational ClearCase libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. 

Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractors SDLC must be capable of producing AHRQ required system deliverables containing the required content as described further in the following section.  It is required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain COTR approval before moving from one phase to another. The contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management (CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control process that requires  and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation. 

The following table describes the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

System Documentation 
The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project.  The documentation is to be delivered to the COTR for review and approval for each release.  This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agencys Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM Manager.  All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined artifacts for each production release of the system.  Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as guidance.  The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, Documentation Deliverables, are required by AHRQ. 
Project Initiation Document 

The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  The PID defines the business case for the project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document approved by the COTR and Stakeholders.  Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.  In the case of external development contracts, the PID is satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the vendor and accepted by AHRQ.  

 
Project Work Plan

The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables. This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design, System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which require COTR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.  

System Requirements Document

The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for design and development of the system.  The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:

	Requirement ID, Name and Title
	Requirement Description
	Software Release Version
	Use Case Model
	Use Case Specifications
	Supplementary Specifications

A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary Specifications.
Requirements Traceability Matrix

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them.  This matrix is created at the beginning of a projects lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing.  The project elements are traced as they relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements.  

The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the implementation.  

The following values are required for the traceability matrix:

	Requirement ID and Title;
	The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented;
	The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced;
	The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented;
	The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested; 
	The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.

The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a projects life cycle.

 

System Design Document
The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system.  

The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages.  For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into classes and class utilities.  Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should accompany the introduction.  Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document.

The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational CM Libraries. 

Test Plan
The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system.  The Test Plan is a high level description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following:
A.	Test Description 
	A general overview of the plan for testing the entire system. 
	Test objectives for all testing levels (e.g. module, unit). 
	Scope and guiding principles for the testing effort. 
	A policy for resolving conflicts that arise during the testing process. 
B.	Acceptance Criteria 
	The criteria agreed upon with the customer for acceptance of the software. 
C.	Approach 
	How each major group of software features will be adequately tested.
	Major testing activities, techniques, and testing tools.

User Acceptance Test Report
The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report should include a summary of the testing environment (hardware, software, tools, participant list, etc.) and procedures used to demonstrate and obtain stakeholder approval of the application or system prior to production deployment. The UAT Report should contain a mapping to the SRD and SDD items included in the release as well as an exception list or identified change requests that were generated as the result of testing. 

User Guide
The User Guide is completed prior to production.  The User Guide is a How To manual which navigates the user in detail through the use of the application.  This document usually contains system screen shots and provides step by step instructions for completing tasks and activities.  It is written on a business level with the needs of the user in mind.  At a minimum the document should contain the following content.
	Introduction
	Summary of the application
	Glossary (Definitions/Acronyms)
	Procedures (Step-by Step instructions on how to use the system)

	Recovery Instructions - Describe the steps required to reconstruct the release from the product baselines, established in the configuration management library.

Web Product and Web Site Development Guidelines 
 
The following list highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web tools or sites under contract that will be publicly available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources.  

Guidelines for Web-Based Products
 
Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products publicly available. All products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site should meet the following minimum requirements:
 



Titles of Products

Coordinate with your COTR on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than 10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word counteliminate initial articles such as The or A ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products.

Quality Control/Editorial Review

This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style.  This should be done by the AHRQ grantee or contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual which is available electronically at: 
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility

As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users.
 
Intellectual Property Rights

Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation of the following four questions:

	Who retains the copyright?
	Who has licenses for what purposes and uses?
	What are the constraints imposed?
	Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

Usability 

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are designed to facilitate. A set of Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines that should be consulted are available at: http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html

Beta testing prior to release is desirable, evaluating the product against usability heuristics. As feedback is received and products are updated, the revisions will need to be designated by version number and date of release.
 
Privacy Act Protections

Web resources are subject to the Privacy Act and this can impact both the development of Web-based tools and the users of those tools. Persistent cookies should not be programmed into the functionality of a Web-based tool, although session cookies are allowed. Registration for use cannot be requested if this would involve collection of individual identifiers from the users. Although exemptions to both rules can be sought, this involves a strong justification and several levels of review for approval through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
 
Guidelines for Web Sites
 
Web sites being supported through contracts are considered Federal information resources and as such are required to be in compliance with laws, policies, and directives that affect such resources. 

This includes content management and information categorization, including standard metadata, under the E-Gov Act requirements and Office of Management and Budget issuances to Federal agencies on IT resources. 

For recommendations and guidance on requirements and best practices, go to:  http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/best_practices.shtml

Clearance 

Web resources require clearance by HHS--including justification against a set of criteria. Publications cleared for printing are cleared for Web uploading at the same time. Web resources must comply with the numerous laws and directives that affect federally funded electronic information resources. Web content loaded on a site by contractors must be appropriate and follow all laws and directives. AHRQ Offices and Centers must coordinate initial review through AHRQ's Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) before launch, and OCKT will coordinate departmental clearance. 

Domain Names 

All domain names for any Web resource funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must be registered as .gov through HHS with the General Services Administration (GSA). Although other domains, such as .org, .net, .edu, .com may also be reserved by the Agency, the .gov domain must be registered and that domain name will need to be indexed by FirstGov, the GSA portal to government-funded resources. The FirstGov link is then required on the home page of the site. Coordinate with OCKT on domain name requests. 

Editorial Review

All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain." Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility 

Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services. Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such at HTML versions, but avoid uploading PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. OCKT has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at: http://www.section508.gov

Privacy

A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected.  Sites are periodically audited to ensure that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review--including the Office of General Counsel--and be published in the Federal Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong justification and review process. 

Web Site Mailbox

Every Web site must provide full contact information for the sponsor and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries. 

Records Management

All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to:
http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html

Information Collection Budget

If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection.  

 
Intellectual Property

Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue. 

Linking

External links constitute an implied endorsement and create a business advantage for the linked sites. OMB requires Agencies to do a risk assessment of external links, and potential links need to be assessed against the HHS and AHRQ linking policies and criteria. If a site deviates from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the Web site for full disclosure. Outside Web resources may link to Agency resources providing that the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency of a specific commercial product or service. 

Electronic FOIA

The Agency is required by law to have an electronic FOIA reading room and to provide materials that can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act in electronic form, if so requested. HHS requires that any Web resource funded by the Agency provide a link to the AHRQ Freedom of Information Act page on the main AHRQ Web site. 

Usability

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are supposed to facilitate. Go to http://www.usability.gov as a reference for best practices in initial development or redesign of Web resources. 

Web Sponsor Identity

AHRQ has uniform principles to identify AHRQ as the primary sponsor of AHRQ-related Web sites. These principles reflect HHS best practices for a consistent look and feel of Web resources, reinforce credibility, and support HHS and Agency branding efforts. The four specific principles that should be consistent across all AHRQ-funded Web sites are:
 
	Web site URL name: The name of a Web site should always contain AHRQ in the URL. A Web resource should either be a folder on the main AHRQ Web site (www.ahrq.gov/chiri) or a third-level domain of the Web site (www.webmm.ahrq.gov).
	Title of Web site project: AHRQ's name should be part of the formal title and appear at the beginning of the Web site's project name when referenced in print or promotional materials. For example: AHRQ's Web Morbidity and Mortality online journal.
	HHS and AHRQ logos: The HHS and AHRQ logos should be featured prominently on the Web site and in materials that are used to market that Web site. 
	Web site home page format: The Web site home page should have common design and navigation elements with the HHS Portal and the AHRQ Web site so that all Web sites look as though they belong to the Department and AHRQ Web family. All AHRQ domain sites must include a standard banner and footer that are branded for Web resources. Technical specifications and templates for developers to consult when designing Web resources are provided by the AHRQ Web Manager.

H. 14	TASK ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES

All work required under this contract will be authorized through the issuance of task orders (TOs) signed by the Contracting Officer and accepted by the Contractor.  TOs may be issued at any time within the contract period.    

TOs may often vary in terms of content, cost and duration.  Task orders will normally be cost-reimbursement type contracts.  Task Orders may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable, responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

Each Contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of one task order during the 3-year base contract. The minimum dollar amount guaranteed per Contractor is $25,000.  The purpose of this task order is to provide for general management and administrative work that is not directly attributable to a particular task order topic.  Services requested under this task order will be obtained on an as-needed basis through issuance of specific work assignments, as directed by the Task Order Officer (TOO).

1)	Travel to AHRQ or other locations for meetings concerning ACTION II as directed by the TOO. These funds are not to be used for meetings relating to a specific task order, but rather for the purpose of the overall initiative.
2)	Miscellaneous work associated with the general management and administration of this task order and other assignments as determined by the TOO.
It is expected that TOs will average between $250,000 and $750,000 and last between eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) months with an average being twelve months.  There may be circumstances where the amount and duration of task orders exceed these average amounts.  

Task Order Officer (TOO) will be designated for each TO issued under this contract.  The TOO will function as principle technical liaison between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor's Project Manager.

	Procedures for Issuance of TOs

	1.	Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each TO.  Factors such as past performance, quality of deliverables, cost control, price, cost, or other factors that the Contracting Officer believes are relevant to the placement of orders will be considered.

	2.	When a TO is to be awarded, the Government will solicit proposals from awardees based on those factors mentioned above.  The TO Statement of Work will be sent to those selected awardees and a cost proposal and a brief discussion of technical approach shall be submitted within twenty (20) calendar days.  In unusual circumstances, contractors may be requested to reply within a shorter amount of time.  Oral proposals and streamlined procedures may be used in selecting the TO awardee.

	3.	The determination of award of the TO will be based on cost, technical merit, and any other relevant factors.

4.	Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the Contracting Officer determines that:

		A.	The Agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

		B.	Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

		C.	The order should be issued on a sole-source in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order;

		D.	It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

		E.	When the dollar value of the order is less than $2500.

	5.	Each TO proposal will be subject to review and negotiation and will not be effective until signed by both parties.

		Required content of TO proposals will usually include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

		--offeror's understanding of TO objectives;

--proposed approach to solving the problem in terms of major steps or subtasks of the proposed study program;

		--types of final products anticipated;

--proposed staff by name and percentage of time each individual will be assigned to the work; and

		--management plan for conducting the TO.

	6.	The cost and fee for each TO will be negotiated based on the fixed maximum labor rates set forth in Section B - Supplies or Services and on other cost/fee issues.  

	7.	Upon negotiation and agreement on the proposal submitted, the Contracting Officer shall issue for the signature of the Contractor a formal TO.  The Contractor shall not proceed with performance until the Contracting Officer has signed the TO and provided written approval to proceed.

8.	The Contractor's performance of the TO is subject to the terms and conditions in the contract, and the TO may be modified by the Contracting Officer and ONLY the Contracting Officer.

	9.	Protests ARE NOT authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a TO except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.

	10.	The Contractor is not required to compete for a particular TO if it chooses not to do so, i.e., the Contractor may elect not to submit a proposal on a particular TO.  Such election will not preclude the Contractor from an opportunity to submit proposals on future TOs.

11.	Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily electronically through e-mail or internet but they can also be issued by facsimile or mail.  Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities.  When a RFTO is issued, the Contractor shall provide a proposal containing both technical and cost/price information for performing the required services.  Some RFTOs will contain quick turn-around due dates.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision) 

K.4. PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES
				(FEB 1999) (FAR 52.222-21) 

(a)	 "Segregated facilities," as used in this clause, means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees, that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin because of written or oral policies or employee custom. The term does not include separate or single-user rest rooms or necessary dressing or sleeping areas provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.  The Contractor agrees that a breach of this clause is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract.

(c)	The Contractor shall include this clause in every subcontract and purchase order that is subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this contract.

K.7.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

1)  It has filed all Federal tax returns required during the three years preceding this certification;

2) It has not been convicted of a criminal offense under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and

(1) 	Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) 	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) 	Contract award.
(1) 	The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) 	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) 	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) 	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) 	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) 	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) 	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) 	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) 	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) 	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) 	The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.

(iii) 	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) 	A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) 	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) 	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

	a.	Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that a cost-reimbursement, task order type contract will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

	b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.  To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

		I.	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10). Please mark as original or copy.

(1) Technical Proposal; (2) Past Performance Information; and (3) Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing;
			-to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
			-to respond to Congressional inquiries; and 
	             	-to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

		In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.

Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

	h.	The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.


L.10	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

The technical proposal shall contain an original and twelve (12) hard copies, plus two electronic copies on CD.

	a.	Recommended Technical Proposal Format

The offerors proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.

		3.	Certified documentation that the offeror has a current indirect cost rate agreement in place with a federal agency or that is in the process of obtaining or revising such an agreement.  A copy of the indirect cost rate agreement or the proposed rate agreement shall be provided.


B.	Small Business Subcontracting Plan:  

All offerors except small businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, FAR 52.219-9, incorporated in this solicitation for any task orders that are estimated to be above $550,000.  The plan will only be required when a Request for Task Order Proposal is issued that is estimated to be above $550,000 and does not need to be submitted as part of this proposal.  A copy of a model subcontracting plan is available at http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/read/SampleSubcontractingPlan.doc.  If the model plan is not used, all elements outlined must be addressed in the offerors format.  If the offeror is not a small business and fails to submit a subcontracting plan when requested by a specific RFTO, the offeror will be considered nonresponsive and their proposal will be returned without further consideration. 

This provision does not apply to small business concerns.  This provision does apply to all other offerors, including large business concerns, colleges, universities and non-profit organizations.

		The term subcontract means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract.  This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/ purchase orders for supplies and services such as equipment purchase, copying services, and travel services.

		The offeror understands that:

a.	No Task Order above the threshold will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting Officer. The plan will be incorporated into the Task Order.

b.	An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to participate in the performance of the Task Order.

c.	If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be ineligible for award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed.

d.	Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

e.	It is the offerors responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small business concerns, and that each such aspect of the offerors plan will be judged independent of the other.

f.	The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.  Subcontractors will also submit these reports to the Government Contracting Officer or as otherwise directed, with a copy to the prime Contractors designated small and disadvantaged business liaison.

L.15	PROPOSAL INTENT

It is requested that if an offeror intends to submit a proposal to this solicitation that the attached Proposal Intent Form (Attachment 3) be completed and returned to the address indicated by March 1, 2010.  The submission of the intent form is not binding on an offeror to submit a proposal, nor does the failure to submit the form prohibit an offeror from submitting a proposal.  The purpose is to provide us with an estimated number of proposals to assist us in our planning and logistics for proposal reviews.  We have added a request to include your contact information to a bidders list.  The bidders list will be provided to interested offerors for subcontracting opportunities.  In order for AHRQ to include your contact information on the bidders list, you must return the Proposal Intent Form and check the box that grants permission to add your name no later than the date listed above.
SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  The four factors are: scientific technical merit, cost, past performance.  The scientific technical merit of the proposals will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor(s) for this acquisition.  Offerors that submit technically acceptable proposals will then be evaluated for past performance. Following these evaluations a competitive range will be determined.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all. 


THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION

The Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government.  The evaluation factors and assigned weights which will be used in the overall review of the offerors proposal are outlined below.  The technical proposal shall consist of the responses to evaluation criteria 1 through 3 (including subcriteria). The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The following criteria will be used to evaluate proposals and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  Factors facilitating the evaluation of each criteria below are referenced in the corresponding criteria found in Section L of this solicitation:


OFFERORS PLEASE NOTE: Evaluation Criteria 1 through 3, for  a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by a peer review technical committee that will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal. Program staff and contracting personnel will review and evaluate Criteria 4 for a total of 25 points. The total possible points for Evaluation Criteria 1 though 4 are 125 points.

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  SUBCONTRACT, as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBAs PRONET website.  Please note that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of _30__% for small business (SB), _11_% for small disadvantaged business (SDB), _3__% for HubZone businesses (HUBZone), ___5__% for women-owned business (WOSB), __3__% for veteran-owned business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year _____.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain the following goals, at a minimum, _____% for small business, ____% small disadvantaged business, ____% for HubZone businesses, ______% for   woman owned businesses, and ______% for veteran-owned businesses.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal. 

NOTE TO CONTRACTORS:  Please provide your CCS number with your Dun & Bradstreet number.

9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, HubZone small, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.

In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, HubZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned and women-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.

APPENDIX 1

Frequently Asked Questions

A. Questions on Composition of Partnerships

1) Please define an "offeror"?  Is the entire partnership considered to be an "offeror" or is only one of the partners an offeror and others are subcontractors/collaborators?

From AHRQs perspective, offeror refers primarily to the partnership as a whole. The participants in the partnership consist of the prime, or lead, organization with which AHRQ will contract, and its subcontractors/collaborators.
 
2) Can a subcontractors/collaborator organization participate on two separate proposals from two different offerors?

Yes, an organization can collaborate with more than one prime (i.e., the lead organization) in a partnership. 

3) Would it be permissible for ACTION II to fund partnerships that include organizations based outside the United States?

AHRQ's mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. In order to meet ACTION IIs objectives and to assist in meeting AHRQ's mission, this program is expected to attract and consider offers from US-based healthcare delivery systems that serve US populations and have access to US healthcare system data. 

B. Questions on Process

4) Will ACTION II contract awardees be awarded any funds immediately, or do partnership awardees constitute a "pool" from which AHRQ will develop and solicit proposals for contract task orders at future dates? 

Each prime awardee will receive an initial task order for $25,000 to help defray the cost of travel to occasional ACTION II meetings for partnership representatives, and other miscellaneous administrative tasks. Aside from this initial task order, AHRQ will indeed develop Requests for Task Order at future dates and solicit proposals from ACTION II partnerships. 

5)  Are partnerships to include ideas for task orders in their responses to the ACTION II RFP, or are they simply applying for a contract to become an ACTION contract awardee?  

Ideas for task orders are not requested and should not be included in the proposal.

6) Will the ACTION partnerships participate in the development of future potential tasks and requests for task order?

Yes, submission of 1-2 page concepts for Requests for Task Order is anticipated to be encouraged from all sources:  the ACTION partnerships, AHRQ staff, co-funding organizations, HHS, and others.  The Requests for Task Order themselves are generally developed by AHRQ staff.  Staff from co-funding organizations will also be involved in this process if co-funding is obtained. 

C. Questions on Past Performance

7) If past performance of the organizations involved is in terms of research grants (e.g. NIH RO1 type and foundations), rather than contracts, how will this record be evaluated? Are these organizations at a disadvantage if they do not have past contract experience?

Past performance evaluations on relevant contracts are preferred because they show the offerors performance on quality, cost control, timeliness and business relations.  If an offeror does not have relevant past performance evaluations on contracts, past performance evaluations on relevant grants will be considered.

8) Is past performance information required from all individual organizations within the partnership?

Past performance of the partnership as an entity is highly desirable. However, if the partnership is entirely new or includes new collaborators, past performance of individual collaborating organizations should be included. Please note that if an organization has a proposed subcontractor submitting a Past Performance evaluation form on this procurement, the name of the Prime Contractor should be included in order to be evaluated as part of the correct partnership.

9) If collaborators in a partnership have held federal contracts, and their performance on those contracts is relevant to the partnership's ability to demonstrate past performance quality, may these be included in the past performance evaluations?

Yes

10) It is the responsibility of the partnerships to ensure that their past performance evaluations are completed and forwarded on time directly to AHRQ by the contracting organizations listed in the Past Performance submission.  Can partnerships ask the contracting organizations to cc them on their responses to ensure that AHRQ has been sent the evaluations and that they should have been received on time?

Past performance evaluations are to be completed confidentially; offerors may not see the evaluations being submitted. Partnerships should emphasize to their evaluation contract organizations that evaluations must be received on time. Only those evaluations received by the date specified in the solicitation will be considered.  

11) How should relevant projects that have been funded internally by a health care provider as part of its operations or research and development be handled?  Should such projects be included in the organizational and corporate experience section of the technical proposal but not in the past performance section, since there are no external funders/clients to complete the past performance questionnaire and contractor performance form?

Yes, past performance evaluations should only be requested from external customers.
12) How many projects should be evaluated for the partnership as a whole? Does the number of evaluations vary with the size of the partnership?
Five relevant projects total should suffice unless the partnership is very large, in which case a few more examples could be added. 
D. Questions on Labor Categories and Rates

13) Although the RFP states that contractors shall be reimbursed for costs incurred for labor based on hourly rates, no rates are listed.  Is the offeror to provide the Proposed Labor Rates for each of the Years listed?

Yes, the offeror is to propose the Proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Ranges, for each of the Years listed for each of the six labor categories. The cost analysis will consist of establishing a Labor Category Hourly Rate Range for the six Labor Categories (I, II, III, IV, V and VI). 

14)  With regard to the presentation of labor rates by class level and year, would it be sufficient to provide a range, established on the basis of a sample of rates, within which we intend to stay?  Also, is there a specific inflation factor that should be used to show these labor rates in the out years or is the commonly used 3-4% acceptable?
 
A representative sample of positions that could be averaged to propose each Labor Category Hourly Rate Range per class is requested. The negotiations for the proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Range will include the evaluation of the reasonableness of the individual cost components (unburdened rate, indirect rates and fee/ profit, if applicable.)  The recommended labor escalation rate for future Government Fiscal Years should be approximately 3%. 

15) Is certified documentation of an indirect rate agreement approved for federal awards only necessary for the prime organization or for the other participants in the partnership as well?

It is required for the prime organization and each participant in the partnership as well If an indirect rate is not established by the time of contract award, the organization will be provided up to 90 days to establish the indirect cost rate.  

E. Questions on Participant Characteristics and Key Personnel

16) From the table in Appendix 4 it appears that some partner organizations should be providers/insurers.  In the section on partnership eligibility however, the list of organizations eligible to be included is much broader.  Please clarify.  Should Appendix 4 be completed for each partner organization or should it be a summary of all partner organizations including the offeror?

The table in Appendix 4 serves the purpose of very roughly summarizing for reviewers some characteristics of any participating organizations for which the named characteristics apply , particularly those serving patients, residents or health plan enrollees. Offerors are encouraged to present these characteristics either for the partnership as a whole or for individual participants in the partnership. AHRQs preference would be to report by organization, if feasible. Offerors are also encouraged to present, in similar table format, any desired complementary information (e.g., number of employers in a coalition and the employer characteristics.)   

17) Can the key personnel include people from each of the partner organizations?  Can major subcontractors be key personnel?  Should it be assumed that each partner organization has a key person tied to it?

Yes, key personnel may include persons from collaborating organizations as well as the prime organization. It is correct to assume that each collaborating organization should have a designated main contact. 

18) If the chart in Appendix 4 that documents delivery system settings and providers does not fit the offeror partnerships model of health care delivery. may an offeror redesign this table in order to document the types of services provided by its programs in the way which best reflects program reality? 

Feel free to add information in a separate table that may better reflect the components of the partnership in question. 

F. Questions on Small and Disadvantaged Businesses
19) Could AHRQ clarify the similarities and differences between a Small Business Subcontracting Plan and a Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan?   Could AHRQ clarify which of these two Plans should be addressed when an awardee responds to a task order?  
The requirement for the Small Business Subcontracting Plan and the Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be required only for task orders in excess of $500,000. The purpose of the Small Business Subcontracting Plan (FAR 19.704  )is to  provide information as to how an offeror plans to meet the DHHS/ AHRQ (departmental) goals for socioeconomic contracting for the instant procurement (particular task order in this case).   The Small Business Subcontract Plan will be negotiated on an as needed basis.   

The Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan (FAR 19.12) is a plan that provides information on how the organization as a whole has subcontracted with disadvantaged businesses in the past and how it plans to do so in the future.

20)  While the offeror realizes that no formal Subcontracting Plan or Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan is required with the initial proposal submission, and is only required at the Request for Task Order level, please clarify the SBA requirements that a prime contractor's small business percentages are derived from the total planned subcontract amount on Task Order proposals, not a percentage of the total Task Order value. 
 
The small business percentages would be derived from the total planned subcontract amount on the Task Order proposal.  Note the Task Order proposal amount may change as a result of negotiation. 

21) The RFP indicates that a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be requested if a future Task Order meets or exceeds the $500,000 threshold.  Could AHRQ clarify whether a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan should be included in the current proposal response to this RFP and if so, is this applicable both to the prime and to major subcontractors (if any of them are not small businesses)?  Is there any added value for including Small Disadvantaged Business Participation plan in the current proposal application?   

The proposal is not required to include either a Small Business Subcontracting Plan or a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan in order to be responsive to the RFP.  The submission of a Small Business Participation Plan with the proposal would add no value to the proposal. 

G. Question on Review Committee

22) Will there be any non-academically affiliated health care provider organizations represented on the ACTION II proposal review committee? 

AHRQs statute requires that all contract proposals are peer reviewed by reviewers who do not have a conflict of interest with any of the offerors participating organizations.  Reviewers names remain confidential and are not be released even through the Freedom of Information Act in order to ensure an impartial evaluation. AHRQ appreciates your suggestion.
 
H. Question on Proposal Delivery to AHRQ 

23) Please indicate whether other express mail services (such as UPS or Federal Express) may be used to deliver the proposal AHRQs Rockville, Maryland address and if there are security restrictions that would delay timely receipt of a proposal using express or other mail services.  

The offeror may use any express mail carrier it chooses. The offeror assumes responsibility for that choice (i.e., an error or delay encountered by the express carrier is the responsibility of the offeror).  Please be cautioned that security restrictions at AHRQ may delay timely receipt of a proposal.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure the proposal arrives on or before the deadline. Also be cautioned that a proposal missing any required components (e.g., insufficient number of copies) will not be accepted.






















APPENDIX 2

AHRQ PORTFOLIOS

The AHRQ portfolios are used to organize and prioritize research supported by the Agency. These portfolios have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and how the products and findings of the research are disseminated.  Each portfolio has a portfolio team and team lead.  AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge transfer (OCKT) has organized its communication and dissemination activities by assigning strategic planners to work with each portfolio team.  Where appropriate, AHRQ Task Order Officers will coordinate AHRQ portfolio teams and OCKT's strategic planners to disseminate and market ACTION II research products and findings resulting from ACTION II task orders. 

                                  Description of AHRQ Portfolios
Comparative Effectiveness
The mission of the comparative effectiveness portfolio is to provide health care decision makersincluding patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakerswith up-to-date, evidence-based information about their treatment options to make informed health care decisions. 
Health Information Technology
This portfolio aims to identify challenges to health information technology (IT) adoption and use, solutions and best practices for making health IT work, and tools that will help hospitals and clinicians successfully incorporate new health IT. Research supported by the portfolio aims to develop evidence and inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. Further portfolio goals include making the best evidence and consumer health information available electronically when and where it is needed, and developing secure and private electronic health records.
 Innovations/Emerging Issues
At this time, the Innovations and Emerging Issues Portfolio is being established and is expected to evolve in the coming months. The portfolio aims to identify and support research that has the potential to lead to significant advances in health care. Research and activities will reflect ideas substantially different from those already being pursued by AHRQ, and will constitute transformative research to solve pressing health care problems
Patient Safety
This portfolio aims to identify risks and hazards that lead to medical errors and find ways to prevent patient injury associated with delivery of health care. Important goals include: providing information on the scope and impact of medical errors, identifying the root causes of threats to patient safety, and examining effective ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors. Disseminating and translating research findings and methods to reduce errors are also important. Additionally, the portfolio aims to develop an environment or culture within health care settings that encourages health professionals to share and report information about medical errors and ways to prevent them.
Prevention and Care Management
The mission of the prevention and care management portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings. Portfolio goals include: 1) supporting clinical decision making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations, and 2) developing the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through health care redesign, clinical-community linkages, self management support, integration of health information technology, and care coordination.
Value
The goal of the value portfolio is to help assure that consumers and patients are served by health care organizations that reduce unnecessary costs (waste) while maintaining or improving quality. This is done by developing measures, data, evidence, tools, and strategies that health care organizations, systems, insurers, purchasers, and policymakers use to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining or improving quality. Strategies include process redesign, leadership and management strategies, organizational and community-wide quality improvement initiatives, legal and regulatory changes, consumer choice, public reporting, incentives, and payment changes. Also, the portfolio conducts and supports methodological work and modeling to improve data and research, and to facilitate its use for policy and management. 





















APPENDIX 3 

SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ACTION PARTNERSHIPS


NEED TO ADD SOMETHING HERE REFERRING TO THE ININTIAL TASK ORDER FOR +/- $25 K FOR TRAVEL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRIME COORDINATING FUNCTION.

ACTION II Portal

AHRQ will develop and maintain an ACTION II portal to enhance collaborative efforts for all ACTION partnerships. The portal will include tools to support dialogue and collaboration, such as web conferencing capability, provision of collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will serve as an avenue for communication between Task Order Officers or other ACTION II staff, and contractors. The portal may be used to host teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

ACTION II Partnerships will play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository to be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 
, for example: contact information for partnership members, profiles for each of these members, a library of ACTION II-related templates and examples of documents, relevant published literature, and a calendar of events of interest.  

AHRQ will provide technical staff to operate and maintain portal software applications. The portal will maximize security and data privacy. 

Technical Assistance

On a case by case basis, technical assistance will be available to ACTION II Partnerships for:
1.	OMB clearance package development 
2.	Adherence to 508 compliance and web product requirements for all electronic deliverables
3.	Dissemination, communication and marketing for selected deliverables intended for public release


1.	OMB Clearance Package Development  

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance is an outgrowth of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. It was designed to minimize the burden that data collection activities might have on the public and to ensure the quality and utility of the information collected. OMB clearance is used interchangeably with ICR Clearance (Information Collection Request Clearance) or PRA Clearance (Paperwork Reduction Act Clearance). 

OMB Clearance is needed for all federal contract research if any data collection activities involve ten or more respondents for whom the questions are standardized in nature. This includes any instances where an interview schedule composed of a set of core questions will be used for 10 or more subjects, even if it is modified for subgroups of nine or fewer interviewees (e.g. doctors vs. nurses, managers vs. front-line employees). These data collection activities include research project surveys, interviews, questionnaires, epidemiology studies, health risk factor assessments, and evaluations. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Clearance and OMB Clearance are two separate clearances. Having one of the two clearances does not negate the need for the other. 

The normal OMB Clearance process currently takes approximately 7-9 months from beginning to end.  More details about the timeline are available at http://www.os.dhhs.gov/ocio/policy/collection/infocollectiontimeline.html.  An OMB Clearance Package includes a number of documents and processes. These include:

a.  83-I: A Form that provides a listing of the information required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of which copies are submitted with each package to be reviewed by OMB.  
b.  Supporting Statement:  The supporting statement consists of two parts and follows a standard format.  Section A provides the justification for the proposed data collection activity and Section B outlines the statistical methods and design. The supporting statement is generally prepared by the group contracted to conduct the research on behalf of AHRQ.

c. Attachments: Any additional materials supporting the proposed data collection or instruments that will be used as part of the study are included as attachments, such as data collection instrument(s); a copy of the Federal Register Notice; a copy of instructions or letters sent to respondents describing the study; a copy of applicable sections of laws or regulations regarding the data collection (may not be applicable); and a list of consulted individuals (if a focus group or expert panel was consulted during the development of the data collection instrument). 

ACTION II Partnerships must comply with OMB Clearance for task orders whenever applicable (see Requirement #12 in SOW).  Thus, each ACTION II Partnership will be required to identify an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization to be responsible for ensuring that such federal requirements are met and coordinating all activities associated with doing so. 

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to obtain OMB Clearances and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request to subcontract for the expertise, using task order award funds, through a pre-arranged AHRQ contractor. Arrangements to work with the subcontractor to develop the OMB Clearance package shall be included in the technical proposal and the cost of the subcontract shall be included in the cost proposal for the task order in question. That is to say, whether the proposal team requests a subcontractor through AHRQ or supplies the expertise itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs.

2. Adherence to Section 508 Compliance and Web Product Requirements 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 
There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format - including text, audio or video - that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 
All contractors and subcontractors or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards as codified in 36 CFR Part 1194, and where applicable, those set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). Remediation of any materials that do not comply with all necessary accessibility standards shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.  Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to meet these federal requirements for electronic products and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request assistance from AHRQs Section 508 Technical Assistance Center (www.ahrw.gov/508tac/tacover.htm). The Centers web page includes a menu of services and the charges related to each requested service. Services include: conversion and remediation of developed, non-compliant products, training and education, and consulting and expert services.  If a Partnership plans to avail itself of specific Section 508 Technical Assistance Center services, the technical task order proposal shall include information on necessary tasks to be accomplished via a subcontract with Section 508 Technical Assistance Center staff; the cost of the required services shall be included in the cost proposal. 

In addition to assistance with adherence to Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act, the Center can assist with website usability of task order products, and other HHS and federal regulations regarding management, privacy and security of IT systems, and/or designing websites and creating website graphics. Technical assistance will be available for ACTION II contractors that need help to support evolving user needs for electronic products, or improved system administration, performance, search, navigation and usability for such products. In addition, technical assistance may include development of websites and other electronic products that are in full compliance with all relevant sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In addition to the Section 508 compliance Web resources provided above, information on accessibility can be found at:

o	www.usability.gov 

4. Dissemination, Communication and Marketing

Simply providing information to potential users is insufficient to generate substantial rates of actual use of the information by specific target audiences. A key to successful implementation in health care delivery is to more closely link researchers, users and other decision makers to ensure both the usefulness of information generated and the actual use of that information in practice. The literature suggests that actual use of research increases when:
	The research findings meet the expressed needs of the target audience
	Short-term and long-term information-sharing relationships and networks are created between researchers and target audiences
	An integrated set of strategies and tactics, specifically designed to support practical use of research, is employed over a substantial period of time. 

For ACTION II project results considered by AHRQ to merit further investment in dissemination, communication and marketing, technical assistance from AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) may include, but is not limited to: 
	creation of varied and appropriate dissemination products and vehicles
	assistance in determining the most appropriate target audiences and the content needs of those audiences
	performing and promoting website marketing and dissemination; and/or convening technical expert panels and meetings
	identifying, conducting, preparing and delivering educational activities, teleconferences and webinars
	identifying opportunities for collaboration and sharing of ideas, approaches, best practices and lessons learned across AHRQ grantees, contractors and project initiatives, and coordinating and facilitating identified common activities and interests across these efforts where cost-effective
	providing assistance in use of health information exchanges, IT networks, connectivity, hardware, software, interoperability and standards
	designing and offering special, limited technical assistance engagements, to meet the needs of regional AHRQ partners, stakeholders and others in their project efforts.
	Reviewing awardee final reports and findings, providing summaries of key findings, lessons learned and best practices identified while providing technical assistance.
	devising adoption strategies that can be readily accepted and are likely to be sustained. Examples may include issue papers, briefs, implementation stories, podcasts, Webinars, etc. 

The value of task order deliverables for intended audiences it is not always known with certainty in advance. As such, this level of dissemination, communication and marketing activity is not necessarily expected to be included in a task order proposal.  However, if AHRQ deems that additional dissemination, communication and marketing for a specific deliverable is likely to have potential value, the Partners involved will be expected to work collaboratively with OCKT staff to  at a minimum - familiarize them with the features, benefits and limitations of the task order deliverables in question.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 13.105 SYNOPSIS AND POSTING REQUIREMENTS, THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION, A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690.

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the tasks identified below: 


Services and Prices/Costs

Labor/Cost Category	Rate	U/I	Quantity	Total Price
				
				
Expected Period of Performance
1 year from date of award


Background

The Office of Biostatistics needs a biomedical statistician to review routine submissions but also complex submissions that require a high level of statistical expertise and experience.  There are several current areas of critical importance to the Division that require significant statistical expertise.  Two of the most important areas are adaptive clinical trial designs and the assessment of cardiovascular (CV) risk in drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Statement of Work

Tasks

The Contractor shall write statistical reviews and evaluations of clinical data contained in New Drug Applications (NDAs), Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions, and related documents.  Data to be reviewed are those submitted from drug sponsors primarily to the Division of Metabolic and Endocrine Products (DMEP) within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at FDA. 

The Contractor will define and develop new formulas, tests, procedures and refine existing procedures as necessary to evaluate new, novel or complex problems. 

Responsibilities include attending and participating in internal meetings with FDA staff and industry meetings with drug sponsors to discuss their drug development programs.  To enhance interaction between the Contractor, FDA staff and industry, it is required that attendance at both internal and industry meetings be on-site (FDA headquarters at White Oak, Maryland) and not off-site via telecom.  It is estimated there will be two to three such meetings per week.

The Contractor shall study the statistical literature to maintain proficiency in statistical expertise with particular attention to statistical methods related to adaptive clinical trial designs, non-inferiority designs and trial designs for the assessment of CV risk in drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The Contractor shall keep the Project Officer informed of progress on IND and NDA written reviews.

Knowledge/Skills

The Contractor shall have extensive knowledge of statistical theory and methods as applied to adaptive clinical trial designs, non-inferiority designs and clinical trials for the assessment of CV risk.  The Contractor shall also have a thorough knowledge of survival analyses and meta-analytic techniques as well as expertise in clinical trial design and statistical methods.

The Contractor must be able to immediately begin and satisfactorily complete work assignments without formal training.  As such, the Contractor must have experience as a statistical reviewer of IND and NDA submissions containing clinical trials involving the assessment of CV risk in drugs for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes or hyperlipidemia.

The Contractor should be able to interact frequently with medical officers and project officers at FDA and with other technical disciplines as needed (clinical pharmacology, pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, chemistry) in order to be a fully functioning member of the project team assigned to a specific IND or NDA.

The Contractor shall have the ability to communicate findings and statistical information verbally and in writing at an exceptional level.

The Contractor shall be free of financial conflicts of interest with the regulated industry.   Specifically, the Contractor may not hold financial interests in companies which are significantly regulated by the FDA consistent with current policies by the FDA Ethics Program that prohibit certain financial interests for FDA employees.

The contractor is entitled to paid leave corresponding to Federal holidays.


Evaluation Criteria

Award will be made to the party whose proposal offers the best value to the Government; technical, price, and other factors considered.

The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Qualifications & Availability of Proposed Personnel 2) Understanding the Requirements & Technical Approach and 3) Price.  Qualifications/Availability of Proposed Personnel is more important than Understanding the Requirements/Technical Approach and each of these factors are significantly more important than price.

Offerors must identify staff and describe their capabilities and expertise in substantive areas related to activities described in the Statement of Work. 

Personnel proposed to be assigned and available for work under the project shall be evaluated on their demonstrated, documented, and relevant expertise, education, availability, and experience as it relates to the requirement described in the Statement of Work.  

Supporting documentation about the experience, training, and education (e.g., CVs) of proposed personnel must be provided.  

2.  Understanding the Requirements & Technical Approach

Provide a comprehensive statement of the scope and purpose of the project to demonstrate complete understanding of the intent and requirements. This understanding indicates a clear comprehension and awareness of the contract objectives.

Proposal will be evaluated on the following:
a.  Understanding of the purpose and scope of work to be accomplished such as experience providing statistical consultation.
b.  Describe in detail the methodologies that would be used for the project, indicating level of experience with each. 

The technical proposal shall be submitted electronically via e-mail to the Contracting Officer.  The technical proposal described above shall be limited to 10 pages double-spaced not including resumes or bibliographies, with no less than an 11 point font.
 
The price proposal shall not be included in the technical proposal. It shall be sent via email to the Contracting Officer as a separate document.

The Offerors proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work. Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of the Agencys scope of work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as will comply or standard techniques will be employed. The technical proposal must include a detailed description of the techniques and procedures to be used in achieving the proposed end results in compliance with the requirements of the Agencys scope of work.

<DESC>Amendment 001 -- posted 15 March to answer a question that was emailed.  

Question:  In Solicitation No. AG-0120-S-10-0013, you have required a "roof anchorage cable(?)".  Does that really run outside the walls, over the eaves and over the roof decking and, more specifically, is it required for the trout Lake cabin where the wind load requirement is higher?

Answer:  The requirement for the roof anchorage cable is being removed from solicitation AG-0120-S-10-0013.  Not necessary for the location where this cabin will be located.

<DESC>SCOPE OF SERVICES - Visitor Use and Experience - DENA Road Vehicle Management Plan - EISThis is a modification to Announcement No. A1000000991Please submit your proposal via email to kirsten_giddens@nps.gov by close of business March 22, 2010. PROJECT BACKGROUNDOver the next two years, the NPS shall be developing the Denali Park Road Vehicle Management Plan and EIS. The purpose of the plan is to establish the vision, goals, and strategies for managing vehicles along the Denali Park Road, including user capacity, in order to best manage demand while preserving visitor experiences and park resources and values. The Denali Park Road Vehicle Management Plan shall guide decision making and management of vehicles on the park road for the next 15 to 20 years. The planning process represents an intensive effort involving subject matter experts on transportation, visitor use, and resource management; park managers; stakeholders; local, state and federal governments; and interested members of the public. 
In January 2010, the park staff released an alternatives workbook to the public that describes four draft management alternatives for the vehicle management plan, including the No-Action Alternative. In addition to the workbook, public meetings are being held in February to seek public comments on the draft management alternatives. The park staff shall collect and analyze the public comments and make any necessary changes to the alternatives in the next several months. The next steps of the project are to analyze the impacts of the alternatives, prepare a public draft EIS, complete a final EIS and prepare a final decision-making document (record of decision). 
PURPOSE OF SCOPE OF SERVICESThe purpose of this scope of services is to identify technical support from the contractor to assist the NPS in its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance activities for the Denali Park Road Vehicle Management Plan, EIS, as they relate to visitor use and experience. The contractor shall be working directly with the DSC Planning Division in support of planning efforts at Denali National Park. 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTSIn general, the contractor shall rely on existing information, including other park specific NEPA documents, to support development of the Vehicle Management Plan EIS. The contractor shall participate in the preparation of the draft and final versions of various sections (further described below) of the EIS relating to visitor use and experience and incorporate multiple review comments in a format that complies with the Department of the Interior and NPS policies for implementing NEPA. The EIS shall conform to all applicable NPS requirements including, but not limited to, those specified in NPS Management Policies 2006, Director's Order #12 and Handbook: Conservation Planning, Environmental Impact Analysis, and Decision Making, the NPS Dynamic Park Planning Sourcebook, and DSC Editing Reference Manual. The first two references may be found at http://home.nps.gov/applications/npspolicy/DOrders.cfm. The last is located at http://www.nps.gov/dsc/c_business/c_2_editing.htm.
The DSC and Park shall provide to the contractor all existing information, such as visitor use statistics, use patterns on the park road, results of visitor surveys and other NEPA documents that are relevant (see below).  
The EIS shall include a complete discussion of the affected environment and a detailed analysis of the impacts to visitor uses and visitor experiences as a result of implementing each of the alternatives, including the No-Action. Impact analysis shall be limited to issues associated with implementation of the proposed alternatives only. The final list of impact topics to be analyzed shall be determined during a project workshop currently targeted for April 2010. The analysis shall include an impairment assessment and identification and analysis of cumulative effects and potential mitigation measures to effects. This contract does not include additional field studies. 
The contractor shall coordinate with the NPS through the DSC Visitor Use Technical Lead and Project Manager on acceptable levels of data analysis, assumptions, and analytical methods. The contractor shall integrate data and analysis supplied by the NPS and other federal or contractor personnel who may be asked by the DSC to provide input or information in specialized areas of jurisdiction or expertise.
Contractor tasks may include but not be limited to: conducting literature searches; preparing charts and tables; interpreting data; interviewing experts; and documenting such research, analyses, or use of professional judgment in the absence of preexisting information. The contractor shall also be required to participate in meetings and teleconferences with the NPS and other contractors.

All information presented shall be adequately referenced and in a style readily comprehended by the public. The contractor shall include supporting charts and tables as needed.Deliverables: Draft visitor use/experience section of affected environment.  Target Deadline:  August 30, 2010
3.4 Chapter 4 - Environmental Consequences - The contractor shall prepare the visitor use and experience section of Chapter 4 of the draft EIS per DO-12 guidelines and DSC Editing Reference Manual. The contractor shall develop the methodologies and assumptions for analyzing impacts for NPS review and approval. Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences, provides the reader with an analytic evaluation of the potential effects or impacts of each of the alternatives on the resources described in the affected environment section. The objective analysis and disclosure of potential environmental impacts of alternatives facilitates informed decision making. This analysis and disclosure of impacts shall be provided in this section, with the contractor presenting the effects of each alternative on the visitor use and experience components of the affected environment. The contractor shall include supporting charts and tables as necessary to illustrate findings and conclusions.Council on Environmental Quality regulations require that impact analyses include discussions of adverse and beneficial effects, short- and long-term effects, direct and indirect effects, and cumulative effects. The contractor shall identify and characterize all such effects of each alternative. The characterization of impacts shall include descriptions of impact duration, intensity (or magnitude), and context (site-specific, local, regional, or national effects, etc.). Conclusions on impacts should not be presented without supporting analysis; the rationale for the conclusion must be provided. The contractor, through the course of the analysis, may suggest revisions to the methodologies and impact criteria if warranted; however, these elements may not be changed without consent of the NPS. The contractor shall consult with the lead NPS specialists as needed to obtain more detailed technical and support information pertaining to impact topic thresholds and definitions. The contractor shall use the impact analysis to help NPS to determine the potential for impairment to park resources from each of the alternatives on each relevant resource (see NPS Management Policies 2006). Impairment and non-impairment findings shall be included in the conclusion statements for each impact topic.Also included in Chapter 4 is an assessment of cumulative impacts. In collaboration with NPS and other sources, the contractor shall first identify those "other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions" comprising the cumulative impact scenario. For example, these actions may include projects within the park but outside the scope of the project and/or projects or activities on adjacent lands by other entities. Then for each impact topic/resource affected under each alternative that is analyzed in detail, the contractor shall analyze cumulative effects by adding the incremental impact of the alternative actions to impacts resulting from "other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable" actions. "Other past, present and reasonably foreseeable" actions should be identified and approved by NPS prior to engaging in cumulative effect analysis. The resulting cumulative impacts shall be identified and characterized. The preparation of legally defensible cumulative impact analyses is a key element of the environmental consequences chapter. Recent case law has demonstrated its importance.Deliverables: Draft visitor use/experience sections of impact analysis.  Target Deadline:  September 20, 2010
3.5 References, Glossary, Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Appendices - The contractor shall develop a reference list, glossary, acronyms and abbreviations, and appendices that relate to the visitor use and visitor experience sections of the document.

<p><br />&emsp;<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>ANSWERS TO QUESTONS RECEIVED.

Question 1:    What size is the water main that the fire hydrants                      will be attached to.  Not able to determine from the                      drawings. 
RESPONSE:   6 inch transient pipe or AC.

Question 2:   How will water be shut down during the process ?                     Don't believe there is controlling valve to shut of individually.                     We noted a hospital in close proximity during the visit.                     Will shut down affect the hospital ?
RESPONSE:  Hospital will be re-routed and highly recommend to change out the hydrant during weekends, if so the contractorhas to make their arrangement with the concrete company if utilizing a concrete for the construction. That means the contractorhas to expose the fire hydrant or prepare to change it over duringweek days and have the hydrant change during the weekend.

Question 3:   Who will shut down the water, the contractor or the BIA ? 
RESPONSE:  Have schedule with our department so we can havethe water shut down-in previously fire hydrant change over we hadthe contractor turned on and shut the water off themselves - we justshow them where the valves was located and this was done on the weekend.  This how we change over the previously 6 hydrantsthe last time.

Question 4:  Who is responsible for securing the power pole next to                     next to one of the fire hydrants ? 
RESPONSE:  We can contact the power company and notify them of the work and from then on they will let us know who is responsiblefor the power poles. When the Blue Staking is done this should be included of what one should do if there should be a utility located by the fire hydrants.

Question 5  A few of the existing fire hydrants have a bollard in frontof them.  Do you want us to include installing (2) new ballards in frontof each fire hydrant ?
RESPONSE:  YES

Question 6:  After looking at each hydrant, they are all in dirt so we areassuming that we will not have to provide any asphalt or concrete of any kind.  Would that be correct ? 
RESPONSE:  EACH HYDRANT SHOULD HAVE THE BREAK AWAY BOLTSEXPOSED ABOVE GROUND AND THIS WILL AVOID HAVING THE HYDRANTBURIED IN THE GROUND (RAISE THE HYDRANTS ABOVE GROUND). IF THERE SHOULD BE AN ASPHALT OR CONCRETE REMOVED BY THE HYDRANTS THEN IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.

Question 7:  If we have to remove part of a fence line or concrete curbto complete installation of the fire hydrant, should we include that cost of installing new fence or curb if necessary ? 
RESPONSE:  YES.  EVERYTHING REMOVED SHOULD BE REPLACED-IF DAMAGED, OTHERWISE THE FENCING MATERAIL CAN BE RE-USED,WHERE THE CURBING CANNOT BE RE-USED.

Question 8:  Do we bring our sealed bid to the 2600 N. Central Ave,Suite #450 location?
RESPONSE:  Please direct your attention to the Standard Form 1442, Item 13which reads:  "Sealed offers in original and 1 copies to perform the workrequired are due at the place specified in Item 8 by 2:00 PM local time,03-16-2010 (date).

<DESC> The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around MARCH 15, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.

1.)  The cutting to specifications of 116.7 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, at which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date, or use the materials for Forest Service projects. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.
2.)  The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, or transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
3.)  The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
4.)  Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
5.)  In Units selected by the Contractor to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
6.)  There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.

COLLABORATIVE RESTORATION STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT 
MALHEUR, UMATILLA, WALLOWA WHITMAN AND OCHOCO NATIONAL FORESTS

This solicitation will result in multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) (also known as a task order contracts), performance based service contracts spanning approximately five (5) years.  The Government intends to make multiple awards to both industry (businesses interested in purchasing biomass) and service contractors.

Over the duration of the contract, individual task orders with actual quantities will be competed.  Only vendors in the initial contract award pool will be allowed to submit a quote on the work offered, but are not required to offer on all orders.  No restrictions have been set regarding the number of vendors in the award pool, however, sufficient awards will be made to provide for adequate competition of task orders.  

The intent of this contract is to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing and/or rearranging the existing fuel loading on selected project areas located on Malheur, Umatilla, Wallowa-Whitman and Ochoco National Forests.  All biomass that is removed will be sold to industry.

The resultant contracts will be firm-fixed price task order service contracts with provisions for timber removal.  The solicitation will be available approximately May 26, 2009.

A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled.  It is anticipated this conference will be held on or around     June 8, 2009 and the exact date and time will be designated in the solicitation.

If you have questions about this project please contact Gary Dillavou Contract Specialist at (541) 278-3841.

Solicitation will now be posted on or about June 1, 2009.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain Refrigerated Trailers as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.  A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services. This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet. Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer. A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication. Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected. The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR). Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system. Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account. The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud. The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website: http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php. 1525

<DESC>RECOVERY-PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO Veolia Water North America Operating Service, Inc. under current contract number:  DAAE30-02-C-1101.  Erroneously this notice was originally reported to be awarded to Chugach, Inc. under Contract Number:  W15QKN-05-C-1023 (solicitation number:  W15QKN-10-T-0603).   This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a modification under an existing contract.  This contract modification was not awarded as a firm fixed price contract type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded for commercial supplies and services per FAR 12.207(b).  This award in the amount of $5,000 was for repair parts to replace failing components on the existing Telemetry/SCADA System in the control room of the Water Plant Bldg. 1383, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ under Project 28696.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.
This task will involve collecting geographic coordinates on approximately 1250 corners of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) across 125 townships.  Most corners will be section corners but some will be mineral survey corners that have not been visited since they were originally set in the 1800s.  The goal is to reasonably depict these areas in GCDB.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  LR2000 is a database of the title information contained on Master Title Plats (MTP).  In order to support these initiatives, BLM will examine existing and published data sets with greater scrutiny and update GCDB and the published data sets as necessary.
This task will merge GCDB data with LR2000 to create a digital status map that can be compared to Master Title Plats to identify errors in all three data sets.  Inspection and comparison of data sets will be on renewable energy townships around the entire state of Colorado.  There are 1420 townships identified as having potential renewable energy use.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY-THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.&nbsp; THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ05QA00013.&nbsp; THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.</p>
<p>This opportunity was available only to the Res-Care, Inc. under contract number DOLJ05QA00013.&nbsp; The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $34,223 to the Edison Job Corps Center, operated by Res-Care, Inc.&nbsp; These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).</p>
<p>FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.&nbsp; Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.&nbsp; Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification. As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.</p>
<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives: 1) Training Vehicle for Automotive Career Techincal Training classroom and Driver's Education Simulator; and 2) Earth Day Every Day, to assist with preparation and execution of the week's activities.&nbsp; This budget has been allocated to center operators from ARRA funds and should only be used to purchase activity supplies outlined in the booklet referenced in PIN 09-33, as well as to procure a tree and tree marker for the center.&nbsp; The operator of the Edison Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This modification has been awarded on March 15, 2010.</p>

<DESC>Fabrication of Pre-GTA Water Impact Test Article Heat Shield DomesNASA Langley Research Center has a requirement for Pre-GTA Water Impact Test Article HeatShield Domes in support of the Orion Structural Passive Landing Attenuation forSurvivability of Human Crew (SPLASH) Project.  Similar to the Apollo spacecraft, butlarger in size, the Orion Crew Module has a cone-shaped Crew Module that is protectedfrom Earth reentry heating by a dish-shaped main heat shield.  After completing itsmission in space, the Orion Crew Module will land in the Pacific Ocean, post Earthreentry, very similar to the Apollo Crew Module; where the heat shield will be theprimary load path for water impact loads. The Orion Program will be conducting waterimpact testing of a Crew Module simulator deemed "boilerplate" to aid in the correlationand verification of analytical models used in the structural sizing of the Orion CrewModule flight-design.  The Crew Module boilerplate heat shield will not need to becapable of surviving reentry heating, but must duplicate the geometry of the flight CrewModule for hydrodynamic reasons and perform structurally when subjected to Orion CrewModule water impact environments.Price includes base dome plus two optional domes.

<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:<br />A six and one-half (6.5) month extension of Lease No. 062-2007-LNB-E0033 for 2,191 square feet of special use space at 200 Forrestal Road, on the Forrestal Campus of Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT (INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE):<br />The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) is a NOAA research facility located on the Forrestal Campus of Princeton University. GFDL has contracted for asbestos abatement and building renovation services. During this period, the GFDL targeted the current library space to use as swing space for the construction, and relocated the library to new leased space under the subject Lease. The asbestos abatement project has not been completed as planned and the library cannot yet be moved back into its original location. Therefore the short-term lease must be extended until all projects and moves are completed. The cost for these additional 6.5 months of the lease will be $17,730.67.</p>
<p>IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY:<br />41 USC 253 (c) (1); FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (a) (1) and (2). Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or servicers will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>UNIQUE QUALIFICATION OF PROPOSED CONTRACTOR OR NATURE OF ACQUISITION REQUIRING AUTHORITY CITED: This is a short-term extension of a lease originally acquired by full and open competition. The GFDL is in occupancy and will be removing in a short time to its original occupancy, also on the campus of Princeton University.</p>
<p>EFFORTS TO ENSURE SOLICITATION FROM MAXIMUM SOURCES PRACTICAL: There will be no efforts to identify other possible locations.</p>
<p>DETERMINATION THAT ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:<br />A comparison of rental market rates in the Princeton area indicates that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>OTHER FACTORS SUPPORTING JUSTIFICATION: None.</p>
<p>LISTING OF SOURCES EXPRESSING INTEREST IN SOLICITATION: Not applicable.</p>
<p>I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. Agency requirements supporting this justification for other than full and open competition are certified as accurate and complete on the attached.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-09-0001.  Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>HSTS03-06-P-CIO593
<DESC>Intent to Acquire Using Other than Full and Open Competition
<p>This procurement action is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, whereas there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>TSA budgets, staffs, and manages over 40,000 employees at more than 400 locations. For the last four years, in order to ensure that personnel resources are scheduled and used as effectively and efficiently as possible, TSA has utilized an automated schedule optimization and administration software, SABRE StaffPlan and SABRE StaffAdmin. This Notice documents the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) intent to contract using other than full and open competition for licensing and maintenance associated with the use of SABRE StaffPlan and SABRE StaffAdmin software applications for up to 18 months. It is anticipated that there will be a base period of 6 months with two (2) 6 month options.</p>
<p>TSA is in the process of reassessing its scheduling and operational requirements, including, those requirements for the functionality provided by SABRE StaffAdmin and SABRE StaffPlan. Until final requirements are documented, it is necessary for the TSA to continue using the SABRE products mentioned above to ensure the efficient and effective management of Transportation Security Officer's work schedules nationwide. Failure to continue using the SABRE licenses will cause a significant disruption of scheduling TSO's and could lead to a potentially less effective security organization. Without a proper scheduling application in place, TSA would risk having periods of over and under staffing based on changes in staffing requirements throughout the day, week, and year. The absence of these SABRE software applications would also prevent TSA from effectively budgeting the workforce and could potentially lead to over and understaffing between airports as a result of constantly changing screening equipment and flight activity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a contract to SABRE Incorporated, 3150 Saber Drive Southlake TX 76092-2100. This contract will address the requirements of TSA's Office of Security Operations (OSO) work.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>

<DESC>The subject contract was awarded to develop a master plan which detailed the USAMMCE requirements for the customers served, the anticipated space requirements of the new location, the existing conditions of the medical logistics support, the recommended functional alignment, and the recommended moves, upgrades and/or new facilities necessary to support the mission of USAMMCE. 

The effort planned under this modification is key and essential to on-going planning efforts in support of the transformation and relocation of USAMMCE.  Recent leadership decisions regarding specific new locations proposed for USAMMCE require further analysis of the locations designated facilities and identification of renovation and upgrade requirements.  Given these recent developments and pending a new contract in support of USAMMCE requirements, it is in the best interest of USAMMCE to have continued professional consulting support. A gap in this support will result in USAMMCE not being able to provide renovation and funding requirements in a timely manner.
