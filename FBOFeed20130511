<DESC>Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) in support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District for Maintenance Dredging of James River, Virginia. The project consists of maintenance dredging and disposal of dredged material by hydraulic dredge and pipeline at various shoal locations on the James River Federal Navigation Channel. The work includes maintenance dredging to required depths of 18 to 26 feet with 1 foot of allowable overdepth at each respective dredging depth unless indicated otherwise in the Task Order. The Contractor shall place the dredged material in the designated Government-furnished upland or overboard placement areas as identified in the Task Order. The first task order is anticipated to be issued shortly after contract award. The total SATOC contract is for a base period plus two option periods that shall not exceed $12,000,000.00. THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT. NAICS CODE 237990 applies to this procurement. <br /><br />Submission requirements (plans/specs) will be available on/about 30 APRIL 2013 via Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps, https://www.fbo.gov). Search on W91236% for solicitations issued by Norfolk District. No hard copies will be available. Prospective contractors must be registered Vendors with https://www.fbo.gov in order to download plans and specifications. Prospective contractors MUST be registered in the DOD System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to obtain access to FedBizOpps. It is incumbent upon vendors to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation, specification, drawings, and all subsequent amendments. SAM Registration must also be ACTIVE and current to be eligible for contract award. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov. Lack of registration in the SAM database will prevent access to FedBizOpps and will make an Bidder ineligible for award. NOTE: Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) apply to this solicitation. With ORCA, vendors have the ability to enter and maintain representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov; therefore, vendors no longer have to submit representations and certifications with bid. Instead, this solicitation contains a single provision that will allow vendor to either certify that all representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of signature, or list any changes. <br />
