<CONTACT>ANN CAPRON CONTRACTING OFFICER 3034452429     acapron@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification, including the name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the procurement office above. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement from the TSC Economics Group to conduct economic impact analyses on various Reclamation-owned facilities for the Safety, Security and Law Enforcement (SSLE) Office.  To estimate secondary impacts to these facilities requires models and modeling techniques that the economics group does not have access to.  The secondary impacts are a large and important component to the impact analysis.  The method chosen to estimate secondary impacts must be technically sound and have applicability to Reclamation facilities. The purpose of this work is to develop a secondary impacts estimation tool for the Economics Group to use to estimate secondary economic impacts for Safety, Security and Law Enforcement (SSLE) studies where uncontrolled releases of water at Reclamation facilities occur.   The creation of this tool will require the economic findings from the "Economic Consequences Assessment Model" (ECAM) which is a proprietary model developed by the contractor and previously run for another Reclamation research project for SSLE.  The output from ECAM plus a short description of the data will assist in the completion of the research project for the SSLE Office. It is expected that a generalized urban-regional model of the target economy where agents react and optimize in order to minimize the adverse consequences related to an uncontrolled dam release will be used. Typically, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used for this purpose. The optimization model will be combined with detailed accounts of production and consumption for the region. This data will primarily come from the IMPLAN database.  The IMPLAN database can distinguish more than 500 sectoral and government activities at the county level. The exact formulation of the CGE model, which portions of the IMPLAN dataset, and what additional data will be incorporated are components of the methodology that will be determined during this phase of the project. This modeling tool is a direct result of the research performed by the Economics Group as to the type of tool would be necessary to perform secondary impacts estimation of uncontrolled releases at Reclamation facilities. Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from Miles Lite of Miles Light Research Faculty, Business Research Div., Univ. of Colorado and proposes to negotiate a contract with this company on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists.  Therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>This requirement is for a new high precision supersonic wind tunnel Model Injection System (MIS) mechanism shall be fabricated, shop assembled  and tested, disassembled and shipped to site, installed and tested at the  site.  A detailed design and specification package for the MIS will be  provided by the Government.  The demolition of an existing MIS mechanism  is also included in this contract The demolition and installation work  shall be performed at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee. The new MIS mechanism is a high precision positioning system used to  locate and orient test models in supersonic tunnel test section under a  wide variation of aerodynamic loads.  The overall dimensions of the new  MIS are 18'-4" high x 5'-5" wide x 9'-10" long and it weighs approximately  15,000 lbs. The MIS consists of multiple components and equipment.  Some of the key  fabricated and machined components are described below. The axial frame is a large welded and bolted structure that requires  accurate machining of long surfaces.  Four linear rails bolt directly to  the axial frame and must be oriented in near perfect parallelism, the  machining of the rail mounting surfaces is critical.  The frame sections  measure approximately 15 ft x 7 ft and require machining accuracies of  0.003” on some surfaces. The sector assembly contains the Carriage Segment Gear which is a curved  track with an integral gear segment.  It is a highly precise part with a  radius of approximately 7 ft.  The 12 diametral pitch spur gear segment  contains 2000 teeth.  The edges of the track are precision ground with  case hardened surfaces for the pitch carriage rollers to ride upon. The roll mechanism is a high torque, highly precise gear box.  It requires  precision machining and grinding of round parts (turning) with required  accuracies as rigid as .0003”. The MIS also includes control systems such as the balancing system and  associated air circuit components, control cabinets, and control feedback  devices The demolition and installation work shall be performed in an existing  pressure tank located below the wind tunnel test section.  The pressure  tank is a welded steel pressure shell with the approximate dimensions of  14’L x 10’W x 25’D.  All demolition and installation materials must be  removed from the tank thru an existing door which is approximately 72”  wide x 79” high and is located at an elevation of 14’ above the bottom of  the tank. All work shall be completed within 15 months after contract award.  For more information on "Model Injection System", please refer to:  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=4136

If utilities are removed, service must be maintained to the existing facilities served by the utilities to be removed. 

The Contractor shall provide a complete utility site design.  No active piping or utility structures shall remain under new buildings footprints.  Existing piping and utility structures that will not be required in the new design shall be removed within the limits of disturbance.  Pipes that extend beyond the limits of disturbance shall be plugged at the limit line and abandoned beyond.  Existing utility structures that remain active within the limits of disturbance shall have the rims adjusted to be suitable for the finish grade and elevations required by the final design.  The design of the storm sewer system shall incorporate and connect to the existing system.  For the parking structure, an oil/water separator is required before runoff is sent into the storm sewer system.  It will be the Contractor's responsibility to obtain all additional information that may be required for complete permitting, design, and construction.  The site has an existing methane collection system.  Design project to minimize impact on the system.  Where existing system is disturbed by construction activities, restore system to ensure continuity of methane collection.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for technical efforts in the area of modeling and simulation (M&S) pertinent to the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO).  DMSO’s mission includes M&S coordination, M&S standards, and M&S services including: (1) Staffing and distributing DoD M&S plans, programs, policies, procedures, and DoD publications; (2) Promoting joint and cooperative research, development, acquisition, and operation of M&S systems, technologies, and capabilities among the DoD Components; (3) Managing and coordinating standardization efforts; (4) Establishing interoperability standards and protocols; (5) Performing studies and technical efforts to develop standards; (6) Acquiring, digesting, analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, storing, publishing and disseminating science and technology (S&T) information and engineering data; and (7) Providing advisory and other user services to their authorized user community.  During FY 2005, DMSO established an overarching program plan to address this mission.  This plan encompasses M&S coordination, joint and cooperative RDA and operation of M&S, standards, and common M&S services within DMSO’s strategic context.  This strategic context includes an interoperability strategic objective focusing on interoperable environments for simulated operations, range operations and real operations based on the understanding that these environments are becoming so intertwined that interoperability among them is essential.  The enabling capabilities for the required interoperability are focused in the areas of interfaces and representations.  The strategic context also includes an M&S management strategic objective focusing on plans, policies, procedures, publications, and needs & requirements to fully implement DoD Directive 5000.59, DoD M&S Master Plan.  The standardization program of the DMSO supports all aspects of modeling and simulation (M&S) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Standards represent the output of M&S technical initiatives by providing the documentation by which they may be applied or implemented. Recognizing the importance of standards to the overall M&S program, DMSO was designated as the Lead Standardization Activity (LSA) for the Modeling and Simulation Methods and Standards (MSSM) Area of the Defense Standardization Program (DSP).  Focus areas under this BAA include Simulation Interoperability, Component Interoperability, Scenario Representations, Operations Management Representations, Entity Representations, M&S Capabilities Based Assessment, M&S Support of JCIDS, M&S Resource Registries, M&S VV&A, and M&S Education.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Tolga Bilgin, Director, Project Development, Bilgin Elektrik, Kuleli Sokak, No. 87 Gaziosmanpasa, 06700 Ankara, Turkey, Phone: 90 (312) 446 3023, Fax:	90 (312) 437 4399. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for building a wind farm at Soma in Manisa Province, Turkey.

Bilgin Elektrik, a private company, is developing the Soma Wind Farm with its own resources.  The Soma Project is located in the Manisa Province (Soma and Kýrkaðaç Districts) in western Turkey.  The project is planned to have three 30 MW phases.  Turkey has a total electricity demand of approximately 150,000 GWh, currently being met by lignite fired plants, natural gas combined cycle plants and large hydropower projects.  With a young and growing population, low per capita electricity consumption, rapid urbanization and generally strong economic growth, Turkey has been one of the fastest growing power markets in the world for nearly two decades.  As such, demand is expected to increase in 2010 to 240,000 GWh and to 350,000 GwH in 2015.  In order to meet these growing needs, Turkey is beginning to evaluate alternative sources of energy supply, including increased natural gas development and environmentally sound renewable technologies that utilize Turkey’s extensive resources for renewable energy production.  Despite currently having a small electricity surplus, the high electricity demand growth rate assumes Turkey will be unable to satisfy this demand without building significant new capacity in the next 3-10 years.  

The following is the outline of the study:

•	Task 1 - Review of Available Data and Current System Configuration
•	Task 2 - Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Review
•	Task 3 - Regional Electricity Market and Technical Evaluation
•	Task 4 - Preparation of Preliminary Design and Estimates using different sizes and brands of suitable turbines
•	Task 5 - Environmental and Social / Development Impact Assessment
•	Task 6 - Preparation of Detailed Design and Estimates using different sizes and brands of suitable turbines
•	Task 7 - Financing Options Review
•	Task 8 - Tender Documents Preparation
•	Task 9 - Draft Final and Final Reports Preparation and Presentation

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $245,780 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, December 1, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The requirements for the .338 penetrator projectile are  very similar.  They will utilize the same process methodologies and process equipment.  Some of the tooling is the same.  This effort is a follow-on to existing 5.56mm and 7.62mm efforts.  Aerojet Ordnance has already developed some of the necessary tooling and process parameters they are uniquely  positioned to rapidly delivery the required quantities of penetrators.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is in need of a Ceramic Nano-powder reactor for installation at Picatinny Arsenal.  In order to assess industrial capability, A Sources Sought (W15QKN-05-X-0710) was issued in July of this year.  Tekna Plasma Siystems was the only respondent to that request.  The Tekna response indicated that they were aware of the complex nature of the Army's needs,  and that they had an off-the-shelf system that could satisfy those needs with only minor adjustments to their design.  Additionally, they have provided the Army with a very similar system that has been highly successful in providing a variety of metallic nanopowders for defense applications over the past year. POC for this effort is Cathy Kallistros, ckallis@pica.army.mil.

	The second is the actual slot in the facility schedule, which could be of two classes, short turnaround time and normal.  
SHORT TURNAROUND TIME:  Mounting of the meter to be tested 
should begin within two weeks or less of the time of the initial official request and testing procedures at the facility should be completed with minimal delay (i.e. a good faith effort by the supplier to complete the testing schedule requested by the customer.  

NORMAL TURNAROUND TIME: The supplier provides scheduling for 
testing time in accordance with with their normal schedule and requires no particular measures to expedite the testing procedures.

2.  Paragraph 8 begins: Measurement uncertainty documentation for the flow measurement standards and facilities – both tiers.  The last sentence is hereby changed to read as follows:

On Tuesday, November 1, 2005, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors (Consultants) for the modernization of the Dr. A.H. McCoy Federal Building, in Jackson, Mississippi.  The Industry Day (Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session) will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in the 5th Floor Conference Room in the Dr. A.H. McCoy Federal Building, 100 West Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The modernization of the Dr. A. H. McCoy Federal Building, to be designed in metric units and American standard, will require at a minimum professionals in: architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for construction drawings, specifications, cost estimation, scheduling, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and construction administration services.  When the modernization is complete the building will meet current Federal Security and Energy goals, and will be LEED-certified.  The McCoy Building, constructed in 1979 in the Jackson Central Business District, is a multi-tenant professional office building, 15 stories in height including a basement.  It is approximately 422,600, gross square feet (gsf), approximately 383,600, rentable square feet (rsf), with 33 ground floor indoor parking spaces.  The Dr. A.H. McCoy Federal Building houses offices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, The Corporation for National and Community Service, The Defense Contract Audit Agency, The Department of Health and Human Services, The Department of Justice, The Department of Labor, The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, The Environmental Protection Agency, The U.S. Forest Service, The Department of Housing and Urban Development, The Internal Revenue Service, The Social Security Administration, The Department of the Treasury, and The U.S. General Services Administration.

This Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and to affirm its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the selected A/E firm for this project.  The A/E firm that is selected for this project (that is not a small business) will be required to perform at least 35% of the level of contract effort within the State of Mississippi.  In addition, prior to contract 
award, the selected firm will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan.  The minimum requirement in this plan will be to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum goals for the work that the selected firm subcontracts to other firms:  39% Small Business, which can be further broken down to include 6% Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 5%; Woman-Owned Small Businesses, 3% Hubzone Businesses, 3% Small Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses, and 22% Other Small Businesses.  

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with the prospective lead A/E firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.  Although it is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist the prospective lead A/E in identifying qualified subcontractors/consultants to meet the subcontracting goals established for this project, GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between potential Primes and Subcontractors.  Therefore, any contracts that may be entered into as a result of this Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Industry Day should be directed to either David Gibson, GSA’s, Public Buildings Service Small Business Advocate, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail: DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Dinora Gonzalez GSA’s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail: Dinora.Gonzalez@GSA.GOV.

     RSVP by October 31, 2005 via e-mail to Alex Smith at alex.smith@gsa.gov,  provide firm name, point of contact, contact number and number of attendees.  This information is for building security access.

<DESC><p>GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING SERVICES OPPORTUNITY - 
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>


<p>This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only! </p>

<p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is currently evaluating the functions related to its Sales and Agency Distribution Programs and is seeking alternative revenue sharing models that could be provided by the private sector.  GPO is interested in increasing public awareness of its products, enhancing customer access for broader dissemination, expanding distribution channels, and utilizing advanced technologies for the sale, production and distribution of print and tangible publications to the public.  GPO is requesting information to determine the types of innovative ideas that private vendors would utilize to provide some or all of the services for a sales and/or agency distribution program.  This information will be used to determine the best way to collaboratively structure the Sales and Agency Distribution Programs to enhance the sale and distribution of official tangible publications, to achieve cost reductions, and to move the official GPO brand into mainstream information dissemination channels. </p>

BACKGROUND: 

<p>The GPO is the Federal government’s primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms.  Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and government agencies a set of centralized services that enables them to easily and cost effectively produce printed documents.  In addition, GPO has offered these publications for sale to the general public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program. </p>

<p>Currently, the public can purchase items through the GPO by placing orders via telephone, fax, mail, the Online Bookstore (http://bookstore.gpo.gov/), by visiting the GPO Bookstore in Washington D.C., or through the Federal Citizens Information Center in Pueblo, CO (http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/).  Orders are shipped primarily through GPO’s distribution facilities in Laurel, MD and Pueblo, CO.  Some items are shipped from GPO’s bindery line and/or its contract printers. </p>

<p>Currently there are over 3,000 active publications with physical inventory available for sale through the GPO for an average price of $25.  Traditionally, the bulk of the copies for the sales inventory have been printed as part of an offset print run, though the Sales Program is moving away from maintaining a print inventory and towards a print-on-demand (POD) framework.  No inventory is kept for the POD publications as they are printed from press optimized pdf files once ordered by a customer.  A repository of print-on-demand masters is being created for all information products that fit the technological criteria of POD.  Implementation of POD has enabled GPO to increase its current publication title offerings by more than 1,600 additional titles.  By utilizing POD technology, GPO is able to greatly increase the number of titles available for sale each year, reduce physical inventory, reduce its distribution in print costs and keep an expanded list of titles indefinitely. </p>

<p>Publications available from GPO cover a broad range of subjects, anything from aviation to health care to education, and are classified using current BISAC Subject Headings.  Some of the bestselling publications have traditionally been The United States Government Manual, The Occupational Outlook Handbook, and The Constitution of the United States & The Declaration of Independence.  GPO also sells items in a variety of formats, including CD-ROMS, posters, pamphlets, microfiche, and maps.</p> 

<p>In addition, the GPO has over 200 subscriptions for sale.  In FY 2004, there were approximately 160,000 paid subscribers for these titles.  Subscriptions fall into one of three categories: dated periodicals, irregular subscriptions, and basics & supplements.  Dated periodicals are released on a regular frequency.  Irregular subscriptions consist of a set number of issues or volumes however there is no predetermined release schedule.  Basic & supplement subscribers will receive the basic volume and then will receive any supplements to it as they are published.  Some of the more popular subscriptions are the Code of Federal Regulations, FDA Consumer, and The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.</p> 

<p>Although some of the inventory items are printed in GPO facilities, the vast majority is procured by GPO from private printers throughout the United States.  The GPO prints or procures approximately 300,000 print jobs a year for its Federal agency customers.  As each job is ordered by an agency, an Information Specialist reviews the item to determine its potential for inclusion in the Sales Program based on whether it would be of interest to the public.  Traditionally, additional copies are printed for the Sales Program along with the agency’s order with the added advantage of incremental pricing.  Historically, approximately 1,200 new titles are selected for printing by the Sales Program each year; however, many more titles could be offered for sale utilizing the POD technology.</p> 

<p>Once printed, titles that are not directly distributed or set up for POD are sent to a GPO facility for warehousing and distribution. These facilities handle the fulfillment of orders coming in via telephone, fax, mail, and the Online Bookstore.  Distribution statistics for both the Laurel, MD, and Pueblo, CO, facilities can be found in Appendix A.</p> 

<p>In FY 2004, GPO’s Sales Program distributed nearly 4.5 million sales copies to its customers, primarily from the distribution facility in Laurel, MD.  About 23% of the orders received are for two or more individual titles.  In FY 2004, the Sales Program earned almost $25 million dollars in revenue.  Cost of goods sold was equal to 24.7% of this amount.</p> 

<p>In addition, GPO also performs distribution work for other agencies on a reimbursable basis as a part of its Agency Distribution Program.  GPO distributed almost 18 million copies in FY 2004 on a reimbursable basis.  The majority, close to 14.5 million, of the copies was distributed out of the facility in Pueblo.  A large portion of the work performed at Pueblo is on the behalf of GSA’s Federal Citizens Information Center and consists of pamphlet mailings.</p> 

<p>GPO markets to a wide variety of customers, many of whom are purchasing government information as a reference or guidance tool for the workplace.  These individuals are employed at a wide variety of places including libraries, government agencies, businesses, and law firms.  Consistent purchasers of government publications have been the public, academic, law, special, school, and government agency libraries that buy the GPO’s major subscription and serial publications. GPO has long standing relationships with a number of resellers. It also sells directly to private citizens.  Military history publications, national park books, and Senate art publications are among those that appeal to the retail market.</p> 

<p>OPPORTUNITY: </p>

<p>Operating as a Government agency, the GPO has been limited in its ability to aggressively promote its information products and services.  As information that had traditionally been produced in print has migrated to the Internet, the GPO has been slow to evolve and refine its services to meet the changing needs of the public.  In addition, GPO has not effectively participated in channels that would help increase visibility and distribution of its offerings to new markets, but is now producing and distributing ONIX records to increase awareness of the wide variety of publications that it offers.  Although less than five percent of current sales are to wholesale book dealers, GPO has recently expanded efforts to increase sales to wholesale markets using advance sales and volume discounts. GPO believes that there is a significant opportunity for increased revenue from sales to the general public and resellers with improved marketing and better use of available channels.</p> 

<p>It is no longer economically feasible for GPO to continue to operate its Sales and Agency Distribution Programs using its traditional methods.  Therefore, GPO is seeking alternative models for its Sales and Agency Distribution Programs that could be provided by innovative relationships with the private sector.  GPO is interested in increasing public awareness of its official tangible publications, enhancing customer access for broader dissemination, expanding distribution channels, and utilizing advanced technologies for the sale, production and distribution of print and tangible publications to the public, its traditional customers and resellers.  Ideally, the vendor establishing a relationship with the GPO would serve as the “Official Agent” of the GPO funded through revenue sharing.  GPO anticipates working with the vendor in some limited aspects and is open to ideas on how this relationship could be developed.  GPO could also coordinate the use of internal GPO or GPO contract printing to obtain the initial quantities that the vendor requires, as well as providing for the use of its repository of press optimized pdf files for POD production of publications.  Through innovative relationships with the private sector, the GPO hopes to achieve its core mission of “Keeping America Informed” more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p> 

<p>GPO is seeking an “Official Agent” to perform the duties of its Sales and/or Agency Distribution Programs and be the primary distributor for official, authentic government content on a revenue sharing basis.  Keeping GPO’s goals in mind, please outline how your organization would perform the services of a sales and/or agency distribution program.  Services may include but are not limited to the following: inventory acquisition and management, sales, marketing, order processing and fulfillment, customer support, storage, and distribution.</p> 

<p>Vendors are hereby requested to submit a statement by May 4, 2005 detailing the approach they would take to perform all or part of the services of a sales and/or agency distribution program.  Please include company points of contact, and GSA Schedule number (if applicable).  Special attention will be paid to the following key ideas in the responses:</p> 


<p>1.  How will you advance GPO's core mission of "Keeping America Informed" through your involvement as an "Official Agent" of the GPO? </p>
<p>2.  What are some innovative ideas you will implement to enhance the overall distribution of tangible government information?</p> 
<p>3.  Given the approaches that you've described above, what sort of contractual relationship do you anticipate having with GPO and what form of revenue sharing do you foresee? </p>
<p>4.  Why do you feel that your company is especially qualified for this Government Publishing Services Opportunity? </p>

<p>Prior to the release of any formal request for proposals (RFP), GPO will be conducting an informational meeting at its headquarters in Washington, DC.  GPO will extend invitations to those vendors who demonstrate the potential to make a positive contribution to the dialogue based on their response to this RFI. </p>
 
<p>This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate the GPO in any way.  This is not a request for proposal and the GPO will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. </p>

Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX) Automation

Posted:  15 Sep 05  Closing Date (Per Amendment 0002):  24 Oct 05/1700 Hours (5:00 pm) Baghdad Local Time 

The Joint Contracting Command – Iraq/Afghanistan has a requirement to select a System Integrator (Contractor) for the installation, implementation, and training of software and specification of hardware for the Iraq Stock Exchange (ISX) and the Depository (D).  This RFP includes the selection or procurement of software but excludes the procurement of hardware, other than providing specifications for the purchase of hardware for Government approval, which the Government will either provide to the Contractor or have the Contractor procure as an option line item.  The ISX is striving to re-establish its presence among Middle Eastern stock markets through the use of contemporary technology and superior service to brokers, listed companies, and investors alike.  Specifically, the provisions of the present law include graduation from the current manual trading floor of the ISX to an automated trading system; de-centralization of the trading function; de-materialization of traded securities through the permanent assignment of stock certificates in a Depository; establishment of a share registry to coordinate with the depository to expedite the settlement of trades to conform with international “best-practices”; and implementation of software that facilitates a trading, settlement, clearing, and depository system (the System).  The System should be able to handle both Arabic and Latin characters for input/output.  The ISX's goal is to establish an orderly, liquid, and efficient stock market by expediting securities settlements through de-materialization; minimizing settlement risks through a delivery-versus-payment protocol; instilling public and investor confidence through transparent pricing; reducing operating expense burdens by accommodating high trading volumes, reducing the impact of fixed costs through automation, and eliminating much of the paperwork of the current manual system; connecting the ISX with the Iraq Securities Commission (ISC), the Depository, and the Central Bank via the Wide Area Network (supplied by the Offeror) thereby facilitating effective oversight; and de-centralizing brokerage operations away from the trading floor via the Wide Area Network.

The Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO) is engaged on behalf of the Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX).  The essential components of the effort are: 1.) the delivery of a software package that meets all of the requirements set forth in this RFP of functionality for the ISX; 2..) the installation and implementation of electronic trading systems for the Iraq Stock Exchange; and 3.) an electronic Clearing, Settlement, and Depository system for a Depository facility.  Another essential component of this RFP will be: 4.) training and related deliverables for all involved staff at the ISX, the Depository (D), and others designated. Computer hardware to support the operation of the trading systems of the ISX and the clearing, settlement, and depository functions of the D will either be provided by the Government or purchased from the Contractor as an option.  This RFP establishes detailed business, operational, and technical requirements to be distributed to potential Contractors.  The ISX seeks to automate the securities market life cycle from the trade through to the settlement.  The Contractor selected under this RFP will be obligated to provide ten (10) essential services to the ISX:  Identify and deliver software for the automation of the ISX that meets all of the required functionality and specifications noted in this RFP;  Develop detailed specifications for the hardware to be used in automation that is best suited, both economically and technically, to the supplied software and deliver the hardware at the Government’s option;  Build a Wide Area Network for the operations of the ISX and the D;  Oversight and installation of a fully automated trading, clearing, and settlement system and the creation and installation of a depository system (all are to be referred to as the System);  Follow-up refinement of the newly installed System including making necessary and desired modifications for present users’ needs and configuration requirements, and to eliminate programming errors and procedural inefficiencies;  Utilizing the Wide Area Network provided by the Contractor, insure that the installation of the software and the hardware enable total connectivity with other key end-users including, but not limited to, the ISX, banks, the ISX Board of Governors (BOG), the Iraq Securities Commission (ISC), and other entities as identified; Utilizing the Wide Area Network provided by the Contractor, to insure that the installation of the software and the hardware enable confirmed trading transactions away from the ISX;  Up-grading of the skill-base of current and incoming ISX training staff and all users to effectively operate the advanced Systems and to provide inter-active data feeds to the ISC and other outside parties critical to the governance of Iraq’s capital markets; Review and modify as necessary the operating manuals (develop operations & maintenance and training manuals) to be provided to all the users of this System insuring that comprehensive manuals are provided that meet a wide variety of user’s needs and;  Provide a one month help desk for responsive and effective support for the required period after installation is complete; assisting the users with all issues that arise from the installed software.  Any interested party with advance knowledge of this Request for Proposal or who participated in the development of the requirement will be declared non-responsive.  Proposals will be evaluated using best value methods.  Further details are available in the RFP.  The RFP is available on http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net  Interested parties may go to that web-site, click on "New Solicitations", then click on "PCO Solicitations", then click on the RFP title "Iraqi Stock Exchange (ISX) Automation", then right-click on "W91GXQ-05-R-0009 RFP ISX AUTOMATION" (and the the RFP Amendments separately), select "Save Target As...", and then download the solicitation and save it.

<SOLNBR>NNA06127459L
<RESPDATE>110405
<ARCHDATE>10212006
<CONTACT>Michael J. Hutnik, Contracting Officer, Phone (650) 604-4195, Fax (650) 604-6990, Email Michael.J.Hutnik@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the completion of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Airborne System Development, Integration and Test (ASDIT) (completion of development) segment of the overall SOFIA program.  The purpose of this sources sought activity is to determine whether there is more than one entity interested in, and more importantly capable of, completing the SOFIA development within programmatic parameters.   It is anticipated that NASA shall issue a contract to complete the work for the SOFIA ASDIT segment of the overall SOFIA program as a sole source, as authorized under FAR 6.302-1 Only One responsible Source to L3 Communications, Waco, TX, the company that is currently performing the required modifications to the SOFIA aircraft.	L3 Communications was the subcontractor performing the modifications to the Aircraft Systems under contract NAS2-97001 issued to United Space Research Alliance. HISTORY The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) arrayed with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, as well as other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub-millimeter observations.  The SOFIA observatory is being developed by NASA and its partner the DLR (German Aerospace Center).  The SOFIA observatory will be the world’s largest and most sensitive airborne observatory.  The aircraft shall operate at a ceiling of 45,000 feet.  At stratospheric altitudes the telescope and its suite of scientific instruments can collect radiation with wavelengths of 0.3 micrometers to 1.6 millimeters.	The telescope shall peer out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft, and will allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before.  The astronomers, technicians, engineers and flight crews will work in a comfortable airliner environment during a typical eight to ten hour flight. The estimated life of the operational program is 20 years.	 In December 1996, NASA awarded a contract to the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) to serve as the prime contractor with overall responsibility for development if the SOFIA Airborne System, and the Science and Mission Operations as well as the deliver the first 10 years of science missions to collect and analyze data in the infrared (IR) spectrum.  Raytheon, (although later acquired by L3 Communications) was originally proposed by USRA as and was a major subcontractor under the USRA contract and is responsible for the design, development, test, integration and delivery of a structurally modified B747-SP.  The mid-nineties was a period in which “privatization” was widely espoused as a beneficial method for the Government to pursue and acquire its mission needs.  Central to the privatization model is a minimal involvement of the Government in either insight or oversight roles, deferring largely to the contractor to manage the program.   It became apparent as NASA moved deeper into the development phase, that SOFIA was even more complex in its requirements, namely the structural modifications, the integration of a large IR telescope provided by DLR, the NASA German partners, and the overhaul and airworthiness actions associated with the certification of the aircraft for flight.  The effect of the many challenges in these areas resulted in development schedule delays, thereby impacting the delivery of critical research data to the research community and increasing program cost.  These impacts resulted in a decision in May 2005, supported by several reviews of the SOFIA program, that it was critical that NASA restructure the program to enable the completion of development and the commencement of science data collection and analysis. CURRENT PROGRAM STATUS This project (SOFIA Airborne System development) is approximately 85% complete.  All major modification efforts on the aircraft have been designed, engineered and nearly completely installed.  Some ground testing has been accomplished.  Certain observatory unique subsystems, such as electronics equipment are still being developed for later installation.  The telescope assembly has been installed in the aircraft and has undergone basic operational testing.  The work remaining on the aircraft includes some development and completion of installations, but primarily entails systems integration and ground and flight performance testing. A more robust description of the work completed to date is attached (see the document entitled State of Completion of SOFIA Airborne System). The SOFIA program restructure addresses both internal government changes as well as a realignment of	the contractual relationships for the major SOFIA segments which include: 1) SOFIA ASDIT, to include all activities necessary to complete development and enable operational flight, 2) Science and Mission Operations, 3) Aircraft operations, and 4) Government integration.  In 1996, the SOFIA program was structured as a prime contractor/subcontractor arrangement, with USRA serving as the prime.  Under the restructure, the Government will enter into prime contracts for each segment and assume a larger role in the oversight of the overall SOFIA program.   This Sources Sought announcement addresses only the ASDIT portion of this restructure effort as USRA will continue to provide Science and Mission Operations Support and NASA will utilize an existing Agency-wide contract to provide Aircraft Operations services.  STATEMENT OF WORK The work to be accomplished under this procurement shall consist of the completion of the development of the SOFIA Airborne System.  The SOFIA Airborne System consists of the refurbished basic aircraft, a Boeing 747SP, and all modifications, additional systems, provisions and support equipment required to accommodate the Telescope Assembly, mission crew, science investigators, and the education and public outreach teams and meet the SOFIA Airborne System performance requirements.  A Statement of Work that describes the work to be accomplished is attached to this Sources Sought and is entitled, SOFIA Statement of Work. ELEMENTS OF WORK THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL NOTICE A Supplemental Type Certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration is required.  Any contractor interested must show an ability to obtain a Supplemental Type Certificate for modifying the aircraft from the FAA and must be capable of maintaining the Certificate for the operational life of the aircraft (approximately 20 years). After completion of  the ORR, the ASDIT, as the holder of the Supplemental Type Certificate, shall be responsible for providing NASA with continued data and engineering analysis.  L3 Communications is currently in the process of obtaining a Supplemental Certification from the FAA.  Should another contractor be selected to accomplish this work through a competitive procurement, it will be the responsibility of that contractor to obtain the appropriate certificate or have any certificate issued by the FAA transferred.  The ASDIT contractor shall prepare the aircraft and be responsible for the aircraft through the Operational Readiness Review (ORR).  The Operational Readiness Review will be complete when the SOFIA Airborne System performs as required in the SOFIA requirements documents as specified in Statement of Work section 2.0.2.1.  All systems provided by the contractor must perform as an integrated part of the SOFIA Observatory.  The aircraft shall be complete and ready for flight and operations. SCHEDULE: The current schedule requires a first flight (closed door) in October 2006.  Work described in the Statement of Work must be accomplished to meet this first flight schedule.  Any contractor interested in completing this work should provide information as to whether it can meet this schedule. The overall period of performance of the principle tasks required to complete development through ORR is approximately three years.  COST The Government estimate to complete this work is $40,000,000. The aircraft is currently located in Waco, TX at the L3 Communications facility.  The aircraft is non-operational.   NASA will consider the amount of duplication of work and costs that would be incurred by potentially changing contractors performing the work, an example includes the costs of relocating the aircraft from its present location to  another location.   CAPABILITY STATEMENT Interested contractors having the required specialized capabilities to meet this requirement should submit a capability statement indicating their interest and ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein as well as ability to perform the work required within the proposed schedule.	 Upon receipt of the information requested by this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government shall review the responses for contractor interest and capabilities.  Contractors that exhibit interest and have provided sufficient information as to their capability shall be contacted to request further information.   If after the publication of this Sources Sought, NASA receives either no responses, or the  responses and subsequent market survey indicate no other contractor is capable of meeting the requirements or that no economically feasible alternative exists, NASA shall proceed to issue this procurement as a sole source, as authorized under FAR 6.302-1 Only One Source, to L3 Communications, Waco, TX. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Please be advised this requirement is not considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Michael J. Hutnik III no later than 4 November 2005.  Please reference NNA06127459L in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION. 

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Large Bank Supervision (LBS) is investigating vendor interest and capability in configuring an integrated COTS product suite, developing interfaces to external systems, implementation of the solution, training, and maintenance support services to satisfy the following project mission statement.   “To develop a management and information solution that will improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness of the supervisory documents and reports, ensure appropriate approval process, automate document distribution and records management, and provide integrated business intelligence for report aggregation and executive reporting”.

The OCC LBS has the following business objectives that this solution must satisfy:
·	Improve the process of sharing vital LBS documents;
·	Utilize a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Document/Records Management system that will provide a centralized document storage repository, and manage the creation, access, and lifecycle of electronic documents;
·	Standardize the business processes related to the flow of electronic documents by defining and analyzing the current business processes;
·	Automate the repetitive business processes within the Large Banks using an automated workflow tool that tightly integrates with the DM solution.
·	Apply appropriate retention and disposition processes to stored electronic documents.

Responses to this RFI are due by 2:00 PM on October 28, 2005.  It is anticipated that the acquisition will be conducted as an order against a GSA schedule contract.  See Section 3.0 for further information on the information to be included with the vendor response.


2.0	GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS. 
 
The document management solution will consist of five major features: Document repository, document management functionalities, business process automation functionality, business intelligence capabilities, and seamless transition of documents to agency official records.  It is envisioned that the solution will allow the capability to bring together the five major features into a personalized web top, for each individual user, to allow for ease of use in a user centric workspace. 

The document repository feature will provide a centralized location, for all Large Bank staff/examiners, where documents can be store and retrieve using standard document metadata.  
Document management functionalities will enable users to apply security to each document, track the processing of each document, create versions of their document, and to easily search for stored documents.
The business process automation function will automate the LBS business processes that produce documents.  Document templates and their processing will be an integral part of the workflow automation.  This function will also seamlessly integrate with the DM solution and will have a bi-directional interface to the Supervisory Information solution (SIS) Large Bank (LB) application for transfer/updating of discrete data between document templates and SIS LB database.
The business intelligence capability will allow for the presentation of both structured and unstructured data in a personalized and interactive manner; resulting in the display of various comprehensive aggregated data sets in the forms of live reports, charts, tables, pivot tables, graphs, and ticklers.  
A seamless transition of documents to agency official records function will provide the users with the ability to create official records with no user interaction to the agency records management solution.

System Capabilities

The following are the system capabilities that LBS is envisioning for the solution:

System shall provide a centralized document repository for all LB documents.
The purpose of this system capability is to provide a centralized document storage or repository for all documents as part of an Enterprise repository.  The document management solution will be designed to enable all users from 24 geographical locations to access the interface, add documents, and save them to a centralized location that can be viewed and accessed by all other users within their security parameters.  

System shall provide electronic document management capabilities to LBS staff.
The purpose of this system capability is to provide all required document management capabilities.  Note:  OCC has purchased the Hummingbird DM (and RM) software to satisfy this requirement, however, the hardware architecture and installation/configuration of this software is part of the activities of the DM solution described in this RFI. 
 
System shall improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness of supervisory reports.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution improves the quality, consistency and timeliness of supervisory reports.  

System shall provide an automated process for ensuring appropriate approvals and distributions of the LB documents through defined business processes.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that an automated workflow tool is integrated seamlessly with the Hummingbird (HB) Document Management (DM) software.  This automated workflow tool must have the capability to: seamlessly interface with HB DM; have serial/parallel routing paths; provide e-mail notifications; an API interface to relational databases; allow users to initiate a workflow process from a selection list; allow users to create assignment lists and sub-route an item to other users; enable authorized workflow users to create assignment templates; provide users with the ability to add, delete, and modify documents to workflow items based on their permission parameters; provide users with the ability to perform document collaboration on the documents in the business processes; and have ad-hoc routing capabilities to satisfy the various business processes that are not routine.  

System shall provide information and report aggregation capabilities.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution provides an aggregation function for the reports and information stored in the solution.  

System shall provide a seamless transition of documents to agency records. 
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the DM solution can seamlessly transition or transfer a working document to the electronic records management system (Hummingbird).

System shall comply with the OCC Enterprise Architecture requirements and standards. 
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution complies with the OCC Enterprise Architecture (EA) requirements and standards.  

System shall comply with the OCC Statutory and Legislative compliance requirements. 
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution complies with the Statutory and Legislative requirements outlined in this document.  These requirements include the Section 508 compliance, Records Management requirements, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and Privacy Act requirements. 

System shall provide a Standard LB Operating Procedure (SOP).
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that upon deployment of the solution, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is provided to the users.  The SOP defines the operating procedures and guidelines that are not part of the automated workflow or the document management capability.  These are rules and guidelines to help guide the users on making day-to-day business decisions on document storage, deletion, workflow process, and document templates.  

System shall provide a Standard LB Security Procedure (SSP). 
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that upon deployment of the solution, a Standard Security Procedure (SSP) is provided to the users.  The SSP defines the security procedures and guidelines.  These procedures will enable the users to comply with the security requirements set forth for the solution.  

System shall provide a standard LB naming convention procedures for metadata and documents.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that a standard naming convention for naming documents in the DM repository is followed by the users.  The naming convention applies to all document names and metadata elements that require the user’s input.  This requirement ensures that all users are aware of the type of information that can be imported and stored in the DM repository and it also eliminates the duplication of documents by different users.

System shall have standard metadata taxonomy for the definition of bank supervision data.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution provides standard metadata around unstructured bank supervision data to be incorporated into the OCC taxonomy. 

System shall provide a standard template for core LB document types.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution stores and provides standard document templates.  The document templates will be stored in the DM repository with a standard naming convention so that all users can identify the document. These document templates will have the required security permissions and parameters.  			
System shall include a Business Intelligence utility for analytical data charts and graphs reporting.
The purpose of this capability is to provide the LB mangers with specific dashboard functionality.  The dashboard content shall be generated based on the user’s role and identity.  The dashboard utility must include live reports, prompts, charts, tables, pivot tables, graphics, and tickers based on the data stored in the database.  The dashboard utility must be interactive and enable its users to drill down, navigate, modify, and interact with the data results.  The dashboard utility will also be comprehensive where the content is aggregated from a wide variety of sources, including the Internet, shared file servers, relational databases, and the document management repository data.

System shall include new and existing LB documents in the centralized repository. 
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the previously created documents by the LB users are migrated to the DM repository.  

System shall support a role-based permission structure to securely store LB documents.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution utilizes a role-based structure defined by LBS to secure solution access.  The solution will be structured to have a hierarchical permission security. 

System shall enable users to work on documents outside the solution and import the end result back in the solution.
The purpose of this system capability is to ensure that the solution provides users with the ability to work on their documents outside the solution.  This process would enable a user to export a copy of their document from the solution and work on the document while off-line.  Exporting the document form the repository would require the user to lock the document and disable other users from modifying it.  Once the document is completed, it is imported back into the solution and available to all other users within their permission parameters.

Information for the effort is as follows:

I.  Overview of the RFI Process

All locations will automatically report trouble alerts to a manned security post at the main complex.  The ability to include voice alerts with this system is required (public address override and pre-recorded messages).  Due to the nature of the campus and the training occurring on the various properties, the ability to provide notification to personnel outside of the buildings is necessary.  The ability for expansion of the system to include an additional five training buildings and five lodging buildings is required. The contractor will provide all necessary tools, test equipment and materials to allow CDP  to run full operation and maintenance of the system.  The contractor will maximize the use of state-of-the-art equipment.

Please submit a capabilities statement indicating your interest and ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.

Include a description of the services provided, the period of performance, a point of contact - name, phone number, address and e-mail of the contracting officer and technical representative.  

The Government will evaluate the information provided and use it to document our market research.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS A PARTNERSHIP TO CONTINUE ONGOING COLLABORATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CANCER PROBE DIAGNOSTIC SOFTWARE
       
Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking an industrial partner with a demonstrated cancer detection probe to participate in a cooperative research and development (CRADA) project under the Department of Energy’s Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program 
(See http://ipp.nn.doe.gov/) (For a description of LLNL’s IPP programs, see www.llnl.gov/str/Dunlop2.html).

Biofil’s role would be to further improve data analysis and diagnostic software developed at Biofil using the prospective industrial partner’s own breast cancer probe. 

Over the next two years, the industrial partner will link the development of its own working cancer detection probe to the development of Biofil’s data analysis software. The industrial partner and BioFil will use the industrial partner’s probe to develop software algorithms to determine tissue type and state, based on the collected patient data. Initially the work will involve developing improved models for the probe and the individual sensor measurements. The industrial partner will collaborate with BioFil to explore other medical applications (e.g. prostate cancer) and to evaluate new sensor options that could improve accuracy. 

Interested industrial partners must be able to provide the scientists, engineers and programmers and financial resources required for this project.  In order to integrate with the ongoing data analysis development at Biofil, the industrial partner must have a probe capable of measuring the optical and electrical properties of the tissue near the tip of the needle over a broad spectral and frequency range at data rates of up to 100 times per second. The probe must be capable of measuring multiple parameters in real time, simultaneously, including blood concentrations, oxy-deoxyhemoglobin fractions, tissue and cellular structure, and tissue and molecular composition. The measurements must be made both in normal and suspicious tissue. 

This partnership will be part of the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program. The IPP program requires that the partners become members of the United States Industrial Coalition (USIC).The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or non-exclusive licensing agreements, as determined by the IPP program. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.




Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in partnering with LLNL and the Russian Institution, Biofil, to develop and commercialize breast cancer probe diagnostic software should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to the requirements specified above, within fourteen (14) days from the date this announcement is published, to:

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information (RFI) for Joint Biological Warfare (BW) Medical Diagnostic Equipment Roadmap Study Effort, in support of the DoD Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Program.
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) is requesting information to survey both available and emerging technologies or retrospective analytical systems that may be incor portated into a military detection and diagnostic system to meet the needs of all U.S. DoD military services as part of the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Program.  This RFI is specifically seeking information on techn ologies that may support pre-planned product improvement and delivery of a Block III version of the JBAIDS system.  Information gathered in response to this RFI will be used to support the JPEO-CBD and JBAIDS program office in strategic planning for develo pment of a Block III acquisition strategy.  The Block I JBAIDS system has successfully been developed to Government specification with fielding initiated in 2005.  Block I capabilities include assays for 16 targets representing 14 different pathogens that have demonstrated greater than 90% sensitivity at the 90% confidence level in a variety of both environmental and clinical matrices with specificity greater than 90% against genetic near neighbors.  Block II JBAIDS adds analytical capabilities supporting i dentification of toxins; no specification currently exists for the Block II device.  For the Block III effort, the potential technology solution may not be limited to conventional and/or previously fielded detection strategies; systems utilizing mas spectr ometry, terahertz detection, and other emerging approaches are examples of technologies under consideration.  A detailed system specification is beyond the scope of this RFI and only the fundamental technology needs will be highlighted within this notice.  The desired Block III JBAIDS system will perform simultaneous identification of multiple toxins and pathogens in both clinical and environmental samples with specificity of greater than or equal to 95% and achieve levels of threat agent detection (sensiti vity) with high fidelity and statistically supported confidence.  Capability is desired to test both clinical specimens and environmental samples for a broad spectrum (e.g. n=50) of high regret pathogens.  Manufacturing of this device and associated assays  must be GMP compliant, as Block III JBAIDS will be required to obtain FDA approval as a clinical diagnostic device prior to fielding.  Minimal logistics and personnel support is desired for operation of the Block III JBAIDS system.  Capability of the syst em to operate using minimal or no fluidics or reagent-less systems are highly desirable.  Sample preparation must be automated and integrated within the device.  The system must be able to be successfully operated by personnel with limited training and tec hnical skill sets.  The final design must be hand-held, easily transportable, ruggedized, and be of minimal weight.  The system must have onboard software that is capable of device operation, output analysis, and information transfer using conventional met hods (such as ethernet or serial communication) which can interface with existing DoD medical/information reporting systems.  In contrast to prior efforts under the JBAIDS program, candidates with technologies/systems under development in the prototype sta ge and early developmental efforts will be considered.  The desired development timeframe would be for the system to achieve technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 or higher to support program initiation and specified military testing along with initiation of supporting FDA trials in 3-5 years.  However, information on the level of development achievable at both the 3 year and 5 year timeframe is desired.  JPEO-CBD definitions for TRLs are available upon written request as noted below.  The following informa tion is requested from prospective companies electing to respond to the RFI:  1) Notification in writing to the Government Point of Contact (POC), and 2) Addres s in writing the company's ability to develop the proposed JBAIDS Block III system addressing the fundamental technology needs for the system as outlined above.  Candidates interested in this RFI are asked to use a quad chart (available upon request), as a  template for initial responses back to the Government.  Candidates are encouraged to additionally provide brief technology developmental plans for how the proposed Block III system can be developed to 1) eliminate the need for a specialized technician for  operation, 2) integration of sample preparation and detection into singular device, and 3) miniaturization of the device to accommodate a handheld format.  Plans should address strategic partnerships or cooperative research and developmental areas the can didate technology may leverage in the developmental process.  The Government may request meetings with the candidates to provide more in depth technical briefings as necessary to complete the survey.  Responses to the RFI will be accpeted for review if rec eived by 4:00pm EST on 14 November 2005.  Responding companies also need to state their company is eligible to receive a DoD Secret-Level Clearance.  Companies desiring to respond to this RFI should contact the Government POC, Ms. Kristin Korte for a copy of the JPEO-CBD Assigning Technologies Readiness Levels reference document and the summary quad chart.  Ms. Korte's contact information is as follows:  email kristin.korte@jpeocbd.osd.mil, phone (703)681-0813, and mailing address: JPEO-CBD, Attn Ms. Kristi n Korte, 5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite 1609, Skyline 2, Falls Church VA 22041.  The JPEO-CBD referenced material will be emailed to requesting companies.  Written responses to this RFI should be forwarded to Ms. Korte via email and hardcopy to the above mentio ned mailing address.  The above technical material responses from contractors will be used in developing a DoD Biological Warfare (BW) medical diagnostic equipment roadmap for future DoD investment strategies.  This RFI is issued soley for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are soley responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil/)

52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2004)  Addendum to 52.212-1(c): Quotes must be good for a minimum of 90 days.

52.212-2 EVALUATION –COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government will select the best overall offer based on a comparative assessment of Price and Past Performance, whereby price may be traded off for past performance.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance (3) Price:  ADDENDUM to 52.212-2:  Evaluation Process:  General Information:  All offers received will be subject to an evaluation by a team that includes government personnel experienced in aerobics instruction services.  The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government- price, and other factors considered.  However, if an offeror does not have relevant past performance history, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral, unknown, confidence rating.  In addition, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror and may be made without conducting discussions.  Consequently, offers, which do not conform to all the terms and conditions of this solicitation, may be considered unacceptable.  Technical Competency:  In order to be rated as acceptable.  Therefore, to be considered, an offeror must provide all the information and/or requirements listed below.  Failure to submit the listed requirements will result in the offeror’s technical aspect of the offer to be determined technically unacceptable.  Evaluation Criteria:  Contractor shall have all the certifications as stated in the Statement of Work, with at least two years experience.  Past Performance Evaluation:  A minimum of 2 or 3 most recent Contracts performed by the offeror, similar in nature and magnitude to the work described in the SOW, either governmental or private/commercial entities.  The offeror will provide all the relevant information to enable the evaluation team to give the following ratings.  Exceptional- Indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are clearly superior to that which would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror’s past performance record is so fundamentally sound that there is no doubt of the offeror’s ability to perform the requirement.  Very Good Indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are above industry standards that would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  Satisfactory/Neutral  Based on the offeror’s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or no past performance record is available.  Marginal Indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are below industry standards than would normally found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror’s past performance record presents significant doubt in the offeror’s ability to perform the requirement hence indicating a medium level of performance risk.  Unsatisfactory indicates that the offeror’s qualifications are clearly inferior to that which would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror’s past performance record is so fundamentally flawed that there is no doubt in the offeror’s inability to perform the requirement indicating a high level of performance risk.  Price Evaluation Factor:  For award purposes, the offeror will be evaluated on the total price of all CLINS contained in the Schedule.  All offers must include prices for all line items. Failure to include all prices will exclude the offer from further consideration for award.  Evaluation Procedures:  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government.  Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of each offer in terms of Technical Competency, Past Performance and Price.  Therefore, subjective judgment by the Government is implicit in the evaluation process.

Description:  (i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
(ii) This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP), GST0306R0001. 
(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05. 
(iv) This is a full and open procurement under NAICS 517110, “Wired Telecommunications Carriers”.  The Small Business Size Standard is 1,500 employees.  
(v) There are 16 contract line item numbers (CLINs).  Eighteen (18) existing in-place ISDN-PRI services with 5,250 existing DID numbers and, three (3) local T-1 tie lines will be transitioned to this contract. The Offeror will be responsible for porting the existing DID station line numbers to this contract.  Local Number Portability (LNP) via Remote Call Forwarding will not meet the reuse requirement.  The existing ISDN-PRI services and T-1 tie trunks terminate in 8 PBXs owned by GSA-FTS and other Government agencies (See Attachment 1).  Offeror's premises equipment, features, maintenance, and coverage shall be at least equal to that provided to the Offeror's commercial customers.  The ISDN-PRI local exchange services must be configured to enable Government users to access the Pittsburgh local and suburban exchange areas, intra-LATA toll areas, inter-LATA areas and, toll-free numbers (800, 888, etc.).  Access to the local exchange shall include TTY Relay and Emergency 911 services.  Offerors shall provide access to operator assisted services. Offerors must provide access to local and long distance directory assistance, e.g., NPA-555-1212. Offerors are responsible for the issuance of telephone directory orders, as necessary, for additions, removals and changes to the Federal Government listings in the blue pages of the local Verizon printed telephone directories.  The Offeror’s ISDN-PRI serving central office(s) must be located within the geographical boundaries of the City of Pittsburgh and/or Allegheny County, PA.  In their proposals, Offerors must provide both the addresses and types of central offices (e.g., AT&T 5ESS, Nortel DMS 100, etc.) to be used for the provisioning of the proposed ISDN-PRI service. 
The Government reserves the right to order future ISDN-PRI services, under this contract, at Government agency addresses within the geographical boundaries of the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, PA.  Any future services required under the resultant contract shall be priced no higher than the contract pricing for current locations; and will be incorporated through the negotiation of a contract modification.  However, there is no Government forecast for ISDN-PRI service requirements in these areas for the period of this contract.  

(vi) The Offeror shall appoint a Project Manager responsible for project management and coordination of ISDN-PRI implementations. The Project Manager shall be the Government’s prime point of contact for the duration of each implementation and for 30 days following each implementation.  After the 3rd successful business day following an implementation, the Project Manager shall provide a toll-free telephone number to receive trouble and maintenance calls from the Government and the Government’s PBX vendors.  Project Management for each transition includes the presence of the Offeror’s qualified technician on the premises of the Government’s PBX site and, qualified central office technician(s) for central office programming and testing until the implementation is completed.  The transitions will occur after normal business hours.  The Project Manager is responsible for the coordination of activities with the Government’s PBX contractors and, the incumbent local exchange carriers (i.e., AT&T and X/O) for each implementation.  This includes direct telephone and email communications with the PBX contractor’s on-site technicians and the PBX contractor’s remote test center technicians.  There are several PBX contractors.

<DESC>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT
ISSUES SOLICITATION FOR “REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS” (RFQ) FROM DEVELOPERS &/OR TEAMS FOR DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF
“ANACOSTIA GATEWAY GOVERNMENT CENTER” (AGGC)
LOCATED IN ANACOSTIA, WASHINGTON, DC


RFQ NO. POAM-2005-Q-0008-RS:	The District of Columbia government (District) is issuing a solicitation for development, design, construction and initial management of an office building to serve as the new headquarters for the District of Columbia government’s Department of Transportation (DDOT) on a site owned by the District, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, Good Hope Road and 13th Street, SE, in Washington, DC.  The project, referred to as the Anacostia Gateway Government Center (AGGC), will include 335,270 gross square feet of above grade office space on six (6) levels, 177,800 gross square feet of below grade parking for approximately 436 spaces and 14,835 useable square feet of below grade office space. The building must meet the LEED Silver Certification rating as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council. The District’s Zoning Commission has given the approval to a C-3-A PUD designation and zoning map amendment for the AGGC project.  

The District will consider development of the AGGC site either with District provided financing or with developer provided financing.  If the District chooses to provide financing for the AGGC site, it will grant a ground lease to a trustee with a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years.  The trustee will concurrently lease back to the District the ground and improvements to be constructed on the ground pursuant to a lease for a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years (the “Master Lease”).  The trustee will sell Certificates of Participation (“COPS”) in the Master Lease payments in an amount sufficient to fund the cost of development of the AGGC site.  Funds realized from the sale of the COPS will be used by the District to pay a developer for development of the AGGC site pursuant to an agreement(s) to be entered into between the developer and the District.  Alternatively, the District may consider developer provided financing for the AGGC site through any means that utilizes Master Lease payments by the District as the sole source of re-payment of the financing.         

At least thirty-five percent (35%) of the work for the AGGC development must be performed by the entities that are certified as either Small or Disadvantaged Business Enterprises by the OLBD.  The developer should note that the District’s LSDBE laws were recently amended and that the regulations and contractual clauses are being rewritten by the cognizant agencies.  In addition, the District’s E.E.O. Policies, Davis-Bacon Act (for construction work) and  Service Contract Act of 1965 (for  services activities) shall apply.           

The District will consider responses to this RFQ and evaluate the quality and capabilities of proposed developers and their team members in accordance with the factors set forth in the RFQ package.  The District is not seeking site development proposals in response to this RFQ.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Structures Division (Code 4.3.3), at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD has a requirement to procure engineering services from the Boeing Company for Reconfigurable Rotor Blades (RRB) development.  This effort will develop, demonstrate in a ¼-scale wind tunnel test actuation and full-scale engineering specimen bench test, and transition an in-flight, spanwise twist reconfigurable rotor blade for tilt-rotor aircraft like the V-22.  The goal of the effort is to better optimize the vehicle’s performance for the two different flight regimes of hover and cruise. This is a notice of intent to request a proposal from and negotiate with the Boeing Company, Philadelphia, PA on a sole source basis.  The Boeing Company has been identified as the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government’s requirement since they are the original developers of the twist reconfigurable rotor blade concept and own specific proprietary data rights to these technologies.  It is anticipated that this will be a cost plus fixed fee contract with a period of performance from December 2005 through March 2008.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to jody.reynolds@navy.mil by 4:00 EST 05 NOV 2005.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The DM team will explore particular opportunities in each of the countries in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region, including ways to assist with past USTDA-supported projects that may require additional assistance to move toward project implementation.  It is important that these projects are addressed through a regional DM as many of the projects must be considered with respect to the other prospective, and sometimes competing, transportation corridor projects.  The Contractor will be required to work closely with regional organizations and programs including SADC, the Southern African Railways Association, the Southern Africa Trade Hub, and the World Bank’s Sub-Saharan Africa Transportation Policy Program.

Botswana
Botswana is a landlocked country, a fact that has significantly hampered its economic growth despite being a model of macroeconomic and fiscal management for the region.  Botswana Railways has requested feasibility study assistance for two projects:  (1) an extension of the railway north to Zambia through Kazungula in order to establish a direct link with Zambia and its mineral export business; and (2) an extension of the railway from Lobatse to Namibia to create a direct rail connection with Walvis Bay and gain direct access to a port.  

Malawi
Malawi is also a landlocked country lacking effective transportation routes to link it with regional and international trade.  There are several projects which have been considered and for which the Government of Malawi is requesting assistance from USTDA:  (1) improved port infrastructure to develop transportation routes along Lake Malawi, which traverses most of the country; (2) the development of a transportation corridor along the Shire and Zambezi river waterway through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean.  This waterway was a major transportation corridor during colonial times and several preliminary studies have been undertaken to determine the technical viability of the project at this time; and (3) a rail connection from the Cahora Bassa dam area in Mozambique through Malawi, connecting to the rail line in Mozamique which finishes at the port of Nacala.

Mozambique
Mozambique is critical to several of the transportation corridors, including those from Malawi and from South Africa.  Several rail projects are currently being developed in Mozambique.  A consortium led by Pittsburgh-based Railroad Development Corp. has begun operating a company that will head the rehabilitation of Mozambique's Nacala Port and Railway to create the first regional integrated port/railway transportation system for Northern Mozambique that connects the land-locked country of Malawi with the Indian Ocean.  

The Maputo Development Corridor is a transportation corridor under development between the governments of South Africa and Mozambique to unlock the landlocked regions of Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo Province.  Comprising road, rail, border posts, port and terminal facilities, the Corridor runs through the most highly industrialized and productive regions of Southern Africa.  Johannesburg and Pretoria are on the western end of the Corridor’s axis with large concentrations of manufacturing, processing, mining and smelting industries. The corridor passes through vast industrial and primary production areas containing steel mills, petrochemical plants, quarries, mines, and smelters, through plantations of forests, sugar cane, bananas and citrus to the eastern end of Mozambique.  USTDA has been in discussions with the Maputo Corridor Logistics Initiative (MCLI), a group of infrastructure investors, service providers and users, focused on the promotion and further development of the Maputo Corridor, regarding areas for USTDA technical assistance, including a one-stop border post versus the complex and inefficient system currently used.

Namibia
Namibia is intent on becoming an important alternate major shipping point for Southern Africa.  Currently Namibia’s railways are disconnected from the rest of the region or in a state of disrepair.  USTDA has funded a feasibility study for a rail extension to the North of the country, the Tsumeb-Oshakati Railroad Extension project.  That project is currently being implemented.  However, no U.S. exports have been identified.  One of the potential exports for the project was for additional locomotives, but GE lost out on the bid for new locomotives to a Chinese manufacturer.  However, GE is still working to negotiate a locomotive rehabilitation deal with TransNamib, the Namibian state owned rail company.  

USTDA has also funded Technical Assistance (TA) and an Orientation Visit for the Trans Kalahari Corridor project to develop a multimodal transportation route between the port at Walvis Bay in Namibia and Gauteng Province in South Africa.   TERA is performing the study.  The project is moving forward, with the recent selection of an operations/management company to manage the corridor.  It is expected that there will be U.S. exports with the implementation of the project.  The project sponsor has requested follow on assistance to the current TA.  The DM team would evaluate this request.

In recent discussions with USTDA, TransNamib has requested assistance with several projects:  (1) a combination of a rail extension and rail rehabilitation for a line from the Sishen iron ore mine in South Africa to the Port of Luderitz in Namibia.  Sishen has been increasing output but has been struggling with South Africa’s transport utility, Transnet, to increase rail capacity to South African ports; (2) an extension through the northwestern Trans-Caprivi Corridor linking Namibia with Zambia.  This would allow an alternative route for the significant minerals exports from Zambia, which are currently exported through an inefficient port in Dar es Salaam or through Zimbabwe and South Africa; and (3) an extension to connect with Botswana and to Gauteng province.

South Africa
South Africa is the dominant economic power in the region and has the most well developed rail and transport systems.  South Africa accounts for about 47% of the total number of locomotives in Sub-Saharan Africa, 74% of the Sub-Saharan freight wagon fleet and 91% of Sub-Saharan rail freight traffic.
USTDA is currently supporting a GE bid for a Locomotive Upgrade and Maintenance project with a Training Grant offer to Spoornet, the South African rail company.  USTDA also funded the Integrated Rail Freight project with CSX for the transport of freight between Gauteng and Durban. 

South Africa has recently embarked upon a strategy to reach the desired GDP growth rate of 6% by investing in infrastructure projects.  A major focus of this investment will be addressing transportation logistic bottlenecks.  As such, there will likely be projects that would be appropriate for USTDA funding.  One concept which has been discussed is the implementation of a railcar leasing system similar to the system used in the U.S., in order to increase overall capacity.  Of course, South Africa plays a critical role in many of the regional transportation corridors as well.

Zambia
Zambia is a major minerals exporter for the region.  Currently much of the cargo is transported through Dar es Salaam, which has an inefficient port infrastructure, or through Zimbabwe to South African ports.  USTDA has received a proposal for a rail extension from Chingola to Solwezi and through to Angola.  The proposal is from the North West Rail Company Ltd. (NWRC).  NWRC has a concession agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe to develop this project.  Preliminary analysis shows the project to be viable and the U.S. Embassy has recommended USTDA review of the project.

USTDA has funded a rail extension project in Zambia for the Chipata Rail Extension project.  The project was not shown to be commercially viable, however the Government of Zambia has decided to implement the project with necessary subsidies.  The U.S. company, Edlow Resources Limited has entered into an MOU with the Ministry of Finance of Zambia for the development of this project.

Other
There are several other major corridors in the region, including the Dar es Salaam Corridor and the North-South Corridor connecting South Africa, Botswana, Angola, and the Dem. Rep. of Congo which should be considered.  The Contractor will be required to recommend a strategy for USTDA in this sector in the region.  The Contractor will be expected to identify and recommend at least three projects for immediate USTDA funding.  The Contractor will be expected to identify medium and long term opportunities for USTDA funding as well.  

There are a number of conceptual proposals for improving the efficiency and capacity of railways operations in the region.  These projects involve implementing alternative financing mechanisms, leasing arrangements for rolling stock, IT systems, and satellite based tracking systems.   The consultant will be required to research, identify, evaluate, and make recommendations for such projects to USTDA.

When proposing the strategy for the DM the Consultant should propose which countries will be visited as well as describe how the Consultant will evaluate these projects at a regional level.  We also welcome any other ideas about possible opportunities in this area that are not discussed above.




Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.

Annex VI

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

•	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

•	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

•	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

•	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

•	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

•	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.
