<DESC>The purpose of this Expression of Interest (EOI) is to obtain a listing of subcontractors interested in qualifying, bidding, and potentially supplying Self-Contained Air Conditioning Units for the MFFF HVAC system.  

Proposals will be solicited from qualified bidders by Request for Proposal (RFP) for an award to a single subcontractor to supply these components to MOX Services as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) below.

Interested suppliers in this procurement/scope of work should provide the following information to the listed point of contact:
 
1. Company information including company name and address and
   point of contact with phone number and e-mail address, 
2. A brief description of experience and capabilities with 
   regard to supplying this equipment, including applicable
   years of experience in providing this or like equipment. 
3. A summary statement to describe the prospective supplier's
   Quality Program/Plan with regard to meeting requirements of
   ASME NQA-1 w/ 1995 Addendum and/or 10CFR50, Appendix B.
4. Any additional information, facts, data relevant to the
   stated SOW.


Statement of Work (SOW):

This SOW includes all the labor, equipment, materials, and transportation required to fabricate the following equipment:

* Self-Contained Air Conditioning Units.

These items will be off-loaded, stored, and installed by others.  

A significant portion of this equipment will be Quality Level 1, an Item Relied on for Safety (or IROFS). Subcontractors that wish to submit proposals must have the appropriate NQA-1 Quality Assurance Program for the work (e.g. procurement, fabrication, packaging and shipping of materials/equipment).  

This equipment also requires qualification and evaluation to withstand the effects of a seismic event (Design Basis Earthquake) and must maintain its function before, during, and after an event. This requires design and analysis by a Professional Engineer and an appropriate NQA-1 Quality Assurance Program. The supplier may complete this analysis/qualification via performance testing and certification by a qualified independent laboratory.

Some equipment is designated as Quality Level 4, which is comparable to commercially available products. For the Self-Contained Units, they do not have to maintain function during or after a seismic event. The Computer Room A/C units must be analyzed to confirm the equipment cannot fail (during an earthquake) in a manner that could damage nearby equipment and that fluid pressure boundary integrity is maintained. The supplier will be requested to prepare and submit a Seismic Qualification Plan, with engineering oversight and final stamping of the report by a licensed professional engineer.

Unit testing (leak test, performance test, and functional test) will be performed per specified requirements.  

The RFP is scheduled to be sent out in the second or third quarter of fiscal year 2009, with a response due 60 days after issuance. Initial delivery requirement to be on site in July 2010.

Description of Equipment

SCAC Units: Quality Level 1
Units will be self-contained, factory-assembled and wired, and include cabinet, compressor, evaporator fan, evaporator coil, air filters, and controls with an integral air-cooled condenser. Quality Level 1 SCAC Units (15-Ton Average Capacity) scope includes 8 units.

SCAC Units: Quality Level 4
Units will be self-contained, factory-assembled and wired, and include cabinet, compressor, evaporator fan, evaporator coil, air filters, and controls with an integral air-cooled condenser. Quality Level 4 SCAC Units (15-Ton Average Capacity) scope includes 5 units. (These are commercial units-no analysis required)

CRAC Units: Quality Level 4
Each Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) unit will be a self-contained, factory-assembled and -wired unit consisting of cabinet, compressor, evaporator fan, evaporator coil, air filters, and controls, and fully charged with refrigerant and oil with an integral air-cooled condenser. Each unit shall include  microprocessor control system with continuous monitoring with system display (back-lit panel). 
**These are commercial units requiring analysis to ensure the failure of the units does not damage nearby equipment, as denoted in the Statement of Work above.**

* EOI responses required via email by 28-Feb-2008

<DESC>Introduction:
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for the development of therapeutic agents for select biodefense pathogens.
Description: 
Through this solicitation, the NIAID, is seeking to support projects to advance the development of promising candidate therapeutics with demonstrated in vivo activity against one or more of the following NIAID biodefense priority pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Variola major, Filoviruses: Marburg and Ebola, Influenza, Gram negative biodefense bacteria.  Note: NIAID seeks to support the development of broad spectrum antimicrobials with activity against more than one NIAID Category A, B, or C priority biodefense Gram negative pathogen, (e.g. Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, Rickettsia prowazeki, Coxiella burnetti, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni). Antimicrobial resistant pathogens were recently added to the NIAID Category C priority biodefense pathogens list and are defined as pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents.  Broad spectrum Gram negative candidate therapeutic agents proposed for advancement under this program should have demonstrated in vivo activity against at least one Gram negative Category A, B, or C pathogen; AND in vitro activity against at least three different genera of Gram negative Category A, B, or C pathogens.

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is, at a minimum, within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial. Support will be provided for non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies. The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity and that are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will not support: The design and conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials, the development of vaccines (vaccine is defined as an intervention that directly elicits a pathogen specific immune response), and the development of polyclonal antibody blood-derived products.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about July 31, 2008.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 5 ? 8.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about July 11, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Description:

The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) will produce completed Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies for use in domestic, commercial nuclear power reactors. The MFFF design for the United States will be licensed by the NRC, ensuring compliance with the most stringent design standards.  The NRC's regulations are found in Chapter I of Title 10, "Energy," of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  10 CFR 50 - Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants, will be applicable to this procurement.

The MFFF is a multi-functional complex containing all of the plutonium handling, fuel processing, and fuel fabrication operations. The MOX Fuel Fabrication Building (BMF) is a multi-story, hardened reinforced concrete structure enclosing approximately 441,000 sq. ft. The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems are designed to provide and maintain the required indoor design conditions for the facilities during normal, upset, and accident conditions. The HVAC systems prevent the spread of contamination in the facility and provide the required operating environment and minimize the release of contamination into the atmosphere. Air-operated isolation (single and multiple blade), back-draft, manual operated isolation (single and multiple blade), manual operated volume/balance, and iris balance dampers are installed in the HVAC systems to regulate or isolate air flow.  Fire dampers interrupt air flow in the event of a fire.  Tornado dampers protect building HVAC systems from rapid depressurization due to a tornado.
 
The purpose of this Expression of Interest (EOI) is to obtain a listing of subcontractors interested in qualifying, bidding, and potentially supplying multiple dampers for MFFF HVAC systems.  Proposals will be solicited from qualified bidders by Request for Proposal (RFP) for an award to a single subcontractor to supply these components to MOX Services as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) below.

Potential suppliers interested in this procurement/scope of work should provide the following information to the listed point of contact:
 
1. Company information including company name and address and

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NCOA) - Air Force Subscale Aerial Targets (AFSAT) ? BQM-167A Operations at Alternate Department of Defense (DoD) Test Ranges - The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL is planning to award a sole source modification to an existing contract (FA8675-07-C-0280) with Composite Engineering Inc. (CEi), located at 5381 Raley Blvd, Sacramento, CA 92632 for the contractor to make required target system changes for operation of the BQM-167A subscale aerial target at alternate DoD test ranges.  The BQM-167A is currently operational only on the Gulf Range. This effort shall include the contractor performing the following activities:  (a)  perform a study to evaluate the effects of operating the BQM-167A on alternate DoD test ranges to include the effects of different elevations and environment at the launch site on engine and RATO performance, determine the impact on system operation, and implement any required changes to airborne software and/or procedures; (b) build and install a launch capability at alternate DoD test range locations; (c) in coordination with the Government develop  BQM-167A Modified Airworthiness Certification Criteria (MAAC) for safe operation at alternate DoD test range locations and perform tests and/or analysis to verify compliance with the MACC; (d) support activities to obtain environmental and range safety  approvals for operations of the BQM-167A target at alternate DoD test ranges; (e)  establish ground and flight test plan to provide the data required to verify safe operation of the BQM-167A at alternate DoD test ranges, conduct those tests, and evaluate and report results, (f) provide on-site engineering support on a as needed bases at the alternate DoD test ranges. The 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) will be launching BQM-167A targets for testing and evaluating air-to-air weapon systems and for evaluation/training exercises such as COMBAT ARCHER at alternate DoD test ranges.  The Government does not own a technical data package and/or software data rights for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.  The government anticipates conducting a flight demonstration of the BQM-167A at the alternate DoD test ranges by September 2008.  CEi is the only source able to meet performance and schedule requirements.      
  
The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.  The government has determined that the only way to prevent any adverse impact to critical mission activities that could result from a break in the continuous availability of sub-scale aerial targets is to issue a modification to the exiting contract to the incumbent vendor.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to any specific acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB FL, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Brig Gen Michael N. Wilson, AAC/CR and the alternate is Col Brian D. Buel, AAC/CS both located at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5422.

<DESC>The building is a multi-story hardened reinforced concrete structure enclosing approximately 441,000 sq ft. The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems are designed to provide and maintain the required indoor design conditions for the facilities during normal, upset and accident conditions. The HVAC systems prevent the spread of contamination in the facility and provide the required operating environment and minimize the release of contamination to the atmosphere. The filtration systems provide HEPA filtration to prevent airborne contaminants from spreading to indoor clean areas or to the environment. 

This Expression of Interest (EOI) is seeking subcontractors to design, fabricate and provide multiple Filtration components for the HVAC systems. Proposals will be solicited for a single subcontractor to supply these components to MOX Services as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) below.

Potential suppliers interested in this procurement/scope of work should provide the following information to the listed point of contact:
 
1. Company information including company name and address and
   point of contact with phone number and e-mail address, 
2. A brief description of experience and capabilities with
   regard to supplying this equipment, including applicable
   years of experience in providing this or like equipment. 
3. A summary statement to describe the prospective supplier's
   Quality Program/Plan with regard to meeting requirements of
   ASME NQA-1 w/ 1995 Addendum and/or 10CFR50, Appendix B.

Description of HVAC Systems

The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems are designed to provide and maintain the required indoor design conditions for the facilities during normal, upset and accident conditions. The design utilizes the requirements and guidance from federal and trade guidelines, codes, and standards.

The HVAC systems for the BMF, prevent the spread of contamination in the facility, provide the required operating environment, and minimize the release of contamination to the atmosphere. The design incorporates various static and confinement barriers to accomplish these goals.

The HVAC and dynamic confinement systems are to provide the BMF with highly reliable controlled air environment to suit many variable and diverse requirements. The HVAC and dynamic confinement systems are vital for orderly and safe facilities operation. The filtration systems provide HEPA filtration to prevent airborne contaminants from spreading to indoor clean areas, or to the environment. The systems provide controlled air temperature, pressure to keep facility areas within design conditions, and keep contaminants within special confining areas. The objective is to prevent the spread of contamination in the facility, provide the required operating environment, and minimize the release of contamination to the atmosphere.

Very High Depressurization Exhaust System:

The Very High Depressurization (VHD) Exhaust System maintains a negative pressure differential between the C4 (glovebox) and C3 (process room) confinement zones, filters contaminants from glovebox exhaust gases/air prior to discharge through the exhaust stack, and maintain an environment suitable for the manufacturing process. The VHD exhaust system provides HVAC flow required to remove excess heat generated by processes, maintains inert or special atmospheres required by the processes, and provides confinement airflow through postulated breaches. The VHD exhaust system also controls the effects of system pressure transients on glovebox confinement boundary integrity maintaining pressure inside the glovebox suitable for working in gloves, and prevent over-pressurization (positive and negative) of the glovebox. The glovebox atmosphere is exhausted through two stages of HEPA filters at the Glovebox boundary. 
One stage of HEPA filters at the C3 boundary and two stages of final HEPA filters prior to being discharged to the atmosphere.  The VHD system consists of eight (8) 100% capacity exhaust fans and four (4) trains of two stage final HEPA filtration. There are two 100% redundant filter trains.

High Depressurization Exhaust System:

The High Depressurization Exhaust (HDE) System maintains a negative pressure differential between the C3 (process room) confinement zone and the C2 confinement zone. The HDE system ventilates the 3013 can storage area in the C2 confinement zone, the emergency power supply rooms serving the VHD Exhaust System fans, the Process Cell Exhaust System fans, and the HDE system fans in the C2 confinement zone. The HDE system filters contaminants from the exhausted air prior to discharge through the BMF building exhaust stack and maintains an environment suitable for operating personnel. The HDE system consists of two 100% capacity exhaust fans and two stages of HEPA filtration.  There are two 100% redundant filter trains.

Process Cell Exhaust System:

The Process Cell Exhaust (POE) System maintains a negative pressure differential between the process cell confinement zone and the C2 confinement zone, while filtering contaminants from process cell exhaust air prior to discharge through the exhaust stack, maintaining an environment suitable for the manufacturing process. The system exhausts air from the process cells in the AP Area rooms that are not normally accessible, which contain welded process equipment. Air is supplied near the ceiling and removed near the floor (above the level of potential liquid spills). The POE system consists of two 100% capacity exhaust fans and at least two stages of HEPA filtration. There are two 100% redundant filter trains each with one of the two fans.

Medium Depressurization Exhaust System

The Medium Depressurization Exhaust (MDE) System maintains a negative pressure differential between the C2 confinement zone and C1 confine zones, filtering contaminants from the exhaust air prior to discharge through the exhaust stack. The MDE System needs to maintain an environment suitable for operating personnel, while providing a common exhaust stack for discharge of process vents, and ventilation exhaust. Airflow can be measured in the exhaust ducts. The system will consist of two 100% capacity exhaust fans and at least two stages of HEPA filtration.

Summary of Air Flows

* VHD System: 4950 CFM, 276 gloveboxes and 64 flow circuits.
  Largest flow glovebox 383 CFM
* HDE System: 92,190 CFM, 194 rooms and 14 flow circuits 
  (i.e., intermediate filters).  Largest room 5,200 CFM
* POE System: 9,050 CFM, 22 Process Cells and no intermediate
  filters.  Largest room 2,350 CFM
* MDE System: 94,070 CFM, 291 rooms and no intermediate filters.
  Largest room 3,100 CFM
? HVAC Air Supply System (HSA): 197,440 CFM, supplies air to 
  506 rooms.

All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with DME Corporation located in Orlando, FL. The Government intends to procure Interim Spare and Repair Parts required to support initial fielding of H-60 Hybrid Test Station (HTS) Lot II Offload to Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) 02 ON677/USM636(V) and H60 OTPS 03 ON672/USM636(V) in December 2008, under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The HTS spare parts are required to support the CASS OTPSs, which are being designed and developed by DME Corporation.

A complete technical data package will not be available until June 2008 and a 6 month lead time to produce the spares is anticipated. Spares must be of the same configuration as the production items and only DME Corporation can ensure that any design changes to the production unit will also be incorporated into the spares.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a continuation of an existing contractual agreement for an independent assessment of NASA?s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) matters, and the protection of the NAVSTAR Global Positioning Systems (GPS), along with the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).  As communication technology continues to expand, protection becomes more and more challenging, because communication devices can easily interfere with GNSS signals if not properly controlled. NASA?s Office of Space Communications requires the specialized services of a senior level technical expert with multiple years of experience in SCaN, NAVSTAR, GNSS, GPS and spectrum protection. The proposed senior level expert would provide technical advice on the protection of GPS and GNSS frequency bands from International emitters and on GNSS receivers and new National and International GNSS Navigation signals.  Areas of required are:  1) ITU-R Working Party 8D Support ITU-R Working Party 8D has been tasked for generating ITU-R recommendations providing technical characteristics and protection criteria for Radio navigation-Satellite service systems used in interference studies. 2) New National and International GNSS Navigation Signals GPS are in the process of modernization.	One aspect of this modernization is the addition of new civil signals that would enhance the performance of GPS for civil users. 3) Depart. of Commerce Plan to Determine the Emission Limits Necessary to Protect Spectrum used by U.S. Space Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, Augmentation, and Support Systems The objective of this plan, recently completed, will protect current and future GPS operations.	4) National Space-Based PNT Engineering Forum (NPEF). This forum was established as a permanent Working Group by the National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing to work systems engineering issues and technology development opportunities relative to GPS and GPS augmentation systems consistent with the PNT policy.   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with A. J. Systems for the unique expertise skills and knowledge of Dr. A. J. Dierendonck.  Professor Dierendonck has worked on NAVSTAR Global Positioning Systems (GPS) programs for over 32 years and continues to work in the following subject areas ionosphere scintillation effects on GNSS, GNSS spectrum protection and future GNSS and SBAS civil signal structures.  Dr. Dierendonck is uniquely qualified to perform this activity based upon past experience.   He has supported NASA in the RTCA Special Committee SC 159 that defines requirements for the use of GNSS for Civil Aviation, and specifically as a member of SC 159 Working Group, which is chartered with the assessment of interference to GNSS, and an assessment of compatibility between signals of different GNSS systems. With GPS Silicon Valley, he led the development of prototype L1/L5 signal generators for the next generation WAAS and supported on-orbit testing of Inmarsat4. To try and duplicate this effort is not feasible given the knowledge and experience necessary and the time allotted for this effort to be performed. It is in the best interest of the government to continue with the current contactor because of duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. NASA/HQ intends to award a purchase order for continued performance of specialized services to A.J. Systems for the unique services of Dr. A. J. Van Dierendonck a technical consultant.  The authority is FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii)(A) "only one responsible source?. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing, by FAX or E-Mail, to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on January 31, 2008. Such capabilities/ qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

All inquiries should be submitted via email.

Point of Contact:
Felicia Goudy, goudyfd@state.gov 


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

1.	I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of four 64 kbps dedicated circuits in support of an International Agreement between Washington and Minsk, Belarus, Kiev, Ukraine, Almaty, Kazakhstan and Moscow, Russia.  The estimated cost is $332,000.

2.	The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Office of Chief Information Officer (CIO) has a critical need to lease four dedicated 64 kilo bits per second (kbps) circuits in support of the re-routing of existing dedicated circuits between Washington and Minsk, Kiev and Almaty and Moscow.   

Background: The circuits support the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC).  The NRRC was established under the September 15th 1987 agreement to exchange official government communications in support of the first Strategic Arms Limitation and Intermediated Range Nuclear Missile Treaties (START I/INF). The U.S. Secretary of State and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the 1987 NRRC agreement. The Lisbon Protocol of START Treaty in 1992 assumed obligations of the Republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.  The International Agreement requires multiple and diverse dedicated satellite paths to support telecommunications requirements. The 1987 NRRC agreement and subsequent classified Presidential Directives required the Chief Information Officer for the U.S. State Department lead all international technical discussions concerning NRRC telecommunications. The international discussions are held on an annual basis and are formally designated U.S. - Russian Technical Experts Meetings.  The State Department CIO, along with his Russian counterpart signs the resulting NRRC Protocol at the Technical Expert?s Meeting each year. This NRRC Protocol contains all agreed upon technical requirements to maintain critical NRRC communications. 

  		
3.	The contractor is to provide a dedicated 64 kbs circuits between the Department of State, Silver Spring Maryland and Minsk, Moscow, Kiev and Almaty teleports.  Other technical requirements include the use of the INTELSAT 342 via F1 at Silver Spring space platform, the ?C? band frequency range, an E1 drop and insert satellite modem, an Newbridge 3600 multiplexer supporting RS422 and RS 232 interfaces. The contractor will also provide 24 hours on site technical support and work closely with designated government technical staff in trouble shooting circuit, satellite and multiplexer interface problems.  Estimated cost is $332,000.  


4.	The statutory authorities permitting other than full and open competition are as follows:              10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

5.	Intelsat General is the only vendor able to provide both technical and operational support at this time because they are the sole owner and operator of the Silver Spring teleport and have agreed to meet all government requirements for the circuit.


6.	Efforts to solicit offers will be attempted utilizing FedBizOpps to publicize the requirement.
 
7.	The Contracting Officer determined the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the following documents provided by the vendor:  Current task order and invoices provide pricing that is comparable to proposed pricing.

8.	Limited market research was completed for this project because Intelsat General is the only vendor able to provide technical and operational support because they are the sole owner and operator of the Silver Spring teleport.

9.	There are not further facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

10.	?Notice of Intent to Sole Source? will be publicized on FedBizOpps to afford potential sources the ability to express, in writing, an interest in this acquisition.

11.	Intelsat General is the only vendor able to provide technical and operational support because they are the sole owner and operator of the Silver Spring teleport.  An RFI will be publicized to acquire information on alternate sources and methods that may satisfy this ongoing requirement.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full complement of services required, including qualified personnel, material, equipment, volunteers, and facilities to study the biology of medically important viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate live virus vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the administration of wild type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. Wild type viruses might also be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines.

Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since the viruses studied cause severe disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of viral pathogens and serve as a testing center for the development of new investigational vaccines effective against these agents.

NIAID intends to award a five-year contract with five (5) one-year options. This is not a Request for Proposals. The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about February 8, 2008 from www.fedbizopps.gov. No hard copies will be distributed. All questions must be submitted in writing to Alexander Kramer (kramera@niaid.nih.gov).

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate with Electronic Data Systems 13600 EDS Drive Herndon, Virginia 20171, on a sole-source basis for continued maintenance of their Interactive Video Tele-training (IVT) Satellite System ? IVT Satellite Integrator, which is a portion of the entire IVT network.  The IVT network currently delivers Social Security Administration (SSA) training material to a majority of Headquarters, field office (FO), Office of Disability Adjudication Review (ODAR) and Disability and Determination Services (DDS) employees nationwide.

The IVT Network was developed to provide an economical training delivery system to support our customer. The customer, in this case is the IVT downlink sites or FO, the IVT studio personnel and the Office of Training.  The FO IVT system consists of satellite receivers, a viewer response system, video cassette recorder (VCR) and a big screen television.  The FO participant receives the IVT broadcast from the satellite receiver and views this on their big screen television.  The FO participant can respond to the instructor through the viewer response system.  This technology enables instructor / student based communication to occur ? resulting in two-way communication.

The IVT Network is comprised of two systems:

?	The IVT Satellite System
o	Satellite Transponder Air-Time (STAT)
o	IVT Satellite Integrator (ISI)
?	Satellite Uplink System
?	Satellite Downlink System
?	Satellite System Re-pointing
?	IVT Satellite On Site Technical Personnel/Helpdesk
?	VCCC Project Management
?	Portable Satellite Maintenance
?	Optional ? Purchase of New Equipment
?	SSA and other United States Government Agencies
?	The IVT Classroom System
o	Viewer Response System (One Touch)
o	Video Cassette Recorder
o	Big Screen Television
o	IVT Classroom Network Management

The IVT Satellite Integrator is summarized below:

Satellite Uplink System

The satellite uplink system is currently located at the National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD.  The state of the art digital uplink facility is the collective source of 7 IVT studios.  SSA has 7 fully equipped studios and 1 partially equipped studio.  There are 3 broadcast studios in Baltimore, MD, 1 studio in ? Kansas City, MO; Atlanta, GA; Dallas, TX and Seattle, WA; and the partially equipped studio in New York, New York.  Once the studio signals are received in the Visual Communication Control Center (VCCC), the signals are then digitized, combined, scrambled, encrypted, compressed and transmitted to the satellite uplink antenna and then dispersed to the IVT classroom downlinks.

Satellite Downlink System

The satellite downlink system is installed in the majority of Headquarters, FO, ODAR and DDS sites.  The standard satellite downlink system consists of a (1) 1.2M or 2.4M Prodelin satellite dish, (1) Low Noise Block down converter (LNB), (1) Dual feedhorn, (1) non-penetrating roof mount, cable and Integrated Receiver Descrambler (IRD).  Most offices, except for ODAR offices, are installed with two IRD?s.  The ODAR office typically has only one IRD.  Currently, SSA has approximately 1640 FO?s installed with the IVT system.

SSA anticipates the award of a firm fixed-price purchase order for the period February 1, 2008 through March 31, 2008.  The Government will consider all responses to this notice, but a determination by the Government to conduct a sole source acquisition remains at the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information submitted. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Leslie Hyman, Contract Specialist, via email at Leslie.Hyman@ssa.gov. Responses must be received by 2:00 p.m. EST on January 28,2008. If no viable responses are received by January 28, 2008, the Government will issue a Purchase Order to Electronic Data Systems.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Marshall Communications Corporation for the continued satellite airtime services for the period February 1, 2008 through March 31, 2008. The Satellite Transponder Air-Time (STAT),is a portion of the entire IVT network.  The IVT network currently delivers Social Security Administration (SSA) training material to a majority of Headquarter, field office (FO), Office of Hearing and Appeals (OHA) and Disability and Determination Services (DDS) employees nationwide.

The IVT Network was developed to provide an economical training delivery system to support our customer. The customer, in this case, is the IVT downlink sites or FO, the IVT studio personnel and the Office of Training.  The FO IVT system consists of satellite receivers, a viewer response system, video cassette recorder (VCR) and a big screen television.  The FO participant receives the IVT broadcast from the satellite receiver and views this on their television.  The FO participant can respond to the instructor through the viewer response system.  This technology enables instructor/student based communication to occur ? resulting in two-way communication.

The IVT Satellite System deployed by SSA is the delivery system of content material provided by the Office of Training.    

The STAT is summarized below:

Satellite Transponder Air-Time

The satellite transponder is a leased commodity from a satellite supplier.  A satellite normally has between 24 ? 36 transponders.  SSA currently leases one-third of one transponder.  Telestar IV is the current satellite that SSA utilizes.  Telestar IV was chosen for its coverage of the CONUS (Continental US), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin islands.  This is important because not all domestic satellites have the geographic footprint of Telestar IV.  Currently, the on-air satellite time for SSA is from 7:30 AM ? 9:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.  

 C.2	Mandatory Requirements

The Government requires two main categories of the STAT Contractor to fulfill in this contract:

1.	Provide the required satellite bandwidth and airtime, and
2.	Provide the professional services within a multi-contractor environment.

These documents will be updated no less than every six months or when a change to the operating system has occurred.
SSA anticipates the award of a firm fixed-price purchase order for the period February 1, 2008 through March 31, 2008.     The Government will consider all responses to this notice, but a determination by the Government to conduct a sole source acquisition remains at the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information submitted. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Leslie Hyman, Contract Specialist, via email at Leslie.Hyman@ssa.gov. Responses must be received by 2:00 p.m. EST on January 28,2008. If no viable responses are received by January 28, 2008, the Government will issue a Purchase Order to Marshall Communications Corporation.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract to Kindred Hospitals, located at 705 Juniper Street, NE, Atlanta, GA, for Long term Acute Care (LTAC).  Due to the nature of this requirement, limited providers, and the limited capacity in the Atlanta area this approach is viewed as the most expedient way to establish services for the Atlanta VA Medical Center (VAMC) Veteran population.

It is anticipated that approximately 6 to 12 patients a year will require services from one to six months.  Individuals requiring care beyond this point will be returned to the VAMC.  If you believe you can provide this service to the VAMC and will have the capacity, please contract or send your bid proposals to Rob Joshua at (404) 728-4825 or robelto.joshua@va.gov by 22 Feb 2008.  If no viable contacts or proposals are received by this date we will proceed with award.  The NAICS are 622310, $31.5M; and 621399, $6.5M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification 6 is (1) to post questions and answers, (2) to incorporate a new clause (Each offeror *must* include this clause in their Part B Pricing Proposal.), and (3) provide a corrected Statement of Work. The revised Statement of Work will be uploaded Friday, January 25 as a word document titled Solicitation 04. The deadline for responding to this Solicitation and for submitting sample rifles remains as February 29, 2008. 

1. Does the government anticipate an extension for this solicitation? 
Response: Any extensions will be posted on www.fbo.gov. 

2. What is the anticipated delivery schedule for the successful bidder?
Response: Per the Statement of Work, see SOW Item 57, all tools and spare parts shall be delivered ... no later than 30 days prior to the first delivery of rifles. For delivery of the rifles, see the new clause at the end of this amendment, 52.211-8 Time of Delivery (JUN 1997), which each offeror will need to fill out and return with their proposal.

3. Item 19 states that the receiver shall be warranted for the life of the weapon. Does this mean 20,000 rounds or can the government provide further guidance as to life of weapon?
Response: Technically, the receiver is not under stress, and therefore should have an indefinite life. However, for the sake of the test, 20,000 rounds are required for completion of the Reliability and Endurance phase.

4. Item 22 states (a ) height, ( b ) weight, ( c ) Length of weapon requirements. Will there be any variance given to these requirements such as a range of tolerance? IE: length of 35 inches, will 36 inches be acceptable? 
Response: No, 36 inches is not acceptable. However, SOW Item 22 C is changed to read: Overall length with stock extended may not exceed 35 inches (see SOW Rev 12 dated January 25, 2008).

5. Item 23 states the magazine body must be made of aluminum with anti tilt follower. Is aluminum the only acceptable magazine body material or may vendors submit steel body magazines to increase durability that still uses a non-tilt follower? 
Response: No. Aluminum is the only acceptable material for the body of the magazine.

6. Item 38 states integral waterproof storage compartment. Does the compartment have to be water-proof as an objective requirement and can the compartment be water-resistant as a threshold requirement. 
Response: Water-proof to the extent that rain and weather can not enter the compartment, but not to the extent that it is water-tight in the event the weapon is submerged in water. 

7. Item 41 states means to mount a sling to either the side of buttstock, the receiver plate, and the Picatinny rail on the handguard. Must the weapon have a means to mount the sling at all three locations or is two locations at each end of the weapon acceptable (for example: ambidextrous attachment points on the gas block and on the buttstock?
Response: Three mounting locations are required and are identified in Item 41. 

8. Item 41 states to 'mount a sling to either the side of buttstock, the receiver plate, and the Picatinny rail on the handguard'. Is it acceptable to have a sling attachment point on the barrel/gas block instead of on the picatinny handguard rail allowing a slimmer profile? 
Response: No, a mounting point on the gas block is not acceptable. 

9. Item 44 states front square post adjustable for elevation. Is it acceptable for the rear sight to adjust for both windage and elevation in lieu of adjusting the front sight for elevation?
Response: No, the requirement stands as stated. 

10. Item 44, 45, and 46 Folding Sights must be viewable through the lower third portion of an Aimpoint '.. and calibrated for M855 ammunition'. Is it acceptable if the vendor has sights that are viewable in the lower third portion of an Aimpoint, and calibrated for M855 ammunition and a 14.5 inch barrel? Will a folding front sight and fixed rear sight be acceptable?
Response: No, the sights must the requirements stated. Please refer to SOW Item 46, the primary sight is an Aimpoint.

11. Items 44, 45, and 46. Provided the accuracy requirement is approximately 5 Minutes Of Angle, will a fixed rear sight be acceptable in lieu of a folding rear sight if it meets the criteria in item 46 and can the rear sight be used for major elevation adjustments from 100-400 meters, and likewise used for minor elevation adjustments instead of the front sight? 
Response: No, USSS requires a clear field of view when operating the aimpoint. The requirement stands as stated. 
 
12. Item 44, 45, and 46. Would it be advantageous to have a sighting system (front and rear that was nearly identical in operation and training to legacy USSS weapons and uses existing sight tools in USSS inventory? 
Response: The USSS Assault Rifle evaluation is not based on existing inventory or training. The requirement stands as stated. 

13. Item 44, 45, and 46 Folding Sights. Is there a current sighting system that is preferred by the USSS for this solicitation? If so, please provide item name and part numbers. 
Response: Please refer to Item 46, the information is provided. 

14. Item 51 Cleaning kit. Does the cleaning kit need to be the specific item listed NSN 1005-01-541-7228 (Cleaning kit, Rifle)?
Response: No, however, cleaning kit components must be compatible and interchangeable (in all aspects) to the kit referenced in the solicitation. 

15. Item 55 states supply all spare parts to perform preventive maintenance to 20,000 rounds (per weapon). What is the anticipated lead time for the first delivery of weapons, once awarded? 
Response: For delivery of the rifles, see the new clause, 52.211-8 Time of Delivery (JUN 1997), which each offeror will need to fill out and return with their proposal.

16. Item 56 states supply all special tools, in sets of four, required to service the weapon. Are these items to be delivered with the first set of rifles for the successful bidder?
Response: SOW Item 57 clearly states that all tools and parts will be received no later than 30 days prior to the first delivery of rifles. 

17. Item 57 states tools and spare parts shall be delivered to the USSS/RTC Armory NLT 30 days prior to the first delivery of rifles. Is this 30 day prior mark for items to be delivered after the contract award?
Response: SOW Item 57 clearly states that all tools and parts will be received no later than 30 days prior to the first delivery of rifles. 

 18. Item 44 states front sight blade thickness of .050-.075 inches. Would the government consider broadening the requirement to include .40 -.075 to increase accuracy? 
Response: No, the requirement stands as stated. 

19. Do you have specifications on the procedure and a definition of "test to failure" (as in Post-Evaluation Notes). 
Response: Test to Failure means - shoot the weapon until a stoppage occurs which renders the weapon unserviceable until "factory armorer-level maintenance? is performed. Examples of this include stress cracks requiring component replacement, barrel replacement, etc.

20. Will a limited waiver of liability be issued because the vendors do not know the extent of these tests? 
Response: USSS does not see a need for such a waiver since our inspection process is designed to identify safety concerns before a catastrophic event occurs. 

21. Does USSS want vendors to submit independent test data for review?
Response: No vendor test data is required. 

22. Regarding SOW Item #8: The weapon shall utilize a gas operated short stroke piston system," will a submitted rifle using a true gas trap be compliant?
Response: The short stroke system provides cooler, cleaner firing and best facilitates operator preventative and post operations maintenance.

23. Regarding SOW Item #42: The bore and chamber shall be chromium plated, will a submitted rifle of a specialty steel that does not require chrome to protect the bore, a barrel having a progressive gain twist polygon bore, be compliant?
Response: Chrome plating protects the bore and chamber from rust and corrosion, fills micro-fissures in the barrel steel thus making the bore and chamber easier to clean. 

24. Is a 5.56mm M4 assault rifle manufactured in accordance to military specification available in semi-automatic or select-fire (fully automatic) acceptable?
Response: If the weapon meets the requirements specified in the Statement of Work (noted in Solicitation HSSSS01-08-R-0008), it will be accepted for evaluation.

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received  from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date; the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate ? level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.  In order to assist respondents with replying to this  sources sought synopsis a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:  Firms responding to this announcement  should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small  disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small  business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.

Any proposal late is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late submissions, Modifications, and withdrawls of Bids (NOV 1999).  A pre-proposal meeting has been scheduled for February 12, 2008.  Information regarding the meeting is contained in the solicitation posting.

Modification I
The release date for the solicitation will be on or about January 10, 2008, with a pre-solicitation meeting to be held the week of January 28, 2008.  Further information on the pre-solicitation meeting will be given in the solicitation posting.

Original Notice
The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is contracting on behalf of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for a general contractor for a new laboratory building (B1E) in Boulder, Colorado.  

The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world.  The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance.   The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to 5 percent, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to less than 3 micrometers/second.  At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices. 

The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST?s most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness.  The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST?s continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. 

The solicitation will be published on or about December 5, 2007, with an award anticipated for the summer of 2008.  The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000 to $80,000,000.  Completion time for this project is estimated at nine hundred (900) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.  All project requirements and submission information will be available electronically and without charge through Fed Biz Opps on or about December 5, 2007.

Source selection will be made using best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1).   The government will not pay for any information solicited.  Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.  

All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet at 800-234-3867 or on line at 
https://www.dnb.com and click on ?get a D&B D-U-N-S number?.


This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $31 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder area) business concern participation.  Please refer to the SBA website for additional details at www.sba.gov.

<DESC>A001:  

Questions pertaining to the RFQ-CO2008810006 (R- Definitional Mission: Europe & Eurasia Regional: Romania & Lithuania LNG/LPG Import Terminal). 

 
Questions:

1. The synopsis states that proposals will be accepted via e-mail. What e-mail should be used to send the proposal?

 Response: contract@ustda.gov

2. Do we still need to mail 2 copies of the proposal, if we decide to submit our proposal via e-mail by January 23rd, 2008 12:00 PM.

 Response: No.

3. Can we assume that the project start date will be in the 1st week of February? This would be a big help with preparing a project schedule.

 Response: The first half of February would be a reasonable assumption.

4. Based on our understanding, the final report should be delivered on or about April 30, 2008. Why the Period of Performance for this contract is one year? Should we budget for additional tasks after April 30th?

 Response:  No additional tasks are anticipated after acceptance of the final report.  Acceptance of the final report is not instantaneous and time after the initial submission allots for numerous unexpected events.

5. How many project officials would we meet in each host country during our visit? Do they speak English? 

Response: It will be incumbent on the vendor to determine the exact number of officials to meet with, as well as the need for translation services.  Vendors cannot assume that the officials will be fluent enough in English to conduct business meetings.

6. Is there more than one meeting location in each country? This would help in planning the lenght of the visit and the cost associated with each visit.

Response: It is up to the vendor to determine the best course of action, but it would likely be most prudent to visit the US Embassy and project site in each country.  

7. Would we be required to translate the final report into Romanian and Lithuanian?

Response: No.

8. Would we have access to other USTDA reports conducted for other host countries but are similar in nature?

Response: If there are similar reports, they will be available to the contractor through USTDA's library.


Extension: This solicitation RFQ-CO208810006 has been extended in response to the questions above. If you have submitted a quote on the due date of 1/23/2008 you may rescind or amend your RFQ.

Answer # 3:
The US Mint has chosen the two-source approach based on careful consideration of all alternatives.

<CONTACT>LYNDA MCCARTHY CONTRACT sPECIALIST 7036487394     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Water Resources Discipline (WRD) anticipates entering into non-competitive discussions with Ingress of Redwood City, California, to procure discipline wide Ingres software maintenance for all licenses currently installed on WRD computers.  The Ingres software to be maintained includes:  IngresDBMS; Ingres Knowledge Management; Ingres Object Management; Ingres Query & Reporting Tools; Ingres Serve Net; Ingres OpenRoad Development; Ingres Replicator and Ingres Embedded SQL (C, Fortran).  Based on information available at this time, the Government considers the required software maintenance to be sole source as the software to be maintained is proprietary.  Therefore, only licensed agents of Ingres will be acceptable.  The anticipated period of performance is a base period of six months with four one year option periods.  The contract will provide for the following:  (1) discipline side Ingres software maintenance to include new software versions, updates, patches, and documentation of each supported platform on which the existing software is installed; (2) Ingress technical support via telephone to WRD users; and (3) one set of software releases/updates/patches on the required media for each hardware platform.  Firms who believe they can provide the required software maintenance services are invited to submit an affirmative response within 15 days of the publication date of this notice in accordance with numbered Note 22.  Responses should include full technical information on the vendor in such detail as to enable the Government to confirm the submitters capabilities.  All such responses will be evaluated in order to determine whether that firm has full knowledge of the USGS's requirement for maintenance of the above software in accordance with the minimum mandatory requirements.  An affirmative response shall, at a minimum, include company literature, brochures and other such information corresponding to the required services which demonstrates a bona fide ability to provide the required services.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) IS NOT AVAILABLE.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) plans to digitize the entire collection of legacy materials that have been disseminated through the Federal Depository Library Program. The estimated size of the collection is approximately 2.2 million documents, which amounts to about 90 million pages.  GPO is requesting information from industry specifics to the digitization of publications that are within scope of GPO?s dissemination programs that only exist in tangible format. Information received by GPO on this effort will be used to assess the viability of GPO?s digitization plans, and may be used to revise GPO?s Federal Digital System (FDsys) documentation and plans in order to deliver key content functionality.

GPO envisions a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship with a private or public sector participant where the fully faithful, uncompressed, unaltered files created as a result of the conversion process are delivered to GPO. These files will serve as the digital master copies that will be preserved and used for the creation of access derivatives within FDsys. In exchange, the private or public sector participant will be able to maintain a collection of files produced in the process for inclusion in their collections (e.g., search indices, book search sites). 

Background on GPO?s Digitization Efforts
In ?A Strategic Vision for the 21st Century", released in December 2004, the U.S. Government Printing Office put forth a plan to digitize all Federal publications back to the earliest days of the republic. The Vision included the development of a Digital Content System, as put forth in plans for FDsys. One of the strategic goals of the Vision is to digitize a complete legacy collection of tangible U.S. Government publications to ensure a no fee public access to these materials that remain available, in the public domain, for permanent public access.






The legacy collection of tangible Federal publications consists of approximately 2.2 million titles held in depository library collections located throughout the United States and the territories. Best estimates place the total page count at over 90 million pages. The collection consists of publications in many different forms, including books, pamphlets, oversized maps and posters, and microform. Most of the materials that are expected to be digitized in conjunction with this effort are mainly books, pamphlets, and microform (microfiche). While the overall goal of the project is to digitize the entire collection of Federal publications, GPO may consider a phased approach for the execution of the digitization and may have several private or public sector participants assisting with the project.   

The objective of this digitization effort, and the driving factor in GPO digitization, is to ensure that these materials are available, in the public domain, for no-fee permanent public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). 

GPO has set standards for the digitization process. While GPO envisions a relationship where a private or public sector participant provides the actual digitization services for most publications of standard size and structure, GPO may digitize a number of documents in-house (or collaborate with other Federal agencies or Federal Depository Libraries), which may include rare or fragile documents requiring special handling, oversized documents requiring a planetary scanner, or any document requiring ?rush? processing. In addition, GPO envisions a collaborative workflow in which the private or public sector participant could flag specific parts of a publication (e.g., oversized foldouts) that will be digitized by GPO, a Federal agency, or a Federal Depository Library.  

Background in the Federal Depository Library Program
For more than 140 years, The Government Printing Office (GPO) has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government?s information, this program involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.

The mission of the FDLP is to disseminate information products from all three branches of the Government to over 1,250 libraries nationwide. Libraries that have been designated as Federal depositories will maintain this information product as part of their existing collection and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided by the FDLP.

Background on FDsys:

In response to the growing need to have a centralized repository of Federal Government content, GPO is developing a system (FDsys) that will manage, authenticate, preserve, and provide version control for content that falls within scope of GPO?s dissemination programs. FDsys will ingest, preserve, and provide access to the information produced by all three branches of the U.S. Government. The proposed system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving any type of digital content, independent of specific hardware and/or software. 

FDsys will enable GPO customers to obtain hard copy publications and to electronically access the content they want, and it will enable GPO to deliver that content in the formats its customer?s desire. The system is intended to automate many of the content lifecycle processes and make it easier to deliver the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. 

Content in FDsys will include all known Federal Government documents, but is specifically targeted to those within the scope of GPO?s Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), whether printed or born digital. This content will be entered into the system and then authenticated and catalogued according to GPO metadata and document creation standards. Content may include text and associated graphics, video and sound and other forms of content that emerge. Content will be available for Web searching and Internet viewing, downloading and printing, and as document masters for conventional and on-demand printing, or other dissemination methods. 
All files created as a result of the digitization process will be ingested, managed, authenticated, preserved, and accessed through FDsys. 
Background Material
Additional background material is available through various locations on GPO?s website. It is strongly encouraged that all attendees be familiar with the following documents:
?	FDsys Concept of Operations - V 2.0 (PDF) - The document which provides a high-level conceptual vision of the FDsys.

?	FDsys Requirements Document - V 3.0 (PDF) - The document which identifies the preliminary requirements for the FDsys.

?	FDsys Operational Specification for Converted Content (Version 3.3): (PDF) ? The document which identifies the detailed specifications for converted content to be accepted and ingested by FDsys.

?	Specifications and Operating Procedures for Quality Control: Creation of Preservation Master Files (Version 1.1): This is the specification GPO plans to use that covers all the necessary requirements and elements required for the quality control of converted, or digitized, content.

Opportunity

GPO envisions a mutually beneficial relationship with a private or public sector participant that can digitize GPO?s entire legacy collection according to the specifications outlined in GPO?s FDsys Operational Specification for Converted Content (Version 3.3), located at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/legacy/registry/fdsysspec_converted_content3.3.pdf. The private or public sector participant should also use GPO?s Specifications and Operating Procedures for Quality Control: Creation of Preservation Master Files, located at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/legacy/specification-qc-v1-1.pdf, as the basis for performing quality control of digitized content.

GPO assumes that the private or public sector participant will possess equipment and technology to perform large-scale digitization that would result in output which is in accordance to the approved GPO standards referenced above. As part of this arrangement, GPO would provide tangible documents for scanning from either in-house sources or procured via FDLP libraries, and prioritize material to be sent to the private or public sector participant for digitization. The private or public sector participant will be required to send the ?dis-bound? tangible documents back to GPO after the digitization is complete.

GPO has set standards for preservation master files that come from the digitization process. While GPO envisions a relationship where a private or public sector participant provides the actual digitization services for most publications of standard size and structure, GPO may digitize a number of documents in-house (or collaborate with other Federal agencies or Federal Depository Libraries), which may include rare or fragile documents requiring special handling, oversized documents requiring a planetary scanner, or any document requiring ?rush? processing. In addition, GPO envisions a collaborative workflow with the in which the private or public sector participant could flag specific parts of a publication (e.g., oversized foldouts) that will be digitized by GPO, a Federal agency, or a Federal Depository Library.  

As the key deliverable from this arrangement, the private or public sector participant would, at a minimum, provide to GPO the fully faithful, uncompressed, unaltered TIFF files created as a result of the scanning process. These files will serve as the digital master copies that will be preserved and used for the creation of access derivatives within FDsys. The private or public sector firm should provide GPO with derivatives of the content that may be optimized for other uses (e.g., screen or print optimized PDF files). 

GPO would also entertain proposals for the private or public sector participant hosting the digitized content and providing access to it through their search and retrieval systems. 

As part of the arrangement, the private or public sector participant could have the benefit of storing and providing access to digitize and screen optimized publications through their own channels (e.g., search indices, book content searches). 

Requested Information:

Keeping GPO?s goals in mind please outline how your company would be able to meet the digitization needs of GPO.  Potential participants who are interested in this project must submit a packet of material which includes:

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps System Command (MCSC), Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Communications and Control (C2) Weapons and Sensors Development and Integration (MC2I), Radar Systems Program Manager is seeking information from industry with regard to a Product Improvement Program (PIP) for the AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System. The PIP is envisioned as a two phase effort.  The first phase effort will replace the existing array structure with a new, transportable, light-weight array that uses the existing interface with the AN/TPS-59(V)3 Data Processing Group (DPG)/Control Shelter.  The second phase effort will update the software to fully optimize the capabilities of the replacement array and will include a technical refresh of the DPG electronics to eliminate the need for a control shelter.  The system shall be fully compliant with the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) at the completion of the second phase. To ensure program affordability, the replacement array provided during Phase I must be controllable with the AN/TPS-59(V)3 DPG/Control Shelter, while still providing an upgrade path for a 3DELRR capable system during Phase II.  The PIP is envisioned as a single contract award for Phase I with options for the Phase II effort.  The Marine Corps completed an effort to mitigate the risk associated with the development of a system that meets the capabilities of the 3DELRR CDD.  The effort was the development of a Composite Material Risk Reduction Array (CMRRA).  The CMRRA is a full size mechanical array structure that is transportable via a single seven ton truck.  Salient characteristics of the CMRRA are provided as attachment (1) to this RFI.  The CMRRA, as built, does not satisfy all of the capability requirements of the 3DELRR CDD.  Resource limitations constrained the Marine Corps? ability to develop a fully production representative structure.  However, the resultant analysis from the CMRRA effort does indicate that development of a system that is compliant with all requirements of the 3DELRR CDD is achievable.  Developmental testing of CMRRA was conducted, and results of that testing are available upon request. Respondents to this RFI are asked to provide the following information: (1)	Present a proposed two phase PIP approach that replaces the existing AN/TPS-59(V)3 array with a new array that retains the full functionality of the existing radar system while ensuring the second phase delivers a system that fully satisfies the capability requirements of the 3DELRR CDD.  During Phase II, there should only be minimal redesign/rework of the replacement array provided during Phase I.   (2)	Provide a test strategy to show how you would demonstrate, during Phase I, that the replacement array retains the existing AN/TPS-59(V)3 interfaces and functionality while providing a structure that will support a system that, following Phase II, satisfies the capability requirements of the 3DELRR CDD. (3)	Provide an estimate of the cost impacts associated with providing a system using the two phased approach described above. The cost estimate should focus on the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs that are required during Phase I to ensure a technologically achievable and cost effective solution during Phase II.  (4)	Indicate your interest in using a production representative version of the CMRRA for system development and/or production. A copy of the 3DELRR CDD and the CMRRA test results will be made available for contractor review at the General Dynamics Information Technology, Stafford Virginia office.   Those wishing to review the CDD and CMRRA test results should contact Ms. Cathy Henderson (cathy.henderson.ctr@usmc.mil) no later than 1600 on 11 February 2008.      Responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Lee Hoyland, NLT 10 March 2008. Please submit all information to Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: A/C Contracts/Ms. Lee Hoyland, 2200 Lester St., Quantico, VA 22134-6050. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified businesses capable of providing single in-plant test that is capable of detecting sulfonamides and antibiotics at the tolerance level in porcine and bovine kidney for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  The current in-plant test was developed by FSIS and is called the Fast Antimicrobial Screen Test (FAST).  FAST is capable of detecting beta lactams (both penicillins and cephalosporins), aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfas.  The business concern will need to generate or submit data on a range of drugs from each compound class listed above.  The business concern needs to submit a description of the method used to determine the limits of detection, which should reflect tests run in an appropriate matrix (not water or buffer); limit of detection data on chloramphenicol and florfenicol; and the limits of detection for each drug tested.  A complete description of the procedure, along with estimated times required per analysis, should also be submitted.  FSIS estimates 125,000 test analyses annually, but the agency cannot identify an approximate number until the testing method is implemented.  Business concerns having the capability to provide the described supplies are invited to submit appropriate documentation demonstrating past experience manufacturing this type of supply.  This information will allow the Government to determine what sources are available and interested.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Potential sources should indicate in their response their business status (i.e., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, etc.)  This information will be used to determine whether the procurement can be set-aside for small business concerns.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government is not requesting technical or management proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice.  Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  If a solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential business concerns responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.  Interested qualified businesses are requested to submit a package delineating qualifications, capabilities, and experience for providing the supplies described herein.  Include information on your company?s managerial and technical resources to be able to meet the requirements.  Companies must sufficiently demonstrate that they have actual experience in providing screening test plates, the capability to provide this supply, and qualifications in all previous work pertinent to this effort.  Responses should also include the following: name and address of firm; size of business; number of years in business; and list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact with address and phone number).  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Responses may be submitted by email to Julian.McElveen@fsis.usda.gov; or by mail to Julian McElveen at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Maildrop 5230, Beltsville, MD 20705-5230; or by fax at 301-504-4276.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center is seeking qualified sources who can supply Carrier  Transicold Air Conditioning units; Model 90RMC05-D-610, R-134A Seawater Cooled Chiller 50 Tons Nominal Cooling Capacity; twenty TYPE 2 Carrier Transicold Model 90RMC025-D-6-D005/MS1, R-134A Seawater Cooled Chiller 25 Ton Nominal Circuit-A, 5 Tons Nominal Circuit-B Cooling Capacity along with technical and training services. The air conditioning units will be installed by others onboard each 210?, and 270? Coast Guard vessel to replace their current antiquated air conditioning system.  The Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center anticipates awarding a contract for a base year and four option years.  Estimated quantity to be 3 Carrier Transicold Model 90RMC050-D-610, and 18 Carrier Transicold Model 90RMC025-D-6-D005/MS1.   Brand name is mandatory.  It is the governments belief that the air conditioning units are only available from Carrier or their authorize distributors.    The F.O.B point shall be destination.  The air conditioning units are to be  delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Rd., Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to the air conditioning units are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Carrier.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition as the units are available from Carrier and/or their authorized distributors.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capabilities to supply the units for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves the units being procured from Carrier and/or their authorized distributors.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical function and serviceability, characteristics) (1) show that the units have satisfactorily manufactured the units for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM?s to determine the acceptability of the units.  It is the Government?s belief that only Carrier and/or their authorized distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required complete information discussing capabilities are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detail data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Sharon Jackson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Rd., Auxiliary Systems Acquisition Branch, Mail Stop 99, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000 or e-mail to Sharon.J.Jackson@uscg.mil.

ATTACHMENT 1 STATEMENT OF WORK STATEMENT OF WORK Item 1.  Ship Manager NS5 Data Extraction Tool. As used in this SOW, the term "ship manager" includes MARAD's Logistics Support Contractor's two databases. The contractor will provide a software application which translates the site's (ship manager or logistics contractor site specific) NS5 database into a simplified data structure for use by ship managers in developing reports.  Basic flow of the application should be as follows: "       Extract Data from the 40+ purchasing tables in  NS5 "       Assemble the data from NS5 into a Reporting Application Database for ease of use in the generation of reports.  This simplified schema will include all elements necessary to generate reports used in the conduct of day-to day business by the ship managers. This schema will include all project-related data for each and every purchase transaction, including line items.  "       The application will be able to be run on demand, or via a scheduler, to provide an update to the data resident in the reporting database.  The following specific business rules relate to this application: "       Application will only extract and assemble data from the projects/vendors/purchases under the cognizance of the ship manager.  The application will preclude a ship manager from accessing projects, RFQs, and Vendors of any other ship managers.  "       Application will not expose in any form or fashion the plain text version of the database access password. (ODBC password). "       The application will not write to or edit the production database of the ship manager. "       Any components used by the application for data transformation services must be secured in such a way as to prevent unauthorized access to production data. "       Application must be compatible with the current Windows operating platform environment of the ship manager. Within 30 days of contract award, the contractor will provide the following deliverables in electronic format for the data extraction application: "       Application executables "       Blank database file (SQL Server) "       User's Manual (including Database Schema) "       Installation Routine "       Data Dictionary outlining the schema for the database, defining each data element, and defining the relationships between each table/element (Note: This information may be included in the User's Manual). The contractor is solely responsible for quality assurance testing of the product and of subsequent releases. MARAD is granted a license to the executable binaries for use by the current ship managers and any new ship managers awarded contracts by MARAD within the period of performance of this contract.  Ship Managers shall be entitled to use the application only on their copy of the MARAD NS5 database. Source code for the application will be provided to MARAD in the event that the contractor chooses to, or is not able to, provide maintenance of the application. STATEMENT OF WORK Item 2. Installation and Training Assistance. The contractor will provide software installation setup assistance and training for two days at each ship manager site in support of the reporting application.  This on-site support will include the following: "       Assisting the ship manager's IT staff in the installation of the application in the ship manager environment. "       Configuration of the database and application scheduling in the ship manager environment. "       Training of the ship manager's staff in usage of the application and how to develop reports from the database.  "       The contractor is not required to develop reports for ship managers. Within 20 days of contact award, the contractor will submit a travel schedule for MARAD approval. Unless authorized in advance by MARAD, on-site visits will be concluded within 120 days of contract award. For planning purposes, the following is a tentative list of sites to be visited: "       MARAD Headquarters Washington, DC (2 visits) "       PCS Walnut Creek, CA "       Matson Oakland, CA or Long Beach, CA "       ODI Houston, TX "       PGM Gretna, LA "       CLS Jacksonville, FL "       MTL Jacksonville, FL or Charleston, SC "       Keystone Bala Cynwyd, PA "       IAS Vorhees, NJ "       MLL Norfolk, VA "       ProLog Arlington, VA and/or Virginia Beach, VA STATEMENT OF WORK Item 3.  Follow-on Support.  Ship managers will document and report problems encountered with the application to the MARAD RMS Helpdesk (RMS@dot.gov).  The contractor will provide second-tier technical support to resolve data or procedural issues that cannot be resolved by the Helpdesk. The contractor will provide an e-mail address and phone number (if different from the contractor's normal business phone number(s)) to support submission of technical support requests by the Helpdesk. Within two business days of receiving a request, the contractor will either resolve the issue or inform the MARAD RMS Helpdesk of the projected timeframe for resolution. In the event an issue cannot be resolved within 10 working days, the contractor will advise the COTR in writing and provide the specific cause(s) for the delay and a detailed plan of action for doing so. In all instances, the contractor will inform the MARAD RMS Helpdesk when the issue has been resolved. MARAD reserves the right to penalize the contractor up to ý portion of the monthly maintenance fee in the event the contractor's efforts in resolving support issues are determined to be unsatisfactory. The contractor is responsible for maintaining the application's compatibility with the latest release of NS5 being used by MARAD.  The contractor will also maintain and provide an updated Data Dictionary, and User's Manual to reflect NS5 changes that impact the reporting database. Software Release Notes for subsequent versions are to be provided concurrent with the associated software release. On an annual basis, MARAD will evaluate contractor performance prior to exercising the option for maintenance.  Unsatisfactory performance may result in renegotiating or cancelling follow-on maintenance support. STATEMENT OF WORK Item 4.  Period of Performance "       Item 1 and 2: Contract award plus 120 days. "       Item 3: Four one-year options for maintenance commencing 121 days after contract award. Attachment 2 Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION Management Systems Consulting LLC  (MSC) has developed a NS5 data extraction tool for their commercial clients that meets all MARAD requirements cited in the Statement of Work, including the critical requirements to segregate data visibility by site as well as to prevent access to other Ship Manager's data from unauthorized users.  This product is a proprietary application with the source code wholly owned by MSC and is in use with many clients for varied purposes.  There is no other comparable program available on the market.  The current NS5 database, consisting of 574 tables, is very complex in terms of data relationships. This degree of complexity inhibits the process of creating custom reports and extracts to such an extent that this functionality is out of reach for all typical users.  The currently available MSC product normalizes this complexity and allows for custom reports and extracts to be easily created by MARAD ship managers.  Any effort expended by MARAD to build, or to contract to build, such a customized application involves a very high risk as compared to using one that is already developed, tested, and operationally deployed at a number of large commercial maritime companies.  Furthermore, should MARAD choose to build, or contract to build the subject application, MARAD would be required to support and modify this application as the NS5 software is updated by ABS.  MSC is currently providing this support, as well as being obligated to do so, with their available commercial product.  The use of a commercial software package makes the maximum use of commercial services and off-the-shelf technology required by the Section 5202: Incremental Acquisition of Information Technology of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA Title V), E-Gov Act implementation, and DOT's modernization efforts. The issue of custom database reporting and exports was recently identified by MARAD Ship Managers as their most critical need in terms of using NS5 to support MARAD and execution of their performance-based contracts.  The anticipated payback from acquiring and deploying this tool is considered paramount towards helping meet MAR-610 business objectives and further the agency's push towards becoming the premier Government ship manager.

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 
Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT) has installed Knoll modular furniture in all MARCENT facilities.  The Knoll modular furniture design?s stability and system integrity hinges on the attachment of properly fitted cubicle systems.  In addition, the MARCENT Knoll cubicle system was designed and set-up to maximize the available space within MARCENT.  To conjoin another cubicle system would seriously degrade the entire system and would not allow for the maximum use of available space.  The other option would be to purchase an entire cubicle system which is currently valued at $471K.  Pursuing another cubicle system would not be cost effective nor would it be reasonable when additional Knoll cubicle systems can be purchased for $12K.

<SUBJECT>A -- Industry Advanced Technology Search / Discovery
<DESC>Information Requested on: Advanced Technologies and Ways to Better Discover Advanced Technologies 

Description: US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) is tasked with transforming the joint military force.  Within the United States military, transformation requires changing the form, or structure of our military forces; the nature of our military culture and doctrine supporting those forces; and streamlining our warfighting functions to more effectively meet the complexities of the new threats challenging our nation in this new millennium.

Joint concept development and experimentation is the cornerstone for developing future joint warfighting concepts and capabilities. The Unified Command Plan (UCP) identifies USJFCOM's key role in transforming U.S. military forces. To accomplish this mission, the command develops new concepts and tests them through  experimentation and, in collaboration with other combatant commands, services and agencies, recommends solutions to better integrate their warfighting capabilities. Included within these capabilities are mission areas that run the gamut from major combat operations to peace keeping, nation building, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, while working with the multinational, interagency and non-government organizations (NGOs) in a whole of government approach. The command also collaborates with and builds on best practices from industry and academia.

USJFCOM uses Technology Transfer Authority (TTA) to speed the research and development process. The goal is to quickly develop new ideas from academic, industrial, national and international research laboratories into integrated joint warfighting capabilities. One way USJFCOM uses TTA is by entering into Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADAs) with private companies and other entities, which allow partners to share costs, without exchanging funds. 
The objective of a CRADA is cooperative research that will enhance the mission of the command and benefit the other party. CRADAs define the individual responsibilities of each party and rights to intellectual property developed under the agreement.

Under federal law, the command can establish CRADAs with industrial organizations, industrial development organizations, non-profit organizations, universities, state and local governments. USJFCOM may provide personnel, facilities, and equipment to perform the cooperative research, but may not provide funds to support a CRADA. The other party may provide personnel, facilities, equipment, and funding.

The Advanced Technology Department conducts exploratory efforts with industry, academia, and laboratories to identify opportunities to interface with Joint Concept Development and Experimentation efforts and provides solutions to the joint war fighter.  The Advanced Technology Department is soliciting Industry and Academia's assistance in discovering advanced technologies and assistance in developing better methodologies for discovering technologies that best support improved, "leap-ahead" or revolutionary capabilities to the joint warfighter. Responses to this request for information (RFI) would enable USJFCOM to find those new technologies that show greatest promise to improved capability for the joint war fighter.  In some rare cases, these new capabilities may be simply better or different applications of an existing technology, or integrate technologies in to provide capability.

RFI Guidelines:

USJFCOM will not pay for information provided under this RFI, and there is no guarantee that a war fighter capability will be supported as a result of this RFI. This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance or financial incentives. The purpose of this RFI is solely to solicit input for USJFCOM consideration in determining the most beneficial capabilities for the war fighter, and the most efficient way to discover advanced technologies that will provide advanced and improved capabilities to the joint war fighter.

Comments in response to this RFI should be submitted in Microsoft Word or PDF to tech.transfer@jfcom.mil by 8:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on February 29, 2008. Please provide responses to this RFI in less than a 2 page paper format, or no larger than a 3 MB Powerpoint presentation. Questions relative to responding to this RFI may be sent to this same mailbox in advance of your response, and will be answered via the mailbox only.

Rationale or Justification:

Industry and Academia play a significant role in all technological development in the  United States. Numerous opportunities exist to enhance the efficient use of these new technologies to support the joint war fighter.

USJFCOM would appreciate input from industry, industry associations, academia, academic associations and other entities regarding the most beneficial advanced technologies, and the most efficient ways to discover advanced technologies in order to implement better capabilities for the joint war fighter. How are Disruptive Technologies used, and how they can be used against the US?  Information on the overall level of interest by respondents participating in this program; possible incentives needed to encourage the immediate adoption of best-in-kind advanced technologies; recommendations for technology development or other support needed to achieve this goal; and other factors, critical for meeting this goal, that should be considered to ensure strong industry and academia participation are requested.
Please consider the list of topics below in your response. You may also wish to consider issues that you believe are relevant to improving capabilities for our joint war fighters.

- Experience or lessons learned from searching/discovery of advance technologies.

- Challenges, pitfalls (what not to do) learned from these activities.

- Roadblocks and concerns that industry and academia may have learned from searching / discovery of advanced technologies.

- What is the most beneficial means to manage innovation to answer operational requirements?

- The most effective way(s) to motivate industry and academia to participate in this initiative, including possible incentives.

- How to document and verify the industrial and academia search / discovery and to evaluate the success of these programs.

- The level of interest in participating in the planning or in partnering with the USJFCOM to achieve this goal.

- Specific technical or technology metrics to support assessment of search / discovery means.

In summary, please provide comments to aid and inform USJFCOM in the creation of an advanced technologies search / discovery program; please provide any advanced technologies for consideration for cooperative research and development into capabilities to support the joint war fighter.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 05 February 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 04 February 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Primary point of contact is Dennis Gaines (252) 335-6713.  Alternate contact is Sherri Roche (252) 335-6566.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>BLAST BOXES

The 96 Contracting Squadron, 96 CONS/MSCB at Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit and award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for 2 steel blast boxes to be constructed from normalized 4340 steel grade material. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quotation is being requested, and a written request for quotation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) F1TBAM7338A001-A. This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 332710, with small business standard size of 500 employees. Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This requirement is for the following. 

CLIN 0001: Two (2) each, LARGE BLAST BOX, in accordance with specifications and drawings. Specify delivery date for this CLIN.
CLIN 0002: Two (2) each, SMALL BLAST BOX, in accordance with specifications and drawings. Specify delivery date for this CLIN.

CLIN 0001 must be delivered first.

SPECIFICATIONS are as follows: 

The two steel blast boxes shall be constructed from normalized 4340 steel grade material. The two blastboxes are distinguished as large or small pertaining to the opening created once assembled. Each blastbox is constructed of four walls and four edges designed to mate together as slip fits with little room for movement between adjoining parts. 

Walls:

There are two walls designated long and short to distinguish them. The long wall has overall dimensions of 95?X24?X3? whereas the short wall has overall dimensions of 41.75?X24?X3?. The vendor will cut slots from their 3? depth so they can accept the edges needed to complete the blastbox assembly. The vendor will tap and drill two holes so that the walls can be lifted and moved into place.

Edges:

There are two edges designated long and short to distinguish them. For the large box, the long edge has overall dimensions of 81.5?X6?X11.44? and overall dimensions of 25.38?X6?X11.44? for the short edge. To complete assembly of the box two of each edge will need to be constructed.

The edges for the small box has overall dimensions of 54.88?X6?X11.44? for its long edge and overall dimensions of 25.38?X6?X11.44? for its short edge. To complete assembly of the box two of each edge will need to be constructed.

Construction:

The vendor shall perform manufacturing processes without dramatically altering the material properties of the normalized 4340 steel material, i.e. torching shouldn?t be considered. It is important that material properties be kept consistent from start to finish as much as possible. Tolerances for dimensions shall be held to the hundredths. 

Shipping:

FOB Destination. 

Drawings are available upon request. Please send requests for the drawings to Ms. Mary Gardner, mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil or to Ms. Manivanh Mundy, manivanh.mundy@eglin.af.mil .

The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government?s best interest to do so.

You may send a quote for one line item or for both.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 3 is to provide clarification on the Statement of Work regarding staffing and pricing and to extend the deadline for proposals. Proposals are no longer due by 5:00 pm EST on January 22, 2008 but instead will be due by noon EST on Wednesday, January 30, 2008.

From the SOW:
The educational program must have a minimum of five years (5) experience in providing emergency medical courses at or above the First Responder level, with no less than five (5) full time faculty and no less than four (4) instructors available to teach the USSS Specific Emergency Service Responder Course. 
Clarification: 
USSS anticipates that only one instructor will be on-site and when that instructor is on-site, the instructor will be teaching or preparing to teach. If the vendor is neither teaching nor preparing to teach, USSS does not expect any instructor to be on-site at JJRTC. USSS requires the specified number of instructors because USSS will review resumes of relevant instructors; the vendor is to have a bank or pool of instructors to draw from.

From the SOW:
Specific Tasks: 1. Curriculum Development through 6. JJRTC Staff Support
Clarification: 
It is anticipated that these Specific Tasks will be performed by the instructors. 

From the SOW:
The Emergency Services Responder course is part of two programs, one program is 17 weeks long and the other is 13 weeks long. Each fiscal year USSS anticipates holding approximately 16 of these 17- or 13-week programs. Thus, 16 ESR courses are to be taught. The Emergency Services Responder course is 40 hours of class time. The 40 hours to be taught will encompass nine specific classes (i.e., lessons). Each 40 hour ESR course will be scheduled randomly as space and time permit at JJRTC and may run over several months or may occur in a period of one week. Some of the ESR courses may overlap, for example, the sixth, seventh and eighth week of either program may mean first, second and third classes of the ESR course will all be held on the same day.
Clarification: 
The 40 hours of class time will be scheduled randomly; there is no block of 40 hours of classroom time. Each of the 16 ESR courses will have 40 hours of classroom time, but that 40 hours will not run consecutively. USSS expects to have a draft timetable four weeks in advance. Generally, USSS will have determined the exact dates and hours of class time 17 days ahead. 

Solicitation Format for Proposal: 
Part A. Pricing - the offeror shall provide a unit price and a total price for each line item:
0001 Base Period: FY2008: Provide sixteen (16) Emergency Services First Responder Courses (pro rated for the base period)
Clarification:
The vendor is to provide a price for each course for each Fiscal Year, meaning for each line item. For example, for 0001, the vendor is to provide a per course price and a total price for FY2008 which will be the per course price multiplied by 16. USSS, based on the award date, will pro rate the number of courses needed for FY2008. (Note that each course is for 40 hours of class time.)

Attachment (Amendment 1 adds attachment only):
Justification for Brand Name Product or Feature Unique to a Single Manufacturer

1.	The OCCs requirement described in Requisition 84022 requires a particular brand name product or feature for reasons indicated below:

2.	Restricted to the following brand name: Symantec Backup Exec.	

3.	Description of the brand name, product or feature unique to a single manufacturer:
The following products are required based on the OCC?s current disaster recovery infrastructure.  
a. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Agent for Windows System  W/Symantec Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows Servers and CPA-Essential Support  1 server

l. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Remote Agent for NetWare Servers - Essential Support (1 year) - 1 server 
	
4.	Specific salient characteristics of the brand name, product or feature that are required to satisfy the Agency?s needs: 

a. This is the only brand name that can fulfill the Agency?s needs since the Agencys developed its disaster recovery infrastructure around the Symantec (Veritas / Seagate) Backup Exec since 1997.  As a result, the only product compatible to the OCC infrastructure is Symantec Backup Exec.  This structure allows the Agency the capability to protect applications, user data and operating system files throughout the enterprise.  

5.	Describe the market research that was performed.  What other similar products or features of products available from other companies were considered and why are the similar products or features unable to satisfy the Agencys needs.  

a. The product must be able to interconnect with an existing system/infrastructure and only Symantec Backup Exec provides the form, fit, and function compatibility based on a review of interface information of all commercially available similar products.  This is based on information provided by knowledgeable individuals in the Government regarding market capabilities to meet requirements. 

 
I have reviewed the circumstances of this justification for a brand name product or feature unique to a single manufacturer and certify that item required meets the Governments minimum needs and no other course of action will satisfy the Governments requirement.

Technical Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this Brand Name Justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Program Manager:   SIGNATURE: /s/ Paul Marshman 1/24/08
