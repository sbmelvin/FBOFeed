This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>This announcement is an RFI and is for planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information requested herein will be used within the Army/DoD to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. This restriction does not limit the government's right to use information contained in these data sources if it has been obtained from another source without restriction. A contract may not be awarded as a result of this RFI.  <br>  <br> The US Army Contracting Command, Fort Dix, NJ, on behalf of U.S. Army Logistics Innovation Agency (LIA) is interested in gathering information to further its understanding of the current available technology that could enhance the Army's Logistics Business Process by improving the current unit level Change of Command Inventory business processes. An army unit has 30 days to complete this inventory and LIA is exploring ways to decrease the amount to as few as 3 days by use of a more advanced technology rather than the legacy manual and/or barcode methodology. This technology must have the capability of increasing asset visibility and decreasing time and needed resources to conduct these inventories.  <br>  <br> Technology of interest is the Passive Radio Frequency Identification (pRFID) tags and labels. The pRFID must be applied to selected equipment (200 major end items with 3,000 associated components) within an Army unit.  Vendor must provide: subject matter expertise in the recommendation of AIT device selected, placement, installation, code pRFID with unit data from the Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE) operating system, and testing; have experience with various types of Army equipment and associated components, technical manuals, supply catalogs; have experience in Army property accountability and inventory procedures and regulatory guidance; provide the Intermec IP30 RFID reader, pRFID tags and labels, RFID printer, materials needed to affix pRFID to assets; MIDDLEWARE APPLICATION; ability to download the IP30 RFID Scanner firmware and RFID Resource Kit from equipment vendor's website. In addition to the use of pRFID, the Army's PBUSE operating system will be used as the property management system. A thorough working knowledge of this system is required. The PBUSE system currently has an Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) kit associated with it.  Components include the Intermec CK61 Scanner with docking station and the Intermec PM4I printer.  The goal is to add an Intermec IP30 RFID reader to the CK61 allowing RFID read capability.  Middleware software will be required in order for the CK61 to interface with the current PBUSE software  loaded on the scanner. This middleware should transfer PBUSE data into a pRFID standard format. This data will then be transferred to the CK61 via the docking station. This middleware software must NOT interfere with the current operating procedures but only enhance the ability to read RFID tags and labels.  <br>   <br> This project will include multiple Test Case Demonstration to stakeholders and VIPs and a six month observation period used to assess the durability of the applied pRFID.  Replacement/maintance of contractor inoperable pRFID will be required. <br>    <br> It is requested that your firm submit a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages, single spaced, 11 minimum font size) demonstrating an ability to provide the capabilities identified above. A generic capability statement is not acceptable.  The capabilities statement package should be sent via e-mail to:  antonio.j.keyes.civ@mail.mil no later than 10 June 2013, 1630 EST. <br>  <br> This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or any obligation on behalf of the Government.  The responses to this RFI are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No contract award will be made on the basis of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information.

This work entails but is not limited to the following: 1) the removal and replacement of all ballast, timber ties, and rail necessary to install a new waterproof decking system, 2) the inspection of hidden portions of the girders after the deck removal, 3) repair of structural damage found during inspections, and 4) safety improvements such as the addition of a walkway and handrails.  <br>  <br> The secondary purpose is a bid option to remove dead weight along with providing corrosion prevention and inspection access to Spans 1-5, approximately 525', on Railroad Bridge Structure 229. The work entails removing rail ballast and the underlying timber deck to include the subsequent installation of a new safety walkway system with ballast curb.  <br>  <br> This is a Design-build project and the Contractor is solely responsible for the design and construction.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, material, and equipment to perform the work.  <br>  <br> Anticipated solicitation issue date is June 4, 2013.

NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.   <br>  <br> The US Army Contracting Command-Redstone has a requirement for a follow-on one year contract with option line items, and an additional option year, to be awarded in fiscal year 2014 for PBL and Sustainment/Operational Support for the TUAS (Shadow(R)) Program.  It is anticipated that the follow-on one year contract will have a period of performance of 1 Nov 13 - 31 Oct 14 and will have an option year with an anticipated period of performance of 1 Nov 14 - 31 Oct 15.  The follow-on contract, and anticipated option year, will be for a performance based contractor managed supply and maintenance effort that consists of field supply support, depot level supply support, depot-level maintenance, software support, total package fielding, sustainment training, field service support, field service operations, sustainment management, PBL engineering and management, depot material repair and management, and post deployment software support.  The Sustainment/Operational Support will consist of Brigade Integration Training (BIT), New Equipment Training (NET), Presets, Resets, Government Owned Contractor Operated teams in theater, and contractor augmentation teams in theater.   <br>  <br> The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 United States Code 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) (B).  The proposed acquisition of this effort is directly related to the ongoing and future work being performed by the Shadow(R) prime contractor, AAI Corporation, York Road and Industry Lane, Hunt Valley, MD  21030, CAGE CODE 97384.  This requirement must be restricted for the following reasons: 1) AAI Corporation is the only source with the corporate knowledge, expertise, and facilities to execute all basic sustainment requirements for the TUAS (Shadow(R)) Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program, 2) Many of the components of the TUAS (Shadow(R)) are proprietary, and the Government does not currently own a complete Technical Data Package suitable for full and open competition, 3) The technology is state of the art and duplication of the effort would require lengthy development and would impact the TUAS (Shadow(R)) readiness rate.  <br>  <br> Firms that recognize and can provide the required PBL and Sustainment/Operational Support for the TUAS (Shadow(R)) Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program are encouraged to identify themselves via mail or fax.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement and proposal which shall be considered.   <br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
FAR Parts 12 and 13 are being utilized and any language used must be interpreted with the view that all line items are commercial items (Part 12) and the simplified acquisition (Part 13) rules are being utilized despite any use of terms that might indicate that Part 14 or Part 15 is being used. Additionally, other than Part 12 or 13 provisions and clauses may be used when required or allowed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR)(i.e. Part 41 Utilities, Part 36 Services, etc.) or when the clauses or provisions are being utilized in the commercial open market and are beneficial to the government and the contractor (Authority - see FAR 12.301(e) "supplemental clauses") and FAR 12.302(a) "tailoring clauses"); even though these provisions and clauses may be from different parts of the FAR. For example: FAR Parts 12 and 13 provisions and clauses may be supplemented by Part 36 (construction), Part 15 (Negotiation), Part 14 (Sealed Bidding), and etc. provisions and clauses when they're used in the open commercial market or otherwise required by the FAR.
All FAR required clauses and provisions are incorporated into the purchase order and solicitation, even if not listed in the purchase order or solicitation.

The quote must contain all of the following information:
1.	Quotes shall include company TAX ID Number, DUNS Number (always applicable), and be registered on the System for Award Management (S.A.M.) website (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ ).

2.	All applicable taxes and fees (i.e. TERO, sales, etc.) must be included in the quote.
3.	All vendors must be enrolled on the Internet Payment Platform (IPP). Enrollment can be accomplished at https://www.ipp.gov/. Note, ALL information (bank account #, etc.) must be current in the system or the contract officer will rule that the vendor is non-responsive and move onto the next listed vendor.
4.	Vendors must provide all contact information on the quote. The information that must be included is: phone numbers, contact names, email address for which to send a purchase order, and any other applicable information that would benefit the contracting officer.
5.	Page layout - no more than 10 pages will be accepted, the font size shall not be any smaller than 12, and the page margins shall not be any less than 0.5 on any side.
6.	The quote should be good for 30 calendar days after close of solicitation (exceptions: propane, diesel, etc.).
7.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Mailstop A19, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract to SAP Government Support and Services Inc D.B.A.: SAP National Security Services 6903 Rockledge Drive, 10th Floor, Bethsaida, MD 20817 to provide Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) Optimization Assessment.
<p>Posting Date: 05/20/2013</p>
<p>Closing Response Date: 11:59 pm EST on 06/04/2013</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 541519</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 07/12/2013 to 09/06/2013</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: 2013-Q-15443</p>
<p>Contract Line Item Number: 0001</p>
<p>Contract Place of Performance: 1600 Clifton Road NE, Building 24 Atlanta, GA 30329</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). Determining how to optimize VTrckS is important as the system is further deployed to states.  The optimization validation and identified strategy will prevent negative impacts to the VTrckS Project as the system is rolled out to high volume grantees and their health care providers, which are slated to begin deployment in March 2013.  The optimization strategy will also provide mitigation solutions to address challenges involving slowness of some of the system components that were surfaced during previous deployment efforts and will ultimately help to ensure the VTrckS investment meets the business needs of the Federal Government. Because of their in depth historical knowledge of the system and time constraints, SAP National Security Services is positioned to be the contractor that can quickly conduct the assessment and provide CDC the needed findings in the required time frame.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency for future procurement. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Michael Harwell, Contracting Specialist, Reference 2013-Q-15443, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Michael Harwell, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>This is a posting of a sole source award to Applied Biosystems and is not a request for competition.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong>:
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement</strong>:</p>
<p>1. HiSeq 2500, Catalog Number: SY-401-2501, Quantity: One (1). <br />2. Shipping and Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for NISC services. NISC currently has three (3) MiSeq Systems, three (3) Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx, and three (3) HiSeq 2000 Systems which are proven platforms for genetic analysis and functional genomics. This instrument's parallel sequencing technology leverages clonal cluster formation and proprietary reversible terminator chemistry to give it the speed and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing to generate billions of bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run. The HiSeq 2500 is compatible with the existing MiSeq, Cbot Cluster, Genome Analyzer IIx and the HiSeq 2000 that are currently being used in the Sequencing Center. Maintaining compatibility is a must and essential.</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 System provides ultra-high output and speed. In a single run one is able to sequence more than 5 human genomes at ~30x coverage. The HiSeq 2500 system is able to process a diverse set of samples within one flow cell, and with the highest data quality currently available. Another key factor in this selection is that this instrument is able to run in an alternate rapid mode which would allow the researchers to decrease turnaround time by many weeks. This is a critical consideration for projects impacting patient diagnosis. The HiSeq 2500 can be switched between a high throughput mode and rapid turnaround run mode. In high throughput run mode, similar to the HiSeq 2000, the HiSeq 2500 enables sequencing of a large number of genomes, exomes, or transcriptomes in a single run, allowing large studies to be completed with the fewest number of runs. In rapid run mode, the HiSeq 2500 is capable of sequencing a 30x genome in a day or completing fast multiplexed applications such as exome resequencing or RNA-Seq. The rapid run time includes automated, on-instrument cluster generation, and paired-end sequencing, with no user intervention needed throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 also allows researchers to process samples by a single method that is compatible with HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 2500. This simplifies the NISC lab processes, minimizing labor and equipment costs, and gives researchers the flexibility to route samples to either machine type depending on the needs of the project and machine availability. The high speed of the HiSeq 2500, means that reagents sit out for a shorter period of time and decay to a lesser degree during the run. The result is longer, more accurate reads (300 vs 200 bases). This allows NISC to expand the sequencing applications supported on this platform, as some supplications require longer reads.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span></strong>:<br />Delivery of HiSeq 2500 will be delivered within 6-weeks of receiving the approved contract award.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br /></span></strong><br />The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium. <br />While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. When an investigator wishes to study only selected genes or genomic regions it is more cost-effective and efficient to perform targeted sequencing. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong></span>:<br /><br />&bull; Must be able to run the same chemistry as HiSeq 2000, MiSeq, and Genome Analyzer IIx Systems.<br />&bull; Run time for 200 base run must be under 30 hours.<br />&bull; Data should be able to be processed through NISC's data analysis software.<br />&bull; Preparation time for samples to load on the sequencer should take about a day.<br />&bull; Read length at least 150 bp.<br />&bull; Produce paired-end reads of 60 million per run.<br />&bull; Reagents are in convenient volumes and are ready-to-load.<br />&bull; Oil is not required for the optics.<br />&bull; Straightforward protocols that require no beads or emulsions.<br />&bull; System should be able to perform amplification, sequencing and data analysis in one unit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Responsibilities</span></strong>:<br />Not applicable</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</span></strong>:<br />Not Applicable</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong>:
<p><br /><strong>This is a Follow-On Service Contract Renewal.</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, New York 10594-1939 to procure a Service Agreement Contract for a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Stand Mot for NHGRI, Cytogenetics and Microscopy Core.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The following system for this service contract renewal for 12-Months</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1. Axio Observer Z1 Stand Mot, Serial Number: 3834002479:<br />&bull; Spinning Disk Unit CSU-XIA 5000, Quantity: One (1) Each;<br />&bull; Nosepiece 6x MOT w/Definite Focus, Quantity: One (1) Each;<br />&bull; AxioCam MRm Rev.3 with FireWire, Quantity: Two (2) Each;<br />&bull; Scanning Stage 130x100 DC, Quantity: One (1) Each;<br />&bull; Incubator S TIRF DARK S1, Quantity: One (1) Each; and<br />&bull; Imaging Analysis Workstation (R650), Quantity: One (1) Each.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), The Cytogenetics and Microscopy Core's mission is to provide NHGRI investigators access to imaging and cytogenetics resources that support and extend their abilities to discover the causes of disease and the mechanisms of normal development and physiology. The Core performs fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of DNA clones, facilitating the visualization of defined nucleic acid sequences at the cellular and subcellular levels. Services include standard FISH mapping on high-resolution banded metaphase chromosomes (using G-banding or DAPI-banding); analyses of clones containing human, mouse, and other species' DNA; and high-resolution mapping of clones on extended chromatin structures.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span></strong>:<br /><br />This Purchase Order will have a base for 12-Months and two (2) Option Periods.</p>
<p>Base: June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014<br />Option Period 1: June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015<br />Option Period 2: June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JUSTIFICATION:</span></strong></p>
<p>NHGRI uses both Microscopes throughout the institute and there is an important need to ensure this equipment is operational at all times. The Service Agreements allows for quick repair if needed and regular maintenance work to ensure continued use of the equipment. The Spinning Disc Microscope is a very sophisticated piece of equipment that enables investigators to make experiments base on Fluorescent Recovery After Photo-bleaching (FRAP). Core users can perform FRAP not only on very fast moving proteins but also on slow moving DNA repairing proteins complexes as well. Another unique feature is the 4D-stitching module that allow Core users to image entire zebra fish embryos (tiling mode) in XY and Z and over long periods of time (a week). Once collected the Carl Zeiss software is able to stitch together thousands of images to give the Core user a 4D movie for data-analysis. TIRF give the Core users the highest possible out-of-focus discrimination (contrast), the highest z-resolution, highest sensitivity for low light imaging. With these tools the Core users can measure cell adhesion site with crystal clear clarity and resolution, image vesicles undergoing endocytosis or exocytosis with very high speeds, perform cell-to-cell interactions with high sensitivity and precision, and perform single molecule imaging with ultimate background suppression. It is very important to maximize the use of this expensive piece of equipment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</span></strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<p>In prior years, a commercial version of the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) was modified and developed to create an "AFTAC Specific CAMx" tool to evaluate photochemical transport and diffusion model to gain insight into ambient characterization of the environment. Specifically, the software allows for integrated assessment of gaseous and particulate air-pollution over many scales ranging from urban to super-regional. The software contains a modular architecture which facilitates adaptability of other applications, multi-platform configuration, and state-of-the-art photochemistry and transport and diffusion algorithms. Modifications to the software require the developer to apply the model to ambient characterization of selected field test and site locations, and provide field tests and experiments. Software input/output file formats are based on the Urban Air shed Model, and are therefore compatible with many existing pre- and post-processing tools.<br /><br />Contract actions require the ability to:</p>
<p>1. Provide development of CAMx and Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).<br />2. Provide photochemical kinetics technical support.<br />3. Provide test, evaluation, enhancements, and support for air quality systems.<br />4. Provide CAMx modeling of tracer experiments.<br />5. Provide analysis of data from field test experiments.<br />6.

This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to more efficient and effective solutions for environmental compliance concerns across the Air Force and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Environmental Compliance and Pollution Prevention Programs. This solicitation is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e., a service). The Environmental Quality Program areas of need for this announcement are:</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 135%; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 135%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">a. Hazardous Materials: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies or methodologies to remove or treat Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) from Aqueous Fire Fighting Foam (AFFF). The Air Force has excess AFFF stockpiles that contains between 3 to 6% PFOA/PFOS. Proposals need to develop a cost effective mechanism to remove or treat PFOA/PFOS from the AFFF to reduce disposal costs for the Air Force while transitioning to new formations of AFFF that do not contain PFOA or PFOS. Current destruction of AFFF is through incineration which is expensive to the Air Force.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 135%; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 135%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">b. Industrial Wastewater Treatment: Proposals should identify new or innovative industrial wastewater treatment technologies for recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewater treatment plants. Example installations are Robbins AFB and Hill AFB.</span></p>

Stormwater Modeling Techniques: Proposals should identify installation-wide watershed modeling approaches that enable base facility engineers to maintain compliance with Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) section 438. Each base has industrial stormwater permit that requires best management practices to eliminate illicit discharges to waters of the United States. Example of best management practices include but not limited to use energy efficient low maintenance technologies to reuse stormwater from roofs, parking lots, runways and other impervious surfaces. Additionally, mission requirements identify and manage the reduction of flooding conditions. Air Force does not want to build retention and detention systems for projects. Priority will be given to proposals that do not use continuous simulation techniques.</span></p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />TSD Use of Waterborne Transportation Data<br />Reporting Service</p>
<p>Introduction <br />The mission of the Transportation Services Division (TSD) is to provide insightful agricultural transportation information and analysis to help move agricultural products to market. As part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the TSD informs, represents, and assists agricultural shippers and government policymakers through: market reports, regulatory representation, economic analysis, technical assistance, stakeholder outreach, and responding to inquiries. One of TSD's objectives is to develop new market reports and expand current reports to include the movement of high-valued agricultural products, particularly those moved in marine shipping containers (hereafter referred to as containers). To better develop these reports and other in-depth analyses, TSD is requiring up-to-date waterborne transportation data for the agricultural transportation market.</p>
<p>Historically, TSD has not been able to find a competitor for the transaction level transportation data it currently purchases. These data show all waterborne movements of agricultural products, including those moved in containers, to the level of detail needed for TSD's reporting and analyses. TSD uses these data to determine transportation flow information of waterborne agricultural imports and exports. These data are used on a quarterly basis to report movements of containerized agricultural products and the shipping line market share in the Ocean Rate Bulletin. Additionally, these data are extensively used for internal reporting to USDA policy officials during transportation disruptions at U.S. ports such as labor disputes, congestion, and natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods.</p>
<p>Detailed transaction level transportation data is often not included in official trade data. Information such as whether the commodities were moved in a container is limited in the official U.S government trade data. Additionally, detailed Harmonized Tariff (HTS) Code commodity categorizations for export and import movements are often restricted in transportation datasets to simply a 2-digit level, which is insufficient for TSD reporting. We require 6-digit specificity, or greater. For continuity and consistency in reporting, TSD requires comparable detailed level data be provided. This requirement also ensures consistency with the historical databases we maintain and use.</p>
<p>Scope of Work <br />The data supplier should provide TSD with consistent and accurate monthly agricultural waterborne transportation data for one year. The data should be at the transaction level (compiled from the bills of lading and manifests) that will allow TSD to develop multiple transportation analyses on different commodities, in different trade lanes, during specified times of the year or month. The data should be delivered within 2 months or sooner of the actual shipment activity. Data taken directly from the Bills of Lading and Manifests allow for more comprehensive transportation level detail of the commercial transaction. TSD must be allowed to publish the purchased data in any format it deems necessary to service the agricultural shipper community and USDA policy officials. All waterborne agricultural movements must be included, such as bulk, break-bulk, tanker, and container movements. More specific requirements of these data are listed below.</p>
<p>Requirements of the Data <br />TSD requires...<br />Transaction level agricultural transportation data that includes: <br />&bull; At least a 6-digit Harmonized Tariff (HTS) Code-for identifying specific commodities. Many datasets provide a 2-digit HTS Code, but this is not detailed enough for our analysis. Searching through commodity descriptions to find specific commodities is laborious and leaves abundant room for error. <br />&bull; The date cargo departs from or arrives in the United States.<br />&bull; The date vessel arrives at the port.<br />&bull; Container indication for the shipment.<br />&bull; TEU count, twenty-foot equivalent units. <br />&bull; Size of container used to transport the cargo.<br />&bull; Refrigerated commodity indication.<br />&bull; Name of the ocean carrier company moving the cargo.<br />&bull; Country origin and destination of the cargo.<br />&bull; City origin and destination of the cargo.<br />&bull; Origin and destination ocean ports.<br />&bull; Transshipment port-the port where cargo is moved from one vessel to another before being moved to its final ocean destination port. <br />&bull; Name and address of the shippers and buyers involved in the commercial transaction including any third party logistics providers used to facilitate the transaction.<br />&bull; Weight of the cargo in consistent units of measure (preferably in pounds).<br />&bull; Value of the cargo shipment.<br />&bull; The data must undergo vigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy. These measures should include at least monthly audits of the data against U.S. Customs vessel arrival and departure lists as well as industry verification of the shipments. The company goes to extra efforts to resolve data discrepancies by comparing the datasets with original documentation or official government data. Data updates and corrections are incorporated in the final dataset in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Format: The format TSD receives the data is very important to allow for flexibility in developing several different kinds of reports. Access to the raw, transaction level agricultural data is important to allow TSD to see each movement and aggregate the data to the level at which the circumstances or market conditions demand.</p>
<p>TSD must receive the data in a format such as .dbf or .xls that is easily converted into our existing Microsoft Access and SAS databases. Datasets should be delivered via email or, in the case of a larger dataset, a CD/DVD should be used due to email capacity constraints. TSD employees are not allowed to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) systems to transfer files though many data companies prefer this method.</p>
<p>Specific TSD Reporting Venues That Currently Use Waterborne Transportation Data<br />TSD currently uses waterborne agricultural transportation data to analyze the movement of agricultural products to and from overseas markets. Below is a list of reports TSD produces using these data.</p>
<p>Transportation Disruption Reporting<br />Hurricane Reporting: Since 2006, TSD has each year developed a briefing book for the Administrator that describes the use of hurricane prone ports in moving U.S. agricultural trade. Each report describes the movement of these agricultural commodities moved through ocean ports, as defined by TSD, on an annual basis. Major commodities are described for both import and export movements as well as transportation details such as the type of vessel used, the use of containers, and if the products are moved using refrigeration. Additionally, TSD provides the names of the shipping lines and their market share for the agricultural commodities moved through particular ports. Finally, the country origins and destinations are provided. These data provide USDA analysts and policymakers an overview of the agricultural significance of the ports in the potential path of a hurricane. When a significant hurricane hits the United States, TSD does further data analysis on specific commodities based on the effects of the storm.</p>
<p>Other Disruption Reporting: In addition to the Hurricane Reporting, other disruptions to the transportation system, such as floods, oil spills, congestion, labor disputes, terrorist attacks, and other natural disasters, require the use of waterborne transportation data to analyze its affect on the agricultural community.</p>
<p>Regular Market Reports <br />Grain Transportation Report: A weekly reporting of the latest volume and price movement data for barges, railroads, trucks, and ocean vessels involved in the transport of grain. Containerization has become a growing alternative to bulk movements of grain to export markets. TSD uses waterborne transportation data to analyze the market dynamics for moving grains in containers as well as identifying destination markets for these products. HTS Codes are used to clearly define containerized grain movements.</p>
<p>Mexico Transport Cost Indicator Report: A quarterly publication that provides a snapshot of the agricultural transportation traffic between the U.S. and Mexico. It includes information about grain, soybeans, livestock, fruit, vegetables, and container shipments. Waterborne transportation data are used to develop a detailed look at how U.S. agricultural products are transported to Mexico. Data elements include U.S. ports and port regions, Mexico ports, commodities, commodities using bulk vessels, and those moved in containers.</p>
<p>The Importance of Waterways to U.S. Agriculture: Approximately four times per year, TSD updates an online report that highlights the importance of the U.S. waterway system to agricultural movements. In this report, TSD uses waterborne transportation data to determine how much agricultural trade is moved by water. Additionally, it shows the breakdown of the ocean ports used to move both import and export agricultural products. It also shows the use of containers to move major commodity groups to different regions of the world.</p>
<p>Ocean Rate Bulletin: The Ocean Rate Bulletin uses waterborne transportation data to determine shipping line market share for 18 different agricultural commodities and moved in more than 50 popular commodity-trade lane combinations. This report allows shippers to know which carriers to contact when looking to move agricultural commodities in a particular trade lane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assistance to Other USDA Agencies</p>
<p>Other USDA agencies often ask TSD to provide business specific information for particular commodities. Some agencies use these data for compliance purposes; others use them to broaden their scope of knowledge of the commodity specific industry over which they regulate.<br />Quote Due Date, Time and Format</p>
<p>Quotes and all documentation are due via email or mail no later than 2:00 PM CDT on May 28, 2013.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

Front and rear cover slip sheets identifies binder for use with safety data sheets. Included 36" chain attaches binder to rack. Mounting hardware included. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-0359<br />Name:		Binder with Wire Rack Holder, GHS, Safety Data Sheets<br />Description:	Safety Data Sheet organizer based on new Global Harmonized System with wall mount rack to hold binder. 2" binder includes heavy duty A-Z indexing tabs.

Front and rear cover slip sheets identifies this organizer for use with safety data sheets. Does not include a wire rack holder or wall mount. UOI is EA.</p>
<p><br />Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-00-NIB-0357<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	6AV66; Brady 2010; 15Y927; 8UP12; 8Y603; 4ARL5</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-00-NIB-0358<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	10X326; GHS1002</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-00-NIB-0359<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	15Y931; RK085A</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-00-NIB-0360<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	3ZM63; 5U605; 55101520</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 4, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source to EDAX.  This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes.
A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Friday June 7, 2013 by sending an e-mail to valarie_reinholz@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 1 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to: COMPANY: EDAX Incorporated   DUNS: 011655375   NAICS:  334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing  The proposed action will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. AUTHORITY: 8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because: The US Fish & Wildlife National Forensic Lab is need of a replacement EDAX Eagle II XRF, Orbis PC Elemental Analyzer System. The EDAX Orbis instrument has a dual capability of a small spot analysis and a large spot for bulk analysis.  Both of these capabilities are desirable for the varied sample types that we receive in case submissions. The EDAX Orbis is a replacement for an instrument manufactured by the same company, and, therefore, uses the same type of software.  All data stored on the current EDAX system is in a proprietary format. For compatibility of the data in future analyses, the Laboratory requires that the XRF upgrade be EDAX equipment.  The Orbis Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) allows a much higher resolution than the standard Silicon-lithium Si/Li detector.  The EDAX ORBIS is manufactured in the US.  The EDAX system is in a proprietary format which we use in daily casework and has a much higher resolution than the standard Si/Li detector.  The EDAX System which has the Orbis Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) is the only one that has such a high resolution which is needed in case work.  US Fish & Wildlife intends to purchase this item to maintain continuity of tests and casework and software generated around this particular machine. New baselines would be required and peripheral equipment would require recalibration with a different analyzer.

<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Acadia Optronics of Rockville, MD for the SURF III Maintenance and Upgrade Services for Ultraviolet Radiation Group of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the Ultraviolet Radiation Group is to provide the foundation for metrology and testing in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region of the spectrum. This includes the maintenance and continuous improvement of the national primary standards for UV radiation in support of UV-based science and applications and the development of improved measurement and testing techniques for various scientific and industrial applications involving UV radiation.</p>
<p>In order for NIST to remain at the forefront of this very important area of active research, and to be able to compete with a growing number of international facilities, the SURF III facility must be upgraded and continually maintained at optimal operation. The synchrotron upgrades will improve NIST's ability to serve the needs of the scientific and industrial communities, as well as benefiting other important research activities at SURF III such as absolute cryogenic radiometry, standard light source development, and NASA and NOAA satellite calibrations.</p>
<p>Acadia Optronics is the sole servicer of the SURF III system as they are uniquely qualified in having the necessary knowledge and experience with direct work and hardware design under the SURF III system. They are currently under contract SB1341-08-SE-0253 for similar services to the SURF III system. This Contract expires September 30, 2013. Acadia has built custom electron beam current monitors, analyzed the cooling system and implemented changes of the SURF III to prevent catastrophic damages to the system, studied the ring injection system, direct work on the high current magnet supply, and resolves technical issues as they arise. This expertise is unique in manner and only Acadia Optronics is fully capable of ensuring the SURF III operates at its full potential on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The PML SURF III would incur substantial penalties in time and personnel resources if required to removed barriers to competition for acquisition of the services required.</p>
<p>As a result, Acadia Optronics is uniquely qualified to provide the services required for the SURF III upgrade and maintenance. <br />No other companies The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 541990, with a size standard of $14 million dollars.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information, Electronic Manifest (e-Manifest) System
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:austin.bradley@epa.gov">Bradley R. Austin, Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input related to initial planning for a future electronic manifest (e-Manifest) system, as described and authorized by the "Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act" (hereinafter "The Act").  The Act may be found at http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.710:.  This RFI builds on EPA?s previous RFI, located at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/emanifest/index.htm, by seeking additional information about existing solutions for system implementation and funding scenarios.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks industry comments in the following areas: (1) EPA seeks to determine if an existing commercial e-Manifest system is available or can be adapted for use by the EPA as the national standard for tracking and transporting hazardous materials as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  In the alternative, if a commercial system is not available, EPA is looking for creative solutions from industry to address the need for an EPA electronic manifest system; and (2) EPA seeks industry comments regarding the Agency?s proposed solutions to the significant funding challenge associated with the e-Manifest initiative and industry?s proposed solution(s) to the issue.    II. Background Under ? 3002(a)(5) of RCRA, EPA has the authority to require a manifest system and other reasonable means to track hazardous waste shipments.  The current hazardous waste manifest (EPA Form 8700-22) plays a crucial part in the so-called ?cradle-to-grave? RCRA management system for hazardous waste.  The manifest allows all parties involved in hazardous waste management (e.g., generators, transporters, TSDFs, EPA, state agencies) to track the movement of hazardous waste from the generator?s site to the site where the waste will be treated, stored, or disposed.
On October 5, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act, which amended RCRA to direct the EPA Administrator to establish a hazardous waste electronic manifest system.  The Act states the Administrator shall establish an e-Manifest system to be used by any user, as defined in the Act and by EPA.
The current paper-based manifest system is inefficient and states and industry stakeholders incur substantial costs to comply with the current requirements to complete, carry, sign, file and mail paper manifest copies.  The electronic system will establish an alternative to the current paper-based manifest system and is expected to be funded by a combination of appropriated dollars and the collection of fees from users of the system as appropriated by Congress to the EPA.  The EPA Administrator will collect the fees from the users in advance of, or as reimbursement for, the provision by the Administrator of system-related services.  However, EPA?s access to user fee revenue will not be available until fiscal year 2015-2016 and will be governed by fiscal year appropriation acts.
Modernization of manifest processing requires a new emphasis on collaborative management between the regulated community and federal and state government agencies.  The introduction of an e-Manifest system establishes an integrated solution for hazardous waste transportation that addresses both the needs of current and future users of the system, other government agencies and first responders.  
Hazardous waste generators, hazardous waste transporters, owners or operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs), and any other party that is required to use a manifest must comply with Federal and State requirements to track the shipment, transportation, and receipt of RCRA hazardous waste and state-regulated wastes that are shipped from the site of generation to an off-site facility for treatment, storage or disposal.  When completed, EPA?s e-manifest system will, like the paper manifest, contain information on the type and quantity of the waste being transported, the routing of the waste shipment, any instructions for handling the waste, and signature lines for all parties involved in the transportation process. Each party handling the waste signs the manifest, ensuring a documented chain of custody in the transportation and waste delivery and receipt processes.  Once the waste reaches its destination, the receiving facility will submit  an electronically signed electronic manifest to the system, and the system will distribute a signed copy of the e-manifest to the generator, confirming that the waste has been received by the designated facility. 
III. EPA Requirements for e-Manifest system support
In order to develop, operate, support and potentially migrate the e-Manifest system, EPA will require the following support:
Development of the e-Manifest system: EPA is looking for innovative ideas on the development of the e-Manifest system.  EPA is interested in finding a commercially available/commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) manifesting product that can be used or modified to meet EPA?s needs under e-Manifest.  If a suitable product is unavailable, EPA would be interested in innovative recommendations for development solutions for the e-Manifest system.  EPA is particularly interested in development solutions that do not require the development of a custom coded system with the associated costs for development and maintenance.  EPA also seeks a system architecture that will allow data exchange and service integration with existing EPA systems and services, as well as other third party data systems and services.  The Functional Requirements for e-Manifest are provided below and should be used to understand the requirements for the e-Manifest system.  An important component of e-Manifest will b e the mobile element of the system.  This would allow the electronic manifest to accompany the hazardous waste as it is transported by truck to its destination.
Hosting, Operation and Maintenance of e-Manifest: EPA is looking for solutions for the hosting of e-Manifest.  EPA is interested in an innovative cloud hosting solution that will enable e-Manifest to react to the increase or decrease in usage over time, making available the appropriate resources as required.  EPA will also require updates to the e-Manifest system to meet new user requirements or additional requirements based on future legislation or rulemaking by the Agency affecting e-Manifest.
User Help Support:  EPA is interested in innovative solutions to providing help to the users of e-Manifest, many of which will be truck drivers on the road using new technology and unable to visit a local help desk or having a technician visit.  Methods of allowing users to provide support to each other, the use of social networks for e-Manifest users, and other methods of providing help in a secure, trusted environment are of interest.  EPA also seeks cost effective solutions to the traditional help desk support.  It is important to remember that should problems arise they must be fixed quickly.  Unsolvable problems may require the use of a paper manifest with consequent higher costs on industry when used.
Data Analytics:  Users from EPA, individual states and industry will need to generate reports from the e-Manifest system.  The reporting system must not take processing power from the transactional e-Manifest system in a way that reduces response times.  
e-Manifest Functional Requirements The functional requirements for the e-Manifest system necessary to meet EPA, state and industry needs are available on the e-Manifest requirements meetings website located at http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/transportation/manifest/e-man-meetings.htm.  Please consult the requirements from the most recent stakeholder requirements discussion.  The requirements are provided at the two links below and include an Adobe PDF file grouped by functional area and a `TO-BE? process flow diagram for e-Manifest.  The definitions of the functional areas are also below.  
Requirements slide deck: http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/transportation/manifest/pdf/emanfst_reqrmnts_slids_webnr2.pdf
e-Manifest TO-BE diagram:  http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/transportation/manifest/pdf/emanfst_to_be_diagrm_041113.pdf
Functional areas:
1.  User administration ? requirements for setting up new users, managing users, deleting users, etc.  
2.  Miscellaneous - requirements that do not map to a functional area.
3.  Electronic Manifest Creation ? Covers the process for the initial manifest creation until the generator signs the manifest, including required data elements and user templates. From there, requirements fall into the workflow functional area.  Considers interface requirements, offline and online mode requirements as well as CROMERR/e-sig requirements for generators.  
4.  Electronic Manifest Workflow ? Includes requirements for `chain-of-custody? workflow for generators, transporters and TSDFs, as well as, data validation as the manifest is completed.  Also considers offline and online mode requirements, and CROMERR/e-sig requirements.  
5.  Data QA ? this functional area includes, but is not limited to, data quality assurance between handlers (e.g. discrepancy reporting) as well as QA between states and TSDFs.  
6.  Manifest Format and Communications Standards ? requirements for what standard formats or communications (encoding protocols, etc) are necessary to support electronic manifest creation or data access and QA.  May just be a sub functional area for variety of other categories.
7.  Data access and reporting ? once manifest data is approved or ?final? in the system, what the system will need to do to provide access to the data and provide reports out to various users
8.  Paper manifest processing ? requirements for what the system must do to process paper manifests, which may include document management considerations.  
Other Functional Areas for Consideration:
User fee e-Payment and e-Collection ? data, processes or other areas needed to facilitate user payments and fee collection (this area may not be heavily defined as user fees will be a new rule next year)
System Security
Scalability ? the e-manifest system must be scalable. As the adoption of the system by users increases from the initial launch, more resources will be needed to maintain the system 
IV. Funding Challenge:
EPA expects that it will have limited appropriated funding to support this initiative throughout the system?s development and beyond as well.  However, EPA has developed four options that may address the issue of limited appropriated funding to award and maintain any resultant E-Manifest system.  . 
EPA is interested in industry comments on whether industry would accept any of the contract financing options identified below for any resultant E-Manifest contract.  Additionally, EPA is interested in any alternative solutions to the funding challenge from industry.  The Agency believes fees collected from the regulated community will be available through Congressional appropriations to ultimately defray the contractor?s costs for system development, maintenance and system upgrade costs.  However, the collection of fees and their appropriation is not expected until fiscal year 2015-2016.  EPA would like input regarding the financing options discussed and any proposed by industry in response to this RFI.
EPA?s four funding options are as follows:
Option #1 - Multiyear Performance-Based Payment Contract
EPA could use two existing contracting options in tandem ? Multiyear Contracting and Performance-Based Payments 
Multiyear Contracting (FAR Subpart 17.1)
Under the multiyear contract authority available to the EPA, the Agency would only be required, at the beginning of each contract year, to incrementally fund those costs necessary to cover the current contract year.  
Performance-Based Payments (FAR Subpart 32.10)
With performance-based payments, the Agency would pay the contractor based on performance only if, and when, the contractor successfully satisfies the contract?s specified milestones or standards.  Some of these performance milestones could be set in the later years of the E-manifest contract thereby delaying the outlay of appropriated funds.  The contract must be a fixed-priced type, meaning that the contractor must agree to be bound by a fixed amount of compensation, regardless of the contractor?s actual costs of performing the contract.  
Option #2 ? Cost-Sharing Contract
A cost-sharing contract, under FAR 16.303, is a cost-reimbursement type contract, usually used for Research & Development procurements, where the contractor receives no profit and is reimbursed for only an agreed-upon portion of its allowable costs in expectation of ?substantial compensating benefits.?  ?Substantial compensating benefits? has been interpreted to mean a reasonable expectation of potential commercial application.
Option #3 ? Multi-year Cost-Sharing Contract
This option takes the Cost-Sharing Contract from Option #2 and adds the multi-year contracting element from Option #1.  However, this option cannot include the Performance-Based Payment element of Option #1.  Performance-Based Payments require a fixed-price contract, while a Cost-Sharing Contract must be a cost-reimbursement type contract.
Option #4 ? Cooperative Research & Development Agreement (CRADA)
The Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA) authorizes federal agencies to enter into CRADAs with outside parties (?cooperators? include industry, academia, other government agencies) for ?specified research and development efforts which are consistent with the mission of the laboratory.?  15 U.S.C. ? 3510a(d)(1).  Under a CRADA, cooperators can contribute funds, expertise, personnel, and intellectual property toward effort; federal agencies can make the same types of contributions but cannot contribute funds.  15 U.S.C. ? 3510a(b)(3).
In this option, an IT firm cooperator could join forces with EPA to develop the E-manifest system.  The two parties would combine expertise, and possibly equipment, contractor services and intellectual property, to produce an e-manifest system, and the cooperator could license the building blocks of the joint development (e.g. source code for E-Manifest) for later, commercial application.

<DESC>This is a Project Labor Agreement survey only. This is not a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. There will not be a solicitation, specifications, or drawings available at this time. <br>  <br> The Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the titled project above. <br>  <br> Project Description: Construction of a 279,574 square-foot (SF), multi-story replacement medical research laboratory. This facility includes wet labs, field labs, vivarium under Good Laboratory practices (GLP), warehouse, lab offices, ancillary spaces, logistics, and building support spaces. Supporting facilities include utilities, storm drainage, access roads, parking, and site improvements. This project is required to provide a modern, consolidated laboratory building to support increased demands for Public Health Command (PHC) Lab services, which include worldwide surveillance and diagnostic analysis of vector-borne and communicable diseases. Laboratory services will also support toxicological and occupational health evaluations of new materials used in military systems. <br>  <br> This project will be design/bid/build, using NAICS Code: 236220 - Construction of Buildings, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The magnitude of construction for this project is between $100,000,000.00 and $250,000,000.00. Prime Contractors must self-perform 20% of the work. The estimated period of performance is 730 calendar days.  <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement as described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, and Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLAs per FAR 22.503 (c) are: <br>  <br> a) Does the project require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades? <br>  <br> b) Is there is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited? <br>  <br> c) Will completion of the project require an extended period of time? <br>  <br> d) Have project labor agreements been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project? <br>  <br> e) Will a project labor agreement promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs? <br>  <br> f) Are there any other factors that the Corps should consider? <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> 1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation. <br>  <br> 2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br>  <br> 3. Are you aware of any past or current labor strikes or disputes that would directly impact the consideration of a PLA on the referenced project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br>  <br> 4. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br>  <br> 5. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br>  <br> 6. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br>  <br> 7. Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA for the referenced project. <br>  <br> 8. Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA for the referenced project. <br>  <br> 9. Are there any other the factors the Corps should consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the subject project solicitation and any resultant contract? <br>  <br> The construction community is invited to answer and comment on the use of a PLA for the above titled project. <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to James Mazurick via e-mail at James.A.Mazurick@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 p.m. (EST) on 4 June 2013. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, VA 22134 intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, contract to Kett US, PMB 504, 17853 Santiago Blvd. Ste. 107, Villa Park, CA 92861 (Cage Code: 39AL9) on a sole source basis in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This intent is subject to final approval in accordance with FAR 6.304. The anticipated award date is 31 May 2013 with a delivery of NLT 6 June 2013.
<p>The proposed contract action is to procure two (2) KJT130 Portable Textile Moisture Measurement Devices. The Marine Corps is conducting a tropical uniform study in a jungle environment and desires a capability to accurately measure moisture content of prototype textile uniforms while being worn by Marines during patrolling operations. Portable Textile Moisture Measurement Devices are needed that are accurate across the complete range of moisture content, portable, operable in relatively humid conditions (60% and above), and stores/downloads digital data for further analysis. The textiles that will be measured will consist of various nylon, cotton, Nomex, spandex, and polyester material and the meter must work on all of these textiles.

By submission of its offer, the offeror agrees to all solicitation requirements. This includes the terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and funds in the solicitation and all attachments. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined non-responsive and thereby excluded from any further consideration. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. PRICE PROPOSAL<br />(1) The offeror must submit an overall firm-fixed price, exclusive of annual Service Contract Act Wage Determination increases. Offerors will be evaluated on their entire contract price inclusive of options as indicated in paragraph (2) of this provision.<br />(2) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>B. TECHNICAL</p>
<p>Offerors must submit with their proposal their technical approach for meeting the requirements of the Performance of Work Statement (PWS). This should entail the offerors expected manning levels, labor categories, qualifications (certified maintenance and service technicians, official certification and training, and demonstrated competence in servicing remotely controlled hydraulic and electric road barrier stations), and management approach to meeting the requirements of the PWS. The technical portion will be graded on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information to ensure a proper technical evaluation.</p>
<p>Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revisions. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<p>(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1) Offeror's compliance with all required information in the solicitation: Is the offeror responsive by providing all required information, if not then the offeror may be considered non-responsive and no further evaluation will be accomplished.</p>
<p>2) Lowest Price, technically acceptable.</p>
<p>3) The government will not have discussions, but may ask contractors for clarifications.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) See Addendum 52.212-2</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(a) Contract line item(s) 0001 through 0006 (and all subsequent CLINS) are incrementally funded. For these item(s), the sum of $ of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) For items(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).</p>
<p>(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT".</p>
<p>(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "disputes."</p>
<p>(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "DEFAULT." The provisions of this clause are limited to work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract if fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT."</p>
<p>(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.</p>
<p>(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<p>On execution of contract $--</p>
<p>(month) (day), (year) $----</p>
<p>(month) (day), (year) $----</p>

The following addenda have been attached to this provision:  NONE  <br>  <br> The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this acquisition.  The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:    <br>  <br> The government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose conforming offer will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: Technical Approach and Capability, Past Performance, and Price.  <br>     <br> Technical Approach and Capability and Past Performance are of equal importance and when combined are significantly more important than price.  The government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price and to award without discussions. <br>  <br> A proposal is considered acceptable for evaluation if it addresses all the essential requirements of the request for proposal (RFP), shows the offeror understands all essential requirements of the RFP, and has demonstrated a full capability to perform the prospective requirements, offers a feasible technical approach, and the proposal is complete to the extent that an award could be made on its present terms. <br>  <br> A proposal will be considered unacceptable for award if it contains deficiencies (or a combination of significant weaknesses which equate to one or more deficiencies) which preclude evaluation of the proposal, which are not correctable, or the corrective action would require essentially rewriting the proposal or require the submission of an approach which would be new or almost entirely different from that previously proposed. <br>  <br> Offerors shall submit a written technical proposal not to exceed (NTE) seventy-five (75) pages addressing the following factors which will be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> 1.1 Initial Capability  <br> The proposed initial configuration will be reviewed for capability to achieve the stated mission beyond the specified requirements of the facility.  Features and attributes of the proposed design that contribute to a better research and development facility for military vehicles will be considered for best value.  Innovative and advanced approaches to motors/gearboxes achieving high speeds at reduced size and weight are preferred. <br>  <br>  1.2 Flexibility and Future Growth <br> The ability of the proposed design to accommodate future mission growth will be considered in determination of best value to the Government.  Modularity, expandability, and flexibility of the proposed architecture and hardware will be evaluated to this end. <br>  <br> 1.3 Durability and Lifecycle Costs <br> The offeror's discussion of component durability, maintenance and replacement requirements, operating costs, operational personnel requirements, and other aspects of the system contributing to total lifecycle costs will be considered in the determination of best value.

Submit a list of similar contracts that your firm has performed in the past three years. The Government will contact each offeror's customers to ask whether or not: (1) the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract (specifications); (3) the offeror finished within the contract time; (4) the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (5) proposals should provide evidence of past projects demonstrating adherence to specifications and standards such as those listed below.  Proposals' attention is specifically called to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70 and NFPA 70E, due to the potential electrical hazards associated with equipment provided under this contract; (6) the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: Federal, state, and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.   <br>  <br> 2.3 Price  <br> Price will be evaluated based on the total proposed price.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a training program entitled ASME B31.3 Pipe Process Design.  The objective of the program is to provide learners with instruction that explains how piping systems fail and what the Code requires the designer, manufacturer, fabricator, supplier, erector, examiner, inspector, and owner to do to prevent system failure.  Using hundreds of real-world examples as well as the personal experiences of the instructors, the course demonstrates how the B31.3 Code has been both correctly and incorrectly applied.  Lessons are enhanced by actual in-class problem solving, directly applying the rules and equations of the B31.3 Code for specific design and operating conditions.  Students will learn to identify what issues to take into consideration when designing process piping, explain the pressure design of piping and piping components, analyze piping flexibility and gauge the limitations of piping and piping components, and identify pipe supports leak testing, piping failures and their causes.  This offering shall be held at NASAs Kennedy Space Center beginning July 22, 2013. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the above curriculum from American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2 Park Avenue, New York, New York.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106(b), the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: No other U.S. based vendors were identified that can provide this training. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using the procedures in FAR Part 13.106. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. Central Standard Time on June 4, 2013.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Candice C. Talley at Candice.C.Talley@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK - NAAJL160-13-00207</p>
<p>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR BOULDER LABS, BOULDER, COLORADO</p>
<p><br />I. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary professional practitioners, support personnel, material, and services to perform the following work and are required once a week for approximately 5-6 hours from 9AM to 3PM.

The vendor must be able available for emergency consultation and help outside of these time periods if needed with a 2 hour or sooner response time. The current contractor is the University of Colorado, Psychology Department since 1985.</p>
<p>A. Statement of Work</p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>Within 42 USC Section 4541 (PL 91-616, Dec. 31, 1970) and 21 USC Section 1101 (Public Law 92-255, March 21, 1972) Congress has specifically recognized the need for appropriate prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and services for alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and drug abuse among Federal civilian employees. Under 5 USC Sections 7361 and 7362 agencies are encouraged to extend, to the extent feasible, rehabilitation services and programs to family members who are drug abusers and/or alcoholics. 5 USC Section 7901 further allows that, "The head of each agency of the Government of the United States may establish, within the limits of appropriations available, a health service program to promote and maintain the physical and mental fitness of employees under his jurisdiction." To meet these and other applicable statutory requirements, the Department of Commerce (DOC) through its Office of Human Resources Management, has directed the establishment of employee assistance programs (EAPs) within all of its subordinate agencies.</p>
<p>2. General</p>
<p>The Employee Health Unit located in Boulder Colorado has the responsibility to establish and maintain an employee assistance program for the approximate 1100 employees located in this geographic region.<br /><br />3. Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to acquire the services of a qualified organization/institution and/or qualified professional practitioners, hereinafter referred to as the contractor, to provide 1) clinical counseling and other life management assistance to DOC employees, their immediate family members, and anyone living within an<br />employee's household who has an impact on the employee's well-being; 2) employee outreach and education programs; 3) counseling and training for managers and supervisors; and 4) an annual report which document the extent to which the required services were performed. <br /><br />4. Employee Population and Location</p>
<p>There are approximately 1100 employees located in and around the Boulder area who are eligible for EAP service at the Broadway site. Office space will be provided within the Employee Health Service located at 325 Broadway, Boulder Colorado.</p>
<p><br />5. Responsibilities of Key Agency Personnel</p>
<p>Providing effective EAP services will be dependent on a close working relationship between the contractor and key personnel from participating agencies. These key personnel and their responsibilities are as follows.</p>
<p>EAP Administrator</p>
<p>The EAP Administrator will coordinate the implementation and on-going operation of the overall program, provide liaison between the contractor and the participating agencies, and report on the contractor's performance.</p>
<p><br />PERFORMANCE BASED QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN</p>
<p><br />1. PURPOSE</p>
<p>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards included in this Purchase Order. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.</p>
<p>2. AUTHORITY</p>
<p>Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E - Inspection and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the articles, services, and documentation called for in Purchase Order to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative.</p>
<p>3. Statement of Work</p>
<p>The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the Purchase Order. The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor's performance to assure performance is timely, effective and delivering the results specified in the Purchase Order.</p>
<p>4. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES</p>
<p>The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan:<br />Contracting Officer (CO) - [Reference Section G, Clause G.1 1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (April 2010)], A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the Government.<br />Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - [Reference Section G, Clause G.2 1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR) April 2010)] An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act as his authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. The source and authority for a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COR) is the Contracting Officer. COR limitations are contained in the written letter of designation.</p>
<p>5. RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Government resources shall have responsibilities for the implementation of this QASP as follows:<br />Contracting Officer - The Contracting Officer [as defined in Section G, Clause G.1 1 1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (April 2010)] ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance. COR - The COR [as defined in Section G, Clause G.2 1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR) April 2010)] is responsible for technical administration of the project and assures proper Government surveillance of the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action. While the COR may serve as a direct conduit to provide Government guidance and feedback to the Contractor on technical matters, he or she is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.</p>
<p>6. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p>The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used in the administration of this QASP. In addition to specific instructions that may be mentioned, the appropriate and standardized form that is to be used for documentation of QA surveillance is the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form.<br />100% Inspection - This level of inspection shall be accomplished by monitoring and documentation. <br />Periodic Inspection - Periodic inspections shall be conducted if and when specified in the Purchase Order. <br />Random Monitoring - Random monitoring shall be conducted at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Even though the Government, through its COR, will be monitoring the contractor's performance on a continuing basis, the volume of tasks performed by the contractor makes technical inspections of every task and step impractical. Accordingly, the Government will use a quality-assurance review process to monitor the contractor's performance under this contract. The contractor's performance will be evaluated at the end of the Purchase Order period of performance, contract period or if there is an unsatisfactory report submitted by the COR for any performance problem on the contract. Ratings will be made in two categories.</p>
<p>Satisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate meets the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are minor and offset by outstanding elements of performance within the Standard;</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate fails to meet the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are pervasive;</p>
<p>In general, the work will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the purchase order are satisfied, the extent to which the work performed follows the approach found in the Statement of Work, quality of work, clarity of documentation, timely completion of scheduled tasks, cost control and business relations. At the discretion of the COR or the Contracting Officer or Specialist, other government officials approved by the Contracting Officer or Purchasing Agent may be asked to evaluate a particular deliverable or set of deliverables.</p>
<p><br />7. ANALYSIS OF SURVEILLANCE RESULTS</p>
<p>When appropriate, the CO may investigate an event further to determine if all the facts and circumstances surrounding the event were considered in the COR opinions outlined on the forms. The CO will immediately discuss every element receiving a substandard rating with the Contractor to assure that corrective action is promptly initiated.</p>
<p>At the end of every contract period, the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of his/her surveillance of the Contractor's performance during the previous period. This report will become part of the formal QA documentation. This documentation will be used for the contractor's yearly performance report documenting quality, timeliness of performance, cost control, business relations and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>If the level of performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory, the remedies at 52.246-4(e) will be assessed against the Contractor.</p>
<p><br />Deliverables:</p>
<p>The COR will, in addition to providing documentation to the Contracting Officer, maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions related to the Government's performance of the quality assurance function, including the originals of all Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms. All such records will be retained for the life of this contract. The COR shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the contract.</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B. ORIGIN (FEB 2006) SHIPPING WITH NOLSC INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED UPON AWARD. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1100 Pacific Time on 03 JUN 2013.</p>

(FEB 1995)<br />(a) Definition. "Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.<br />(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time<br />of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy<br />to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for<br />qualification.<br />(Name) _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Randy Ferriss</span>_______<br />(Address) _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">USDA-ARS-NADC, 2300 Dayton Ave., Building 11 Warehouse, Ames, IA 50010</span>__<br />(c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.<br />Offeror's Name _____________________________________<br />Manufacturer's Name______ __________________________<br />Source's Name _____________________________________<br />Item Name ________________________________________<br />Service Identification ________________________________<br />Test Number _______________________________________<br />(to the extent known)<br />(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract,<br />the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary<br />whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.<br />(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p><strong>&bull; Please review all past AFCECBAA-11-001 Complete Questions and Answers (attached) before submitting a question to the Contracting Officer (CO). </strong></p>
<p><br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), Environmental Quality Technical Support Branch (CZTQ) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to more efficient and effective solutions for environmental compliance concerns across the Air Force and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Environmental Compliance and Pollution Prevention Programs. This solicitation is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e., a service). The Environmental Quality Program areas of need for this announcement are:</p>
<p>a. Hazardous Materials: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies or methodologies to remove or treat Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) from Aqueous Fire Fighting Foam (AFFF). The Air Force has excess AFFF stockpiles that contains between 3 to 6% PFOA/PFOS. Proposals need to develop a cost effective mechanism to remove or treat PFOA/PFOS from the AFFF to reduce disposal costs for the Air Force while transitioning to new formations of AFFF that do not contain PFOA or PFOS. Current destruction of AFFF is through incineration which is expensive to the Air Force.</p>
<p>b. Industrial Wastewater Treatment: Proposals should identify new or innovative industrial wastewater treatment technologies for recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewater treatment plants. Example installations are Robbins AFB and Hill AFB.</p>
<p>c. Stormwater Modeling Techniques: Proposals should identify installation-wide watershed modeling approaches that enable base facility engineers to maintain compliance with Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) section 438. Each base has industrial stormwater permit that requires best management practices to eliminate illicit discharges to waters of the United States. Example of best management practices include but not limited to use energy efficient low maintenance technologies to reuse stormwater from roofs, parking lots, runways and other impervious surfaces. Additionally, mission requirements identify and manage the reduction of flooding conditions. Air Force does not want to build retention and detention systems for projects. Priority will be given to proposals that do not use continuous simulation techniques.</p>
<p>Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This requirement is restricted to US - companies, academic institutions, non-profit institutions, and/or government agencies. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate as subcontractors to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Acquisition Overview: The AFCEC BAA is a two-step process that includes two phases of proposal submittals:</p>
<p>Phase I - submit a 2 page online form (white paper/pre-proposal) at <br />http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa</p>
<p>Phase II - if invited, submit a full proposal that details the technology, the demonstration, and validation approach, and the costs for the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Relevant forms, samples and guides are found on FedBizOps and the AFCEC BAA Website. Evaluation criteria for Phase I are included in the proposal instruction document provided in this announcement. The anticipated award of AFCECBAA-13-002 is Fiscal Year 13, 4th Quarter.</p>
<p>How to Apply: All Phase I white papers/pre-proposals must be submitted as an online form and can be accessed through AFCEC's website (http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa). Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 01JUNE 2013. Phase I submittals received after 01 June 2013will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Evaluation/Notification: Phase I white papers/pre-proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the evaluation criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs (as indicated in the Phase I evaluation criteria) are notified electronically via email to submit a proposal to Phase II (request for proposal); those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are sent to key personnel contact information listed in Phase I white paper/pre-proposal along with a Request for Proposal (RFP) Package, Phase II instructions, how and when Phase II proposals are to be submitted to the Air Force. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required.</p>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). ___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.      <br>            <br>      2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.      <br>            <br>      Factor 1 - Technical Capability      <br>      Factor 2 - Past Performance      <br>      Factor 3 - Price      <br>            <br>      3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.        <br>            <br>      4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.      <br>            <br>      5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.      <br>            <br>      (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA      <br>            <br>      1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability      <br>            <br>      The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.      <br>            <br>      Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings      <br>      Rating	           Description      <br>      Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.      <br>      Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.        <br>            <br>      2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance      <br>            <br>      a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.      <br>            <br>      b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include:      <br>            <br>      Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,       <br>      Name of the Point of Contact (POC),       <br>      POC Telephone Number,      <br>      POC Email address,       <br>      Contract Number,       <br>      Period of Performance, and      <br>      Description of goods/services rendered.       <br>            <br>      c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.      <br>            <br>      Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings      <br>      Rating	        Description      <br>      Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown.      <br>      Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort.      <br>            <br>            <br>      3.  Factor 3 - Price      <br>            <br>      Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of:      <br>            <br>      3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;       <br>            <br>      3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg).      <br>            <br>      3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.       <br>            <br>      (end of provision)      <br>            <br>      52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012)      <br>      52.247-29 	F.O.B.

The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.      <br>            <br>      (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.      <br>            <br>      (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed  12  months.      <br>      (End of clause)      <br>            <br>      252.211-7003   ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION (JUN 2011)      <br>      252.232-7006 	Wide Area WorkFlow Payment Instructions 	JUN 2012       <br>            <br>      CONTRACTOR IDENTIFICATION (DEC 2005) (USAMRAA)       <br>            <br>      	When contractor personnel perform the services required in this contract on a Government installation they are required to possess and wear an identification badge that displays his or her name and the name of the Company.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<DESC>1.0 Description
<p>1.1 The Air Force Applications Center (AFTAC) TM Directorate and AFISRA/A7KR are conducting Market Research for non-personal services to provide Atmospheric Gas Analysis services. This sources sought is one element of our Market Research, and it will be used to determine the acquisition approach. It will additionally be used to determine, if needed, the sub-contracting goals. Therefore, if your company has the capabilities to participate as a subcontractor, please let us know.</p>
<p>1.2 This Sources Sought Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB). The Government may use the information obtained from responses to this notice in determining its acquisition approach, but the issuance of this notice does not restrict the Government acquisition approach. The Government contemplates award of a five (5) year contract.</p>
<p>1.3 The capabilities package should describe relevant contract experience offered to Government and commercial customers. Include a reference to the contract number, magnitude, place of performance, and points of contact for each example provided (name of the point of contact, address, e-mail, telephone number, fax number, and the company's web page, if applicable). Submitted information shall be UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>1.4 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380. The small business size standard is $14.0M.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with the processing, separation, and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification. Definition of some terms: sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate selected atmospheric radioactive effluent gasses of interest for analysis.</p>
<p>Gas analysis requires the ability to:</p>
<p>(a) be proficient with various radioactive gas counting techniques <br />(b) determine, prior to separation, the percent of oxygen and nitrogen and the volume (in cubic centimeters) of other selected effluent gases within sample bottles <br />(c) separate selected radioactive effluent gases, as required, from cryogenic air samples<br />(d) radioassay separated samples <br />(e) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required. Requests for these analyses may occur with little notice and may require 8-hour to 24-hour analysis capability. <br />f) In the event the Government elects to procure atmospheric gas analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will be performed), prior to performance start <br />(g) Offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique analysis equipment essential to the mission will be provided, with ownership retained by the Government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for gas analysis services shall not be used for activities other than Government work without the expressed written permission of the Government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work<br />(h) Prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET level.</p>
<p>2.1 Estimated Period of Performance: 1 Oct 2014 - 30 Sep 2019</p>
<p>2.3 Security Requirements: Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 2 to change Small Business Set Aside Designation</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Plant Protection and Quarantine Protection Facility in Edinburg, TX is in need of a Multi year contract, for Purple color Prism traps with Stickem. The requested supplies are needed to equip program personnel to detect and monitor EAB pest infestations. The lure-baited traps are a primary detection tool used to delimit, and survey the extent of the pest infestation. Without these lure dispensers and traps defining the infestation might not be possible. The ultimate cost to the States which become infested could lose billions of dollars in forest products, and quarantines imposed by state and federal agencies may have dire consequences for plant and wood products industries. Severe damage would also occur within the tourist industry. <br />The following vendors &lsquo; products have been evaluated and tested through previous trial agreements and have already met our color saturation requirements. In accordance with FAR 52.209-4 (i)The Government may waive the requirement for first article approval test where supplies identical or similar to those called for in the schedule have been previously furnished by the Offeror/Contractor and have been accepted by the Government. The Offeror/Contractor may request a waiver.</p>

<p>LAIRD PLASTICS <br />DUNS: 043288711 CAGE Code: 6GZT4 <br />BRISTOL, PA</p>
<p><br />This is a 100% Small business Set -Aside. The associated NAICS code for this effort is - 325320 (Pesticide and other agricultural chemical manufacturing). The small business size standard is 1000 Employees. <br />This decision is based on the Statement Of Work requirement for the application of Tanglefoot pesticide adhesive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This requirement will be awarded as a commercial supply, firm-fixed-price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract, FOB destination.</p>
<p>Interested sources are encouraged to add your contact information to the interested vendors list for this announcement or send a direct email to Contract Specialist Carol Dingess before closing date of this announcement. Telephonic inquiries will not be honored. Please email or fax all questions regarding subject item(s) prior to presolicitation closing date to: Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov fax # 612-336-5000.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING AMENDED TO REVISE THE LAST PARAGRAPH, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND THE CLOSING DATE OF THE SOLICITATION.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION</span></strong>:
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement</strong>:</p>
<p>1. HiSeq 2500, Catalog Number: SY-401-2501, Quantity: One (1). <br />2. Shipping and Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for NISC services. NISC currently has three (3) MiSeq Systems, three (3) Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx, and three (3) HiSeq 2000 Systems which are proven platforms for genetic analysis and functional genomics. This instrument's parallel sequencing technology leverages clonal cluster formation and proprietary reversible terminator chemistry to give it the speed and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing to generate billions of bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run. The HiSeq 2500 is compatible with the existing MiSeq, Cbot Cluster, Genome Analyzer IIx and the HiSeq 2000 that are currently being used in the Sequencing Center. Maintaining compatibility is a must and essential.</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 System provides ultra-high output and speed. In a single run one is able to sequence more than 5 human genomes at ~30x coverage. The HiSeq 2500 system is able to process a diverse set of samples within one flow cell, and with the highest data quality currently available. Another key factor in this selection is that this instrument is able to run in an alternate rapid mode which would allow the researchers to decrease turnaround time by many weeks. This is a critical consideration for projects impacting patient diagnosis. The HiSeq 2500 can be switched between a high throughput mode and rapid turnaround run mode. In high throughput run mode, similar to the HiSeq 2000, the HiSeq 2500 enables sequencing of a large number of genomes, exomes, or transcriptomes in a single run, allowing large studies to be completed with the fewest number of runs. In rapid run mode, the HiSeq 2500 is capable of sequencing a 30x genome in a day or completing fast multiplexed applications such as exome resequencing or RNA-Seq. The rapid run time includes automated, on-instrument cluster generation, and paired-end sequencing, with no user intervention needed throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 also allows researchers to process samples by a single method that is compatible with HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 2500. This simplifies the NISC lab processes, minimizing labor and equipment costs, and gives researchers the flexibility to route samples to either machine type depending on the needs of the project and machine availability. The high speed of the HiSeq 2500, means that reagents sit out for a shorter period of time and decay to a lesser degree during the run. The result is longer, more accurate reads (300 vs 200 bases). This allows NISC to expand the sequencing applications supported on this platform, as some supplications require longer reads.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span></strong>:<br />Delivery of HiSeq 2500 will be delivered within 6-weeks of receiving the approved contract award.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br /></span></strong><br />The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium. <br />While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. When an investigator wishes to study only selected genes or genomic regions it is more cost-effective and efficient to perform targeted sequencing. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong></span>:<br /><br />&bull; Must be able to run the same chemistry as HiSeq 2000, MiSeq, and Genome Analyzer IIx Systems.<br />&bull; Run time for 200 base run must be under 30 hours.<br />&bull; Data should be able to be processed through NISC's data analysis software.<br />&bull; Preparation time for samples to load on the sequencer should take about a day.<br />&bull; Read length at least 150 bp.<br />&bull; Produce paired-end reads of 60 million per run.<br />&bull; Reagents are in convenient volumes and are ready-to-load.<br />&bull; Oil is not required for the optics.<br />&bull; Straightforward protocols that require no beads or emulsions.<br />&bull; System should be able to perform amplification, sequencing and data analysis in one unit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Responsibilities</span></strong>:<br />Not applicable</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</span></strong>:<br />Not Applicable</p>

<DESC>This purpose of this announcement is to release a pre-solicitation notice in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 5.204. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to conduct a full and open competition and release solicitation N00024-13-R-4304 for the accomplishment of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) Class Planning Yard services in the first quarter of calendar year 2013.  The LCS Planning Yard services include but are not limited to the following types of Class Support: Fleet Modernization Program planning; ship change planning, development and installation; Operating Cycle Integration Program Management; work integration package engineering; Ship Configuration Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) support and Configuration Data Management (CDM); research engineering and modeling; Provisioned Items Order and other Integrated Planning Yard (IPY) Material Support; technical documentation maintenance and updates, including Engineering Operational Sequencing System and !
Combat System Operational Sequencing System (EOSS and CSOSS); NSEDR system input and data management; interface and coordination with Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs); managing related class Ship Selected Record Document (SSRD) and Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) engineering standardization efforts; and Preventative and Planned Maintenance System (PMS) item development and scheduling.
Unique to this Planning Yard is the requirement for the Contractor to manage the scheduling of all planned, continuous, and emergent maintenance, and associated availabilities (for example, CMAVs, PMAVs, and WOOs). This responsibility includes the requirement to integrate work completion by multiple, likely simultaneous, private and public organizations.  Contract award is projected to be made in the first quarter of calendar year January 2014 and continue for a period of performance of five years: one year plus four one-year options.
 
No telephone or email inquiries will be accepted regarding this notice and attachment, and requests for solicitation packages will not be granted, as a solicitation has not been prepared at this time.
 
Future information, if any, will be posted at the websites for FBO (https://www.fbo.gov/) and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/), the same sites where this announcement is posted.

<DESC>This is a Project Labor Agreement survey only. This is not a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. There will not be a solicitation, specifications, or drawings available at this time. <br /><br />The Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the titled project above. <br /><br />Project Description: Construction of a 279,574 square-foot (SF), multi-story replacement medical research laboratory. This facility includes wet labs, field labs, vivarium under Good Laboratory practices (GLP), warehouse, lab offices, ancillary spaces, logistics, and building support spaces. Supporting facilities include utilities, storm drainage, access roads, parking, and site improvements. This project is required to provide a modern, consolidated laboratory building to support increased demands for Public Health Command (PHC) Lab services, which include worldwide surveillance and diagnostic analysis of vector-borne and communicable diseases. Laboratory services will also support toxicological and occupational health evaluations of new materials used in military systems. <br /><br />This project will be design/bid/build, using NAICS Code: 236220 - Construction of Buildings, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The magnitude of construction for this project is between $100,000,000.00 and $250,000,000.00. Prime Contractors must self-perform 20% of the work. The estimated period of performance is 730 calendar days. <br /><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement as described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, and Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br /><br />Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLAs per FAR 22.503 (c) are: <br /><br />a) Does the project require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades? <br /><br />b) Is there is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited? <br /><br />c) Will completion of the project require an extended period of time? <br /><br />d) Have project labor agreements been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project? <br /><br />e) Will a project labor agreement promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs? <br /><br />f) Are there any other factors that the Corps should consider? <br /><br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br /><br />1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation. <br /><br />2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br /><br />3. Are you aware of any past or current labor strikes or disputes that would directly impact the consideration of a PLA on the referenced project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br /><br />4. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. <br /><br />5. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br /><br />6. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br /><br />7. Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA for the referenced project. <br /><br />8. Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA for the referenced project. <br /><br />9. Are there any other the factors the Corps should consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the subject project solicitation and any resultant contract? <br /><br />The construction community is invited to answer and comment on the use of a PLA for the above titled project. <br /><br />Responses shall be submitted via email to James Mazurick via e-mail at James.A.Mazurick@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 p.m. (EST) on 4 June 2013. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA SAO East - 240E - Contracting Office intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA SAO East - 240E - Contracting Office is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION PRIORITY 03 <br>  <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Spinal Fusion Implants for a non-routine surgery. <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services: This requirement is required to a patient diagnosed with Lumbar Stenosis. Surgery to be performed will be an L4-5 and L5-S1 decompression and a Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) at San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), Ft Sam Houston, TX. <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: <br> - Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting competition for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. (e.g. urgency). <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a) (2), Exceptions, the unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c) (1), Soliciting competition, price and availability will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5. Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is a true, urgent request that has been verified by MAJ Vilma Rojas and Emerita Torres on 17 May 2013. The Spinal Fusion Implants must be received for a non-routine surgery scheduled on 20 May 2013. If the physician does not have these implants during surgery, it could be detrimental to the patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission. <br>  <br> 6. Contracting Officer Certification: I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> //ORIGINAL SIGNED 05/17/2013// <br> Name: Melissa Oliva <br> Title: Contracting Officer
