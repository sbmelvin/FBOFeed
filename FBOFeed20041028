<CONTACT>Sue Fraser Purchasing Agent 2083785103     sfraser@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ed Kemp, 5024 Painted Hill's, Ephrata, Washington. The proposed action is for consultation services from Mr. Kemp to assist the Bureau of Reclamation in the preparation of legal materials for defense of litigation brought against the United States by the Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District (GCBSID). Reclamation's needs are as follows: 1.) Assist the Department of Interior Solicitor's Office in Boise and the Department of Justice in the preparation of legal materials for defense of litigation brought against the United States by the Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District (GCBSID).  This effort is time sensitive and needs to be filled immediately by someone who already has extensive knowledge of Project History, specific background information on the formation of the Quincy Groundwater Subarea (QGWSA), and the legislative history and legal challenges which have occurred in the past 40 plus years. 2.) Research project files and archives for old documents pertaining to the formation and administration of the QGWSA dating back approximately 40 years.  Contractor must be intimately acquainted with the specific working and legal files pertaining to the QGWSA and be able to remember the sequence of events and what documents were created which may apply to the current litigation. Contractor must be able to identify locations of such files and recognize pertinent information. 3.) Provide insight into interrelation between Reclamation laws and State laws pertaining to the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of the QGWSA.  Contractor must be knowledgeable in the authorizations granted to the Columbia Basin Project and their correlation with Washington State Law regarding the QGWSA. 4.) Conduct reviews of prior legislative actions and litigation regarding the QGWSA. 5.) Participate in meetings and information sessions as a subject matter expert. 6.) Gather and assemble data and prepare materials for Reclamation and/or the Solicitor's Office for admission in court. The proposed contractor's unique qualifications are as follows: Mr. Kemp is uniquely qualified to perform the services because of his in-depth and current working knowledge of the Columbia Basin Project and particularly the Quincy Groundwater Subarea.  Mr. Kemp has worked directly with the program since its inception and has the critical and specific knowledge of the QGWSA unavailable anywhere else.  Mr. Kemp has over 30 years of experience working with Reclamation and States laws pertaining to groundwater issues and specifically the QGWSA.  He has worked with the Solicitor and Justice Department in several prior lawsuits and knows how to find and identify documents critical to the case.  He has extensive in- depth knowledge of Reclamation and Washington State laws, water rights, legislative and Project specific history which he gained while working as a Reclamation employee involved in such issues for over 30 years.  The immediate objective is to do research and prepare documentation for litigation as expeditiously as possible.  Mr. Kemp's knowledge of Reclamation and Washington State law; his wealth of knowledge of the Columbia Basin Project, the Quincy Groundwater Subarea, the Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District, and the issues of the current litigation; his reputation as an authority on groundwater issues and history; and his ability to define the history of the QGWSA will require minimal start-up time and assist with timely and successful defense of United States' interests in the case at hand.

<DESC>Supply and Investment Analysis of Mobile Alternating Current Power System (MACS) GovWorks is issuing a Request for Quote on behalf of the U.S. Army - Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), who has a requirement for the design and construction of a Mobil Alternating Current System (MACS).  This RFQ is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items).  MACS have been demonstrated by the Army since 1999 at various installations and geographical areas.  The purpose has been to supply electrical power to remote areas of installations where electricity from the local power grid is either not available or not economical.  The objectives of this demonstration program are to:  (a) provide a platform for demonstrating, promoting and understanding the renewable energy technologies as applied to remote energy missions for Army installations applications, (b) demonstrate renewable energy hybrid electric alternatives to fossil fuel generators, and (c) reduce logistical requirement for fossil fuel and maintenance of generators.  The technologies used for this demonstration will be solar, wind and hydrogen.  Of these three, hydrogen energy is the focus of this application.  Hydrogen energy in this case will be a three part system, using energy from (1) solar/wind to (2) electrolyze water and then to use the (3) hydrogen from this process to be used as fuel in a hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) or fuel cell.  Using hydrogen as a fuel will lessen dependency on fossil fuels and will reduce pollution emissions.  The MACS must not exceed 3,000 pounds and must fit inside an M105, 1.5T (payload) trailer which is required for mobility purposes and will be provided by the Army.  Energy production requirements must meet or exceed:  (1) 6 kilowatts of photovoltaic (PV) array(s) (to minimize volumetric and weight considerations, thin film PV is desired having high energy density characteristics (e.g. watts / kilogram)),  (2) 1 kilowatts of wind turbine, (3) 5kW electrolysis converter, (4) 5 kilowatt hydrogen ICE (or fuel cell), and (5) 10 kilowatt power inverter.   The delivery date for all components will be on or before 11 March 2005.  FOB shall be DESTINATION, United States Military Academy (USMA), West Point, New York.  This requirement is being procured using full & open competition.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 335911.  This will constitute the only posting to FedBizOpps.  The competitive Request for Quote (RFQ), specifications, RFQ amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp under RFQ number 40727.  The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about November 4, 2004, and will be available via the Internet at the above web site until 30 November 2004.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Alan.Rumney@mms.gov.  Ensure the RFQ number and project title is referenced on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253©(1) of the United States Code and FAR 
6.302-1(a)(2) , with Hallcrest Systems, Inc. DHS has the need for immediate and accurate information and evaluation of the requirements for, current status of, institutional roadblocks to, and technology strategy and technology roadmap for a system for doing comprehensive background checks for applicants to sensitive positions in industries considered to be significant to homeland security, especially in the area of critical infrastructure protection.  It is believed that enhanced background-checking standards and technology can help mitigate threats by insiders—employees, contractors, suppliers, etc.—and thereby upgrade the overall security of the critical infrastructure and other significant business enterprises.   Hallcrest will perform and document the following work/services I. Literature Search and Review II. Structured Interviews with Industry Representatives and Other Experts III. Surveys and Focus Groups.  Hallcrest Systems, Inc. is unique in having a twenty-nine year history of providing security and human resource research and consulting services to law enforcement, other government organizations and private sector clients. Hallcrest is widely regarded as the nation’s preeminent firm in the area of private security research and consulting. For more than two decades, Hallcrest has specialized in studying all sectors of the U.S. security industry and its relationships with public law enforcement. Without the services of Hallcrest Systems, Inc., the time and effort to assemble an equivalent body of expertise and respond to the science and technology needs of the Department of Homeland Security would be severely hampered. In addition Hallcrest Systems, Inc. is already under contract to DHS to produce a study on comprehensive background checks for private security guards. The considerable amount of time and effort required for another company to obtain the same level of knowledge, expertise, contacts within the security field and methods for assessing the present state of background checking would significantly retard the completion of this high priority effort. The period of performance shall be nine (9) months from the date of award.  The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation package will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Massachusetts Institutes of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL).  MIT/LL is a non-profit organization which operates as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).   In accordance with FAR, Section 35.107 this proposed effort cannot be performed by in-house or contractor resources.  MIT/LL has had work ongoing on automatic speaker recognition research for the U.S. Secret Service for a number of years, and has been nationally recognized for that work.  The team at MIT/LL consistently places first in the yearly NIST- sponsored speaker recognition evaluations.  Lincoln advanced the research in higher-level features in speech and voice during a workshop led by Lincoln at Johns Hopkins University in the summer of 2002.  The impact of this workshop was evident in the 2003 NIST speaker recognition workshops as participants followed MIT’s lead and brought higher-level features into their systems.  These higher-level features have already improved error rates of automatic systems. 
As a recognized expert in this area, MIT/LL brings a range of research capabilities and awareness of operational systems and concepts which cannot be duplicated without significant delay and additional cost to this effort. 
The Verbal Identification Program will develop methods to improve speaker recognition for forensic application domains, including harnessing the higher-level features in human speech that discriminate among speakers; and incorporate these methods and analyses into modules to be used in a user interface for expert-driven examinations.  It supports the HSARPA Program by developing the appropriate tools and technology to assist in the identification of foreign terrorists via speech and voice.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  The period of performance shall be 24 months from the date of award.  The government anticipates a firm fixed-fee contract.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation package will issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>THIS REQUIREMENT IS A 100% TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code identified for this requirement is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is soliciting proposals from small business concerns to provide resources to support for multiple and simultaneously-running multi-site clinical trials conducted under the National Institute on Drug Abuse Center for the Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The development of the CCTN was based, in part, upon a recommendation from the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse and conclusions of the Physicians Leadership on National Drug Policy.  The Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Sciences report "Bridging the Gap Between Practice and Research:  Forging Partnerships with Community-Based Drug and Alcohol Treatment" also recommended a national network for drug abuse treatment trials.  Following the first NIDA CTN solicitation in 1999, six CTN awards were made to awardees in California, Connecticut, New York, Oregon, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. After a solicitation in 2000, awards were subsequently made to five additional sites in Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and South Carolina.  In 2001 three additional sites were awarded in New York (Long Island), North Carolina and Washington. In 2002 there were three additional sites added in California, Massachusetts, and New Mexico.  These sites represent a variety of treatment traditions that include pharmacological as well as behavioral and other psychosocial interventions.  Furthermore, NIDA ensured a wide variety of patient populations in the selection of CTN recipients. Women, minority groups, and adolescents are well represented.  A new RFA DA-05-001 was released July 7, 2004, to fund eleven new and/or competing applications to replace the first eleven Nodes that are expiring in August 2005.  The location of the Nodes and their Community Treatment Providers may change depending on the awards given out for this RFA. 

The purpose of this contract is to provide a wide range of clinical trial administrative support and related services for multi-site clinical trials conducted within the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN).  No actual clinical trials will be carried out under this contract.  Activities under this contract will support the trials carried out under cooperative agreements (U-10) with Regional Research and Training Centers (RRTC) located across the nation.  The work required under this contract includes:

1)	Providing support for regulatory functions and requirements; 
2)	Reviewing and monitoring protocol implementation; 
3)	Providing training to research staff; 
4)	Providing pharmaceutical services and clinical support;
5)	Providing drug testing and analytical laboratory services;
6)	Providing support for protocol development in the areas related to the tasks specified in the Statement of Work; 
7)	Participating in relevant committee and subcommittee meetings and conference calls; and, 
8)	Providing other expert consultation and support services as needed.  

This will be a three-year contract with options to extend for two additional years plus options to cover an increase in the number of RRTCs in the network. RFP No. NO1DA-5-2208 will be available electronically on or about November 12, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIDA website at the following address: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html). Please note that the RFP for this acquisition will be streamlined to include only the Work Statement, Deliverables, Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements, Mandatory Qualifications, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and other necessary Proposal Preparation Instructions.  However, all information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the streamlined electronic RFP package.  Response to the RFP is due on or about January 11, 2005.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sunset Laboratory Inc. for  a commercially available "off-the-shelf"Semi-Continuous Organic / Elemental Field Carbon Aerosol Analyzer to quantify emissions of black (elemental) carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) from natural OC oxidation of gas-phase compounds, biomass burning and other combustion sources under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. This requirement for the ORD / APPCD will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This acquisition is for one (1)  Semi-Continuous Organic / Elemental Field Carbon Aerosol Analyzer that meets the following minimum specifications: (1) Field Deployable Unit; (2) Accuracy < 5% bias at 100 ug m?3 carbon concentration; (3) Response Time less than 30 minutes; (4) Quartz Filter Sampling Medium; (5) Span 1 - 50,000 ug  m?3 for 30 minute sample; (6) Power Consumption < 15 amp draw, 120 VAC; (7) Thermal / Optical Transmission; (8) Conforms to NIOSH Method 5040 specifications; (9) Standard Warranty; (10) Operating Manual; (11) UL Certified or Equivalent; (12) The analyzer shall include: One (1) 2.5 um,  8.2  lpm  cyclone, One (1) Sampling Pump, Two (2) Spare Heating Coils, One (1) Spare Quartz Main Oven, One (1) Parallel Plate Denuder.  The U.S. EPA believes that Sunset Laboratory Inc. is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because market research indicates it is the only field instrument available  that conforms to NIOSH Method 5040 specifications.  Utilizing the Sunset Laboratory Inc. instrument will ensure reliability for quantifying organic carbon since different organic compounds have drastically different absorption spectra and other instruments use strictly optical techniques that have  proven unreliable.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required instrument may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of  this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive  procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This procurement is being processed utilizing NAICS Code 334513 with a size standard of 500  employees.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2109 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not  be honored.  See numbered note 26.

A wafer may contain 50-200 chips each of which may contain 100-20,000 individual devices.  The resolution of the chip imaging is less than one micrometer.  Because this Wafer Stepper is central to every other step that is done to produce these chips, it is imperative that it be in good working condition at all times.  The maintenance/repair service is to include the cost of all instrumentation, tools, tool kits, labor, parts and transportation (both persons and things) necessary to maintain this equipment at warranty standards.  All maintenance and repairs shall be accomplished on-site at NIST.  The full service maintenance requirements are as follows:  (a) Planned Maintenance Service (PMs).   This service consists of , including but not limited to: (i) clean and inspect system, (ii) evaluate system performance, (iii) perform calibration and adjustments, (iv) image quality assessment, and (v) perform machine constants backup; (b) repair service and maintenance due to equipment malfunctions, as required; (c) lamp replacement; (d) parts replacement as required on an exchange or new part basis inclusive of labor; (e) software upgrades that are mandatory or safety related; and (g) repair parts, excluding consumables.   ASML  is the only company that has the capability to perform preventive maintenance on its own equipment as it is the only known source that has the level of senior technicians and a complete parts inventory that can provide this service.  The company has access to complete schematics which is proprietary and the detailed proprietary phototest procedures requirement to make the machine meet factory specifications.  The company also has access to special test fixtures and apparatus that make machine alignment and repair possible in the field.  ASML has a large spare parts inventory in Colorado Springs backed by overnight parts delivery.  These tools are extremely complicated electro-optical systems which make it difficult for third party sources to develop expertise and parts inventory to maintain an operational level required for doing 0.5 micrometer optical lithography.    This notice may represent the only official notice of the requirement.  See NOTE 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command-Picatinny has a requirement for the manufacture and delivery of 120 each Spade Dampers, beginning in the March 2005 time frame.  The spade dampers are for use in the Lightweight 155mm LW155) Howitzer.  The function of the spade dampers on the LW155 Howitzer is to absorb and dissipate recoil energy when the Howitzer is fired.  There are two spade dampers on the Howitzer, one for each spade.  The spade damper is designed to absorb approximately 60,000 lbs of force.  This significantly reduces the loads on the Howitzer structure, thereby increasing reliability and durability of the system. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate  a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis to Taylor Devices, Inc., Tonawanda, NY. The point of contact for this procurement is John Eilenberger, Contracting Officer, AMSTA-AQ-APG, BLDG. 9, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000; e-mail: jeilen@pica.army.mil.  See numbered notes 22 & 26.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Dycor Industries, 17944-106A Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta T5S1V3 for the purchase and delivery of equipment to provide enhanced capabilities for collecting biological simulants.  Twenty-four high volume (60 0 liters per minute) biological aerosol samplers will be purchased, which will allow for the collection of ovalbumin (OV  high molecular weight protein toxin simulant) and MS2 (viral simulant) at concentrations that will allow quantitative analysis for th e performance of point biological detection systems.  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1[b][1][ii] there is a reasonable basis to conclude that unique supplies or services are available from only one or a li mited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities; and FAR 6.302-1[b][2], the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or simila r circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source.  This authority is required because Dycor has supported the Canadian Government develop point biological detection systems and develop referee systems for biological simulants.   Through contracts, Dycor has provided a number of systems and software to support outdoor biological simulant trials.  Included were sampler control systems, sampler vacuum systems, equipment to radio activate remotely located equipment, unique software for collecting data for Aerodynamic Particle Sizers, and for manipulation of bioaerosol data related to outdoor simulant testing.  Dycor, the suggested vendor has been the sole source provider for much of the unique biological test equipment that has been utilized at Dugway because no other qualified vendors have been identified.  The primary control system for outdoor referee systems used at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) was produced by Dycor and is called CBNET.  The samplers proposed for this procurement a re compatible with the current CBNET software.  The XMX/27-10 has been designed utilizing the XMX high volume aerosol sampler.  The XMX is recognized as the most efficient bioaerosol collector currently available.  Additionally, the XMX/27-10 has been desi gned to collect a series of timed liquid samples that are designed to provide 15 second resolution of low concentration aerosolized biological simulants.  The proprietary rights to this biological collection system are owned by Dycor Technologies.  THIS IS  NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Supporting evidence must be furnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with the Government's requirements.  If no r esponses are received, the Government will proceed with sole source negotiations with Dycor Industries.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Research Triangle Institute, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194 to provide non-personal services to include aerosol system and swatch testing to support developmental test progra ms, system and swatch testing to support method development, and provide technical expertise on existing aerosol testing of chemical and biological individual protective equipment.  This support will include facilities and labor for conduct of testing, lab or intellectual support, travel and some documentation preparation as required.  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1[b][1][ii], unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.  This authority is required because Research Triangle Institute (RTI) is the only organization certified by the Chemical Defense Equipment Process Action Team (CDE-PAT) to conduct aer osol testing of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) for the Department of Defense.  The CDE-PAT was formed after the 1991 Gulf war by Mr. Hollis the deputy undersecretary of the Army for Operations Research (DUSA-OR) to look at the state of chemical defe nse equipment testing within the armed services.  As part of this initiative an Aerosol, Vapor, Liquid Action Group (AVLAG), comprised of key personnel from the development, test and evaluation communities, was established to review procedures and develop new test protocols.  The AVLAG developed swatch, MIST, and Aerosol methods, which were later validated by the National Science Foundation.  The Aerosol test method was only developed and validated at RTI, and ever since they have performed all aerosol test ing in support of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) development.  It is necessary to continue to have RTI conduct this testing in support of near term IPE developmental testing since no other test site could attain verification within the timeframe req uired to enable these programs to meet their schedule.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Supporting evidence must be furnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with the Government's requirements.

Complete various evaluations, studies, reports, and response actions as specified in the National Contingency Plan (NCP) found in 40 CFR 300.  Under this activity area, the Contractor will be requested to complete work in support of response and restoration actions.  Projects will be located at the New World Mine District, Cooke City, MT.  The work site is in a remote area.

Contractor is expected to be able to complete all needed work from the site investigation phase to development of construction bid package, construction oversight, and post-construction requirements.

All personnel for all activity areas who will physically work on a site shall be certified as having received at a minimum the 40-hour Hazardous Waste Site Operations training, in compliance with OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.120. 

All personnel who will physically work on a site under this activity shall be certified as having received the 40-hour Hazardous Waste Site Operations training, in compliance with OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and are current on the certification.  Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Montana will be required for EE/CA work, construction design, and technical assistance during construction work phases.

Project manager will be an experienced senior level person with at least ten (10) years experience in mining reclamation, groundwater and surface water reclamation, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liabilities Act actions.  Other selection criteria will be evaluated concerning streamline efficient organization (mix of core project staff including licenses); access to specialist on an as needed basis; location of project management personnel; knowledge of the New World Mining District and the geology, hydrogeology and high altitude reclamation concerns; specific work experience in high altitude mining reclamation projects; and working knowledge of Wyoming and Montana state water quality, waste disposal and appropriate environmental laws.

Projects will be negotiated prior to starting work and will be on an individual order basis for the period March 1, 2004, through March 1, 2005, with options to extend the services for up to four additional 12-month periods. 

                                                                     



SCOPE-OF-WORK

The work will include investigations and studies in support of response and restoration actions at the New World Mining District site.  The contractor will be expected to be familiar with all phases of time-critical and non-time critical removal actions as described in 40 CFR 300.  The types of work most likely to be ordered include the completion of site investigation and characterization studies, Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA), continuing water quality and vegetation monitoring, and construction design and support activities.

Site Investigation and Characterization

The contractor will be expected to perform field sampling to determine the level and extent of contamination and then, identify contamination pathways and targets at risk.  The contractor is expected to be familiar with EPA protocol, Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) requirements, and other applicable sampling requirements needed to produce the proper level of data quality.  The contractor will be expected to complete Sampling and Analysis Plans (SAP) and data quality objectives (DQOs) that will be reviewed and approved by the Forest Service and EPA.  

The Contractor shall assume financial responsibility for re-sampling if data is unusable because of identified problems with sampling techniques, handling or shipping problems, sampling requirements (insufficient sample material collected, inappropriate sample preservation, inappropriate sample location), laboratory error or laboratory contamination.

Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA)

The objective of the EE/CA is to present a preferred response action for a site.  The contractor is expected to be familiar with current technologies suitable for dealing with waste rock dumps, mill tailings, and other mine-related wastes.  In particular, the contractor is expected to have experience and be familiar with containment design, modeling of leachate quantities through various containment designs, and related reclamation practices.  

We expect the EE/CAs to be focused documents that evaluate in-depth a limited number of alternatives.  The streamlined risk assessments will include no more information than is needed to show a risk exists and a response action is justified.  In addition, the contractor needs to be familiar with Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) for each project and how to evaluate whether they need to be considered and then, if the proposed response action will meet them.

Construction Design and Support

The contractor will be expected to design a response action at a site.  This task will require the contractor to complete engineering plans and specifications that are suitable for bid advertisement.  The contractor will be expected to complete a Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC) plan, if needed, for the construction work.  The contractor may also be requested to review bid documents and construction submittals; and complete a final construction report, post construction monitoring plan, and an operation and maintenance plan.  

Timeframes

Tasks associated with this activity are, on the average, expected to be completed within the following timeframes:

Site Characterization Studies - 3 months
EE/CAs - 6 months
    Draft without preferred alternative - 4 months
    Work with Forest Service to develop preferred alternative - 1 month
    Complete final - 1 month
Designs completed - 4 months
    Submit 30% design - 1 month
    Submit 90% design - 2 months
    Submit final design - 1 month

QA/AC plan for construction - 1 month

However, specific timeframes for these tasks will be negotiated.
The Forest Service will generally return comments to the contractor within two weeks of receipt of a document.  The contractor will be responsible for incorporating all comments or explaining why a comment was not incorporated.

Other Tasks

Other tasks involve work in support of natural resource damage assessments, removal/remedial site evaluations, community relations (plans), action memorandums, serving as an on-site inspector during construction, inventory of suspected CERCLA sites, water quality and vegetation monitoring and reporting, and other related studies and field work.  Timeframes for these tasks will be negotiated. 

All Tasks

For all work ordered under this activity, the contractor will be expected to be familiar with affected and interested State agencies and laws/rules.  The contractor is expected to be familiar with applicable federal laws/regulations and the latest EPA guidance for any work requested under this activity.   

The contractor is expected to attend, participate, and possibly give presentations at internal and public meetings, when requested.  All personnel who will physically work on a site under this activity shall be certified as having received the 40-hour Hazardous Waste Site Operations training, in compliance with OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and are current on the certification.  Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Montana will be required for EE/CA work, construction design, and technical assistance during construction work phases.  A project safety plan will be submitted for the project and all appropriate personal protective equipment and safety equipment, as outlined in the plan, shall be provided.

These aircraft are an off-the-shelf version of the commercial DC-9 aircraft and differ slightly from the rest of commercial DC-9 fleet due to Navy unique modifications. Parts, material, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) maintenance documentation, manuals, and necessary OEM engineering source data are commercially available. However, there may be the necessity to maintain a licensing agreement with the OEM. The prime contractor and subcontractors must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. The primary performance objective is to provide the aircraft depot maintenance services necessary to meet the C-9B/DC-9 aircraft operational requirements. This also includes field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractors designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors. The contract type will be a requirements type contract with no minimum or maximum ordering requirements due to the uncertain number and timing of aircraft retirements. Contact information is as follows: mail to Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, RADM William A. Moffett Building, Attn:     Jason Lev, CODE:     2.4.3.1.1, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg, 2272, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1607 OR via email at jason.lev@navy.mil.     Electronic responses are preferred.

The School of Applied Information Technology (SAIT) was established as part of the FSI in October 1996.  The School of Applied Information Technology (SAIT) at the Foreign Service seeks a teaching authority that must certify SAIT instructors, to begin the process of becoming a MCT (Microsoft certified trainer) or CCT (CISCO certified trainer).  Microsoft and CISCO both accept CTT+ as accreditation in the process of becoming a MCT or CCT.  SAIT is an accredited Microsoft and CISCO partner.  Both corporations require the organization they partner with to have certified personnel before instructional material may be purchased from their respective headquarters.  FTE instructors rotate through SAIT positions and the new instructors must meet the requirements that allow SAIT to maintain their partnership status.  CTT+ is an important step in this process.    

All interested parties must respond in writing to wilkersondm@state.gov, by November 4, 2004.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command supports a Missile Defense Agency requirement for accomplishing lethality testing and assessments.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifi cation (HUBZone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, woman-owned, or large business) relative to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Eng ineering, and Life Sciences (size standard of 1,000 employees).  Small businesses may team together and be eligible for award.   This sources sought is to conduct market research and receive capability papers from interested businesses/teams.  Capability papers should include the following information:  size of company (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, SB, Veteran, all others), number of employees, relevant past performance on same/similar work and your company/team capability to do this type of work.  Documentation and technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company/team possess es the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Interested firms should submit an email and attach the capability statement within 15 days after the date of this announcement to shirley.wilkes@smdc.army.mil (titl e email 'Lethality Testing and Criteria Development').  Any questions can be directed to Ms. Wilkes.  If a solicitation is issued it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately fro m the responses to this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  Capability papers should address that the contractor or contractor team has the demonstrated ability to perform the entire task.  This effort will define kill modes, determine lethal damage requirements  (LDRs), and develop/validate lethality criteria for threat configurations designated as targets for the Ballistic Missile Defense System elements and components.  Near-term focus is on the Ground Based Midcourse Defense and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems.  This will be done through testing and analysis for current Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) systems and concepts but also may require the development of LDRs associated with targets for directed energy weapons or small yield nuclear weapons.  Determination of LDRs for the KEI, MKV, Aegis BMD and A BL systems are within the scope of this procurement.  The effort consists of designing, fabricating, instrumenting and testing models of threat payload targets and/or models of interceptors and kill enhancement devices such as rods and fragments.  First pr inciple computational analyses consisting of hydrocodes, and/or structural codes are required to develop pre-test predictions, interpret test data and design threat payload and interceptor test models.  These analytical techniques will also be utilized to extend the empirical database beyond current test capabilities and conduct parametric analyses.  Fast-running computer algorithms, which accurately model the critical parameters of the empirical database, are required in this effort for development of leth ality criteria, evaluations of interceptor lethality, and other parametric analyses.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The proposed acquisition may involve a potential conflict of interest as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 9.5.

<SUBJECT>B--Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma Settlement
<DESC>The Office of Historical Trust Accounting, an office within the Department of the Interior, was established pursuant to Secretarial Order No. 3231, on July 10, 2001, to plan for and direct the historical accounting of Individual Indian Money accounts.  OHTA's responsibilities were subsequently expanded to include accounting for tribal trust accounts.  The Government contemplates entering into a sole source contract with the Quapaw Information Systems, Inc, a not-for-profit tribal enterprise.  The primary purpose of the Contract is for the Contractor, in consultation with the Tribe, to gather and analyze certain information concerning Interior's management of  the Tribe's Tribal Trust Fund accounts and certain non-monetary Trust Assets located on selected Quapaw Indian trust lands.   Tthe Contractor will digitally organize and perform an analysis on  the documents in the Quapaw Collection and the DOI Mining Collection, and on any additional non-priviledged documents that the Contractor determines are necessary to collect for the purpose of preparing the Quapaw Analysis.  The Contractor will then assess whether there is enough information to prepare the Quapaw Analysis, the primary deliverable under this Contract.  The Quapaw Analysis will be a report that reflects the Contractor's detailed evaluation of the extent to which it, in consultation with the Tribe, believes Interior's management of certain Tribal Trust Fund accounts and Trust Assets is consistent with the criteria.   To be considered technically qualified to perform this requirement, any other contractor would have to be included in the Settlement Agreement between the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma and Interior, in the matter of Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma v. U.S. Department of the Interior, No. 02-CV-129-H(M) (N.D. Okla.) ("Settlement Agreement").   Note 22.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for an atomic force microscope (AFM) Characterization of Alkaline Earth Fluoride Adhesion Properties. Background: The NASA Glenn Research Center has requirements for a Contractor to perform adhesion tests in inert atmospheres to determine the effect of electrostatic forces on the material pairs.  This is a continuation of work which is a characterization of fluoride adhesion forces by AFM techniques.  This investigation is an extension of a training grant started in 1999, designed to characterize the flow properties of a composite solid lubricant powder. This work culminated in several publications, which determined that the flow properties of the powder blend were highly dependent upon the adhesion characteristics of one component, an alkaline earth fluoride (BaF2-CaF2). Another training grant was set up and test supplies were procured under this grant to study this problem in more detail using an atomic force microscope (AFM) with custom made probe tips composed of the material of interest.  The BaF2-CaF2 was supplied by NASA GRC and the Contractor purchased the probe tips. The Contractor then sifted through the material, harvesting 5 and 20µm particle sizes to mount on a batch of probes.  The particle sizes that were used in this testing were 5.21 and 17.1 µm.  To date, the Contractor has characterized the dependence of the adhesion properties on environmental humidity, which has resulted in a publication (Y.Y. Tsai, V. Nalladega, S. Sathish and M.K. Stanford, Evaluation of interactive forces between alkaline earth metal fluoride particles and single crystal substrate using atomic force microscopy, in Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5392, Testing, Reliability and Application of Micro- and Nano-Material Systems II, Norbert Meyendorf, George Y. Baaklini and Bernd Michel eds., SPIE, Bellingham, WA, 2004). Contractor Tasks: In this portion of the investigation, the Contractor shall investigate the adhesion forces obtained after producing an electrostatic charge on the probe tip to determine the effect of electrostatics, another typical mechanism that influences particle adhesion.  This task shall be carried out under the guidance of a research faculty member with approximately 18 years of experience in microscopic characterization of materials, and detailed knowledge of NASA requirements in this area.   The Contractor must supply the following: •	Atomized BaF2-CaF2 particles (5.12 µm and 17.1 µm for initial testing) •	Atomized BaF2-CaF2 particles (5 +/- 0.2 µm and 17 +/- .5 µm) •	Above atomized BaF2-CaF2 particles mounted on DNP style probe tips. •	Proof that the atomized BaF2-CaF2 particles they supply have the exact same surface chemistry characteristics as the batch supplied to the Contractor for  the previous investigation.  This is mandatory for comparison to previous results. The probe tips must be supplied by the Contractor with these specifically sized BaF2-CaF2 particles mounted:  5.12 µm and 17.1 µm for the initial tests for comparison with previously reported results.  Also a complete batch of probes mounted with   BaF2-CaF2 particles:  5 µm +/- 1 µm and 17 µm +/- 2 µm must be available if needed to complete the investigation.	This work must be started by November 15, 2004 and shall be completed by September 30, 2005. The Contractor shall perform these basic steps for this investigation: •	Calibration of AFM cantilever spring stiffness. •	Measurement of adhesion forces of 5.21µm and 17.1µm particles (mounted on DNP probes) with imposed electrostatic charge. •	Comparison of these adhesion forces with those measured without imposed electrostatic charging (reference op. cit.). •	If needed to complete the investigation, measurement of adhesion forces with imposed electrostatic charge of other particle mounted probes in the same size range as stated previously. Deliverables: The deliverables for this task shall be the following: •	Progress will be checked on an informal basis approximately once per month. •	The end product is a publication, which shall include all methods and procedures used to complete the study and report the results of adhesion forces of atomized BaF2-CaF2 particles with electrostatic charge compared with these particles without the electrostatic charge, for submission to a peer reviewed journal. Period of Performance: The period of performance for this effort shall be through September 30, 2005. **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THEIR QUOTATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE STATEMENT OF WORK** The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-24.
