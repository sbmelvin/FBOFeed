Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR 52.209-1. AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALFICATION. For qualification information/source approval request contact Thomas Barron, DLA-Aviation/AOB at extension (405) 739-9632. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  The Competition Advocate (CA) at each contracting activity/office (as defined in DLAD 2.101) shall act as the ombudsman and attempt to resolve contractor complaints.  DLA AVIATION - AOB's CA/ombudsman can be reached at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Hood (MICC-FH) intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price contract authorized under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), as implemented by FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii) to LHS Productions, Inc. dba VideoBank, 260 Union St, Northvale, NJ, 07647-2208 for Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) Logistical Support services. The Field Service Representative (FSR) shall provide onsite system administration and operational support for registered DAMS users; train users on the overall use and functionality of the system and its components; perform system technology refresh updates;  troubleshoot and resolve hardware or software interoperability issues; communicate with the contractor's home office's in-house support staff to resolve any on-site issues with hardware or software; perform on-site repairs related to third party hardware or software that is part of the DAMS; provide technical advice to the COR and DAMS users on all aspects of the system;  assure continued up-time of all system functionalities; install and configure system upgrades; and  periodically perform quality control testing for all hardware and software components. The current DAMS is complex and unique. LHS Productions, Inc. dba VideoBank is the only contractor capable of providing support. DAMS software contains VideoBank proprietary code which is a key portion for the overall system functionality. To award the contract to another company, would require that company to fully understand the operation of the VideoBank's proprietary software code which would incur greater expense to the government that could not be recovered through competition. The Period of Performance is a Base year plus four one-year options. The NAICS code is 541511 with a size standard of $25.5 million. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency, directly to the Contract Specialist, Mark Ramey, at mark.a.ramey10.civ@mail.mil, and the Contracting Officer, Belinda Woods, belinda.woods.civ@mail.mil, no later than 2:00 PM CST 22 July 2014. Submissions by other means will not be evaluated or considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/ISB, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Novatris Vaccines and Diagnostics, 4560 Horton Street, Emeryville, CA 94608, to procure, store, and ship Bexsero&reg; (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Novartis is the only contractor that manufactures this vaccine. Due to their unique position as the manufacturer of the vaccine and in order to assure the maximum available shelf-life for CDC's vaccines (at least until November 2015), the vaccines must remain in the possession of the manufactuer. Further, there is not currently a licensed vaccine for serogroup B (MenB) meningococcal disease in the US; however, the investigational Men B vaccine is currently under development by Novartis Vaccines. This vaccine has recently been granted a Breakthrough Therapy dsignation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Until a licensed Men B vaccine is available in the US, use of an unlicensed vaccine under a CDC-sponsored Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol is necessary to control MenB outbreaks. The goal is to maintain a minimum shelf-life of 12 months on the vaccines in order to ensure readiness to deploy the stockpile for disease response. As the manufacturer, Novartis is the only vendor with a market large enough to produce, store, and ship the stockpiled vaccines to maintain a viable stockpile.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 7 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to David Dombeck, Contracting Specialist, Reference 2014-73803, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: David Dombeck, MS: K-14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 7 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Novartis, as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

The solicitation will issue unrestricted using other than full and open competition under 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1). The government's required delivery is 300 days. Inspection / Acceptance at Destination, F.O.B. Origin. First Destination Transportation applies. This solicitation is a RFP and will be available at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil on the issue date of July 22, 2014. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available, and must be downloaded from the internet site above. This solicitation will contain price breaks up to 250 each but will not contain a quantity option. The approved source for this procurement is Natel (09059) P/N 10270107.
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />This item has technical data some or all of which is subject to export-control regulations. Eligibility for award is limited to suppliers qualified through JCP or licensed by either the department of state or commerce; or to foreign suppliers pursuant to international agreements. <br />This item requires Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) marking. Only DNA trusted sources that agree to DNA mark Federal Supply Classification (FSC) 5962 Electronic Microcircuits IAW DLAD 52.211-9074 are eligible to receive an award. <br />DLA will only award contracts to trusted sources for FSC 5962. Trusted sources are defined as either an Original Component Manufacturer (OCM), a supplier on the Qualified Supplier List of Distributors (QSLD), an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), an authorized distributor, a supplier on the Qualified Manufacturers List (QML), a manufacturer on the Qualified Products List (QPL), a supplier on the Qualified Testing Suppliers List (QTSL), or the manufacturer of emulated parts.

The awardee shall provide proof of purchase of the DNA marking costs within the time frame listed in the contract line item(s). Costs shall be based on a firm quote from Applied DNA Sciences equal to or less than Applied DNA Science's preferred price list for DLA suppliers. Those trusted sources that choose to use an approved third party marker may be reimbursed for certain charges that may be applied by Applied DNA Sciences. <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 5, has a requirement to repair the approximate 50 foot wide breach in the 7-foot high embankment dam, and excavate a new emergency spillway.  The dam repairs will enable the dam to safely pass the inflow design flood, the 100-year rainfall event, without over-topping. The total excavation is approximately 5,000 CY of soil and rock/boulder. Suitable excavated materials will be used to raise the existing embankment dam height approximately 2.6 feet along most of the 1900-foot long dam.  In addition, the existing 1-foot wide concrete walls of the outlet (service spillway) will be raised 1.6 feet to match the increased dam height. A new walkway over the service spillway will also be installed.  A 10-foot wide articulated concrete block mat will be placed across the new emergency spillway to provide one lane vehicle access to the dam.
This contract opportunity is a total set aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code is 237990. The small business size standard is $33.5 million. The estimated magnitude of construction for this project is between $250,000 to $500,000. Registration is required on the System for Award Management (SAM online at www.sam.gov) website. Failure to register in the SAM database may deem an offeror ineligible for award.
The solicitation will be released through www.fbo.gov and www.fedconnect.net on or about July 22, 2014. No hard copies of the solicitation will be sent out by this office. The anticipated contract type will be firm fixed price. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Evaluation factors will be set forth in the solicitation. Please check the solicitation for all required documentation to be submitted. All interested contractors are encouraged to visit the site. Instructions and contact information for site visits will be included in the solicitation.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB), plans to procure on a sole source basis a Photodynamic Diagnostic D-Light C (PDD) System from Karl Storz Endoscopy, 2151 E. Grand Avenue, El Segundo, CA 90245.
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Delivery of the instrument shall occur 90 Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), The Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB) conducts clinical and basic research designed to develop better methods for detection, prevention, and therapy of patients with genitourinary malignancies. Its primary focus is the study of the genes associated with initiation and progression of kidney, prostate, and bladder cancers. UOB is expanding its bladder cancer program to focus on the development of better methods for diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. The UOB bladder cancer program is focusing on studying the molecular genetic changes associated with superficial and invasive bladder cancer and in developing novel methods for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of this disease.</p>
<p>To fulfill UOB's mission and objective, UOB needs equipment that can provide the technology for better detection, and subsequently treatment, of bladder cancers. The treatment of bladder cancers is often associated with a high rate of recurrence. In patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, fluorescence cystoscopy can improve the detection and ablation of bladder tumors. Karl Storz Endoscopy is the only provider of the Photodynamic Diagnostic D-Light C (PDD) System, which is indicated for photodynamic blue light cystoscopy, as an adjunct to white light cystoscopy for the detection of non-muscle invasive papillary cancer of the bladder in patients suspected or known to have lesion(s) on the basis of prior cystoscopy. The PDD System allows application of an improved technique in detecting bladder cancer and offers a new tool in the management and treatment of bladder cancer that may increase the detection of lesions not well seen under white light examination. Improved detection of bladder tumors has proven beneficial by allowing for a more complete initial resection.</p>
<p>The system includes:</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-11-G-0001 to The Boeing Company (Boeing), P.O. Box 3707, 7755 East Marginal Way, Seattle, WA 98124-2499, on an other than full and open competition basis for development of an interface for the exchange of data between the P-8A Increment 3 Applications Based Architecture (ABA) system and the P-8A Baseline Architecture in support of data automation, capability upgrades, and integration. The outputs and deliverables from this planned order will support the P-8A Increment 3 Technology Development competitive procurement posted in FedBizOpps under Solicitation Number: N00019-13-R-0045. The estimated period of performance of this effort is 27 months after contract award (currently estimated to occur in 1QFY14). This contract action requires expertise in P-8A engineering, integration, and testing and requires Boeing proprietary data to perform. A sole source acquisition will be procured under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the Boeing P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of the avionics systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements within the required delivery schedule. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed delivery order modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail, or facsimile to the attention of Scott Segesdy using the contact information provided in this synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing directly.

<a href="mailto:matthew.schupbach@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SPAWARSYSCEN Pacific) hereby publicizes its intention to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole-source contract with General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. (GDC4S) of Scottsdale, AZ.
This action will provide approximately 6,372 specifically fabricated power supplies for KG-175D National Security Agency (NSA) certified Type-1 cryptographic equipment. The DON KG-175D equipment was procured from GDC4S in calendar year 2008 and 2009 with an accompanying five year warranty. In order to supply the KG-175D with power, three different models of power supplies were provided with the equipment. An evaluation of returned power supplies concluded that two of the three models have a history of failing to provide adequate power to run the cryptographic equipment. The only known model power supply currently available that both meets the needs of the Navy and is fielded with no failures reported is the Powerbox model PBUS0015, which is manufactured by Powerbox in accordance with proprietary specifications owned by GDC4S.  The Government has no data rights to the GDC4S developed specifications. Even though Model PBUS0015 is manufactured by Powerbox, it must be purchased through GDC4S, as it owns documentation that outlines all manufacturing specifications required for the power supply (amp, watt, voltage, size, connector pin-out, over voltage shut off, environmental, and other requirements to allow it to function and meet required National Security Agency (NSA) and military environmental standards).
Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) and (b)(2), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Other manufactured power supplies not using the required specifications cannot be guaranteed to work, as they have a history of failing to power the equipment and are not built to the exact instruction identified in the GDC4S document. Use of any other model power supply would adversely impact the Fleet's ability to meet its mission and protect classified networks, as cryptographic equipment needs constant and adequate power to function as needed. The Powerbox model PBUS0015 has also been through extensive NSA testing with the KG- 175D Type-1 cryptographic equipment and meets certification requirements. Testing is required by NSA to certify equipment for use by Government entities to process classified information, and is limited to the specific product, manufacturer, and configuration of the product tested.

Since the Powerbox PBUS0015 model power supply is manufactured based on a proprietary specification to meet the requirements of the KG-175D Type-1 cryptographic equipment, there is no currently available power supply substitute. Therefore, it has been determined that GDC4S is the only source that can provide replacement power supplies without incurring unacceptable delays and additional testing costs that are not expected to be recovered by competition.
Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing this equipment may be considered by the agency. Interested parties shall identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, and must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any capabilities, comments, questions, or concerns regarding this notice may be submitted IN WRITING via e-mail to matthew.schupbach@navy.mil. A determination by the Government to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Section 206 Ecosystem Restoration Project <br>  <br> The project is an ecosystem restoration project located along Boulder Creek in Boulder County, Colorado.  The work reach along Boulder Creek is located between N. 109th Street at the west limit to just west of N. 115th Street/Kenosha Road at the east limit.  The work in general consists of: 1) excavating a new meandering channel (2-yr bank-full) for Boulder Creek, 2) excavating floodplain benches of various widths, approximating 150 feet, along the new meandering channel, 3) filling the abandoned portion of the existing Boulder Creek channel in conjunction with grading the floodplain benches, 4) constructing shallow pools, cobble riffles, cobble point bars, and large woody debris points in the new channel, reestablishing stream diversity for fish habitat and other aquatic life, and 5) providing plantings on the bank-full channel slopes and floodplain benches to recreate a riparian community with diverse native species.  The new meandering Boulder Creek channel and associated ecosystem restoration work has an approximately length of 6,100 feet.  The new bank-full (2-yr.) channel has an approximately top of bank width of 58 feet. <br> Constructing the meandering Boulder Creek channel project will involve: excavation of approximately 160,000 cubic yards of soil, weathered rock, and topsoil; on-site and nearby off-site disposal of approximately 125,000 cubic yards of surplus excavated soil and weathered rock; removal (clearing and grubbing) of designated trees and shrubs; salvaging and transplanting of designated trees; removal of fence line; installation of approximately 4,600 linear feet of 4-strand barbed wire fence; construction of a 24-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipe culvert (72 linear feet) with FES inlet structure and C-I-P outlet structure; and construction of various erosion protection features within the project site.  The project will also require the seeding and planting of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants on approximately 41 acres of project land; seeding approximately 12 acres of disposal areas; and subsequent care of that vegetation to ensure its establishment.  <br>  <br> (Quantities are Approximate) <br>  <br> The estimated construction cost of this project is between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000. <br>

<CONTACT>Jeffrey Renner, 503.808.4630

<a href="mailto:jeff.s.renner@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Portland</a>
<DESC>BACKGROUND <br> The mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) is located at the river's confluence with the Pacific Ocean between Oregon and Washington and is known as one of the most treacherous coastal inlets in the world. Consistent navigation through MCR bar was finally secured by construction of three rubble-mound jetties, which included the North Jetty. Since initial construction, approximately 2,100 feet of the North Jetty head has deteriorated and is no longer functional. Structural degradation of the North Jetty has accelerated in recent years because of storm activity, loss of sand shoal material at its foundation, and continued recession of the jetty head. Along with the degredation of the jetty itself, the landward side of the North Jetty between stations 10+00 to 60+00 is eroding and has created a depression, or tidal lagoon, that fills with water on the incoming tide. This lagoon appears to be formed primarily by the erosion and piping of accreted sand with tidal exchange and wave surge through the deteriorated jetty structure. Surface water flow and groundwater flow from McKenzie Head Lagoon on the north side of Jetty Road also likely contributes to the loss of material through the jetty. <br>  <br> PROJECT DESCRIPTION <br> The work includes filling the lagoon with sand and rock fill up to an elevation of 15 feet NAVD88. The lagoon fill work includes construction of a filter zone (consisting of riprap, shot rock, and gravel) adjacent to the jetty stone to prevent sand migration through the jetty, followed by upland bulk filling with imported and on-site borrow sand. An Erosion Protection zone shall also be part of the lagoon fill at it's west end. On-site borrow sand will be excavated from the borrow area at the eastern part of the site. The resulting borrow pit shall be reclaimed as an intertidal wetland. In addition, an existing 48 inch diameter corrugated culvert that extends under Jetty Road, and associated with the McKenzie Head Lagoon system, shall be replaced, and the road surface repaired in the culvert area. Guardrails shall also be installed associated with the culvert replacement work. Construction shall meet all environmental restrictions. The sequence of construction shall accommodate high tides, storms, and groundwater levels. <br>  <br> LOCATION <br> The work shall be located landward and north of the North Jetty, between jetty stations 10+00 and 60+00.  The North Jetty is located at Cape Disappointment State Park (formerly Fort Canby State Park) in Pacific County, Washington, near the town of Ilwaco.  Access to the site from Ilwaco is by way of Highway 101, which connects to State Route 100, which connects to Fort Canby Road, which connects to Jetty Road, as shown on drawings.  Contractor access to the work site will be from Jetty Road. <br> Project Street/Location: Cape Disappointment State Park, Jetty Road <br> Nearest City: Ilwaco <br> State: Washington <br> ZIP Code: 98624 <br> County: Pacific <br> Latitude:  <br> 1.46o16'42.17'' N (degrees, minutes, seconds) - east end of Lagoon <br> 2. 46o16'21.09'' N (degrees, minutes, seconds) - west end of Lagoon  <br> Longitude: <br>  1.124o03'45.17'' W (degrees, minutes, seconds) - east end of lagoon <br> 1. 124o04'21.53'' W (degrees, minutes, seconds) - west end of lagoon <br>  <br> PROCUREMENT METHOD <br> This is an 8(a) Competitive Acquisition limited to firms in the Portland District SBA 8(a) Portfolio.  Point of Contact for small business questions or assistance is the Portland District Deputy for Small Business, Carol McIntyre at 503-808-4602 or Carol.A.Mcintyre@usace.army.mil.  The small business size standard for NAICS 237990 is $33.5 million.  Magnitude of Construction is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. In accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, a best value tradeoff process will be used when selecting an awardee. The government may consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror but ONLY when benefits merit additional cost. For this procurement non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price. <br>  <br> TIMELINE <br>  <br> A formal solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about 01 AUGUST 2014.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) requirement for a charge-coupled device (CCD) Camera.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The CCD Camera is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within a device such as a transmission electron microscope to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value or a digital image. The CCD is a major piece of technology in digital imaging and CCD image sensors are widely used in professional, medical, and scientific applications where high-quality image data is required. A CCD camera gets rid of arbitrary gray levels in favor of photoelectron counts, a meaningful standard that scientists can use for comparing their imaging systems and their image-based data. The CCD camera will be used to capture high resolution images of foodborne microbial pathogens, interacting among themselves, with human tissue culture cells, or within tissues of infected animals. Furthermore, these images provide essential support for projects on nanomaterials (nanogold, nanosilver), microbial attachment to fresh produce and toxicity of chemicals to kidneys or other organs (melamine and cyanuric acid, silver ions). It is anticipated that these results will improve recovery and detection of Cronobacter sakazakii from infant formula, improve specificity, and the time to characterize and sub-type food pathogens. CCD cameras useful in electron microscopy shall meet the following minimum performance requirements:</p>
<p>Performance requirement:</p>
<p>General specifications:</p>

The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.<br /><br />As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through FedBizOpps. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase the Mantis Liquid Dispenser. <br />The NCI, CCR, Developmental Therapeutics Branch (DTB) focuses on the discovery and the molecular pharmacology of novel anticancer agents. Human tyrosyl phosphodiesterase 1 and 2 proteins (TDP1 and TDP2) are novel rational anticancer targets involved in the repair of DNA lesions created by the trapping of human DNA topoisomerase I and II (Top1 and Top2) following treatment by anticancer agents such as camptothecin and etoposide. Experimental observations suggest that the use of TDP1 with Top1 inhibitors or TDP2 with Top2 inhibitors in a combinational regimen are synergistic. DTB has developed a drug development effort for the discovery TDP1 and TDP2 specific inhibitors. <br /><br />The DTB has implemented several high throughput-screening (HTS) assays to discover TDP1 and TDP2 specific inhibitors. These plate-based assays are run in a 384-well format and require the handling of a large number of plates. The acquisition of a Mantis Liquid Dispenser is required for the DTB to continue its successful drug development effort for the discovery TDP1 and TDP2 specific inhibitors.<br /><br />The following salient characteristics apply to the Mantis Liquid Dispenser:
<p>&bull; Capable of dispensing any volume of any ingredient into any plate well.<br />&bull; Capable of automatically dispensing up to 6 reagents in parallel without manual intervention.<br />&bull; Capable of dispensing with precision volumes as low as 100 nanoliters, without upper volume limit.<br />&bull; Capable of filling and dispensing as rapidly as 10 times per second.<br />&bull; Capable of a low dead volume of 6 microliters.<br />&bull; Capable of dispensing volumes from 5 microliters to 2000 microliters in an uninterrupted stream.<br />&bull; Capable of dispensing DMSO reagents via use of perfluoroelastomer chips.<br />&bull; Capable of dispensing DNase, RNase, and protease free solutions with molecular biology grade chips tested to be free of contamination.<br />&bull; Provides accurate and precise non-contact delivery of desired volumes of liquids into wells via patented micro-diaphragm pump technology.<br />&bull; Liquid can be dispensed in 96, 384 and 1536 well microplates, as well as deepwell blocks and vials.<br />&bull; Capable of high precision with CV's of &lt; 3% for silicone based diaphragm chips and &lt; 5% for PFE and Continuous Flow chips.<br />&bull; Provides software that is extremely user friendly and allows for simple drag and drop experimental design. Standard gradient and backfill buttons make designing an experiment even easier and faster.<br />&bull; Offers a very small footprint with dimensions of: 212 mm (8.35") x 175 mm (6.89") x 230 mm (9.06") only needing to be connected to a regular power source and computer. As a result, the instrument hardly takes space in the lab, and can easily be moved to other lab spaces in a matter of minutes if and when needed without any support that would need to be paid for.<br />&bull; Offers the following cost and time savings: <br />- low volume dispensing saving precious reagents, <br />- low dead volume saving precious reagents, <br />- no clogging issues preventing failed experiments saving reagents<br />- no learning curve for software operation and experimental <br />- fast dispensing of higher volumes with Continuous Flow option,<br />- no consumables as chips can be washed and reused.<br />&bull; Offers built-in dual wash stations to allow easy fluid pathway cleaning <br /><br />How to Submit a Response:</p>

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research, in this regard. Since 1994, the NIA have investigated changes in brain structure and function as predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer Disease (AD) through longitudinal neuroimaging assessments of selected participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and neuropsychological testing have been performed annually or biennially for the neuroimaging substudy participants, aged 55 and older. Since 2005 we have performed amyloid imaging studies with PET and 11C-PiB for approximately 125 individuals to date with more than 300 scans and up to 7 repeated assessments. With the recent development of radiotracers to image tau/neurofibrillary tangle pathology in vivo with PET, the current procurement aims to acquire PET Tau imaging in participants who will receive amyloid imaging, approximately 50 BLSA studies per year. The addition of PET Tau imaging will allow us to measure both pathological hallmarks of AD in well-characterized BLSA participants and will allow prospective investigation of the temporal trajectories of these pathologies in relation to longitudinal memory change.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: <br />The purpose of this project is to acquire services to perform and quantify in vivo PET scans using a radiotracer that binds the Tau pathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. This study will include approximately 50 PET Tau scans per year of participants from the BLSA, who are also undergoing PET amyloid imaging studies. The Scientific Aims are to (1) investigate changes in both amyloid and tau pathology in relation to memory change and the development of cognitive impairment; and (2) identify possible protective factors which prevent or delay the onset of cognitive impairment in individuals who maintain normal cognition despite substantial Alzheimer's type neuropathology measured by in vivo PET imaging.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The purpose of this project is to acquire services to perform and quantify in vivo brain PET scans of Tau pathology, using a radiotracer that binds Alzheimer's type tau pathology. Initial studies of changes in tau pathology will be conducted using PET and 18F-T807 from Avid Pharmaceuticals (Lilly). The Contractor shall acquire the PET Tau neuroimaging scans and shall provide sophisticated quantitative analysis of imaging data, using kinetic modeling techniques. Quantitative results shall include data with and without MRI-based partial volume correction. Structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging brain scans necessary for any image analysis will be acquired by the NIA-IRP at the NIA 3T MRI facility and will be provided to the Contractor for image processing and analysis. The Contractor also shall be responsible for:</p>
<p>&bull; Assistance with scheduling the PET scan studies</p>
<p>&bull; Assistance with preparation and review of regulatory documents, including materials to meet Institutional Review Board, FDA, and radiation safety regulatory requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacture of a customized thermoplastic mask for each participant for use with a compatible head-holder to reduce participant motion</p>
<p>&bull; Capability of producing PET radiotracers approved for human administration</p>
<p>&bull; Radioisotope administration</p>
<p>&bull; Medical monitoring of participants during PET scan procedures</p>
<p>&bull; Provide parking coupon to research participants where necessary</p>
<p>The Contractor must be located in close proximity to the NIA Intramural Research Program in Baltimore Maryland to allow PET neuroimaging studies to be conducted in conjunction with regular BLSA visits. Moreover, close proximity is also necessitated by the need for frequent visits to the imaging facility by the Project Officer or his designate to monitor the PET scan acquisitions.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: September 2014 through September 2015 with four (4) additional 12-month option periods. .</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541380 with a Small Business Size Standard $14.0 M for an upcoming requirement for the National Water Quality Lab, in Denver, CO to provide radiochemical analysis of water, sediment, and other materials.
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 
This requirement is for Radiochemical Analyses of waters, suspended material, and sediment material. These requirements are to include but not limited to gross alpha/ gross beta (72 hr and 30 day recount), Ra-226, Ra-228, Ra-224, isotopic uranium, plutonium, and thorium, gamma, Po-210, Am-241, and Pb-210 dating of core samples. Technical Requirements for Radiochemical Analyses for the USGS are to include but not limited to the following: 1.Dating of core samples reporting the following isotopes and MDCs- Cs-137  0.05 pCi/g Pb-210  0.1 pCi/g Ra-226  0.4 pCi/g 2.Ra-226 by the Radon Emanation Technique (EPA Method 903.1) with a MDC of 0.1 pCi/L 3.Ra-224 and Ra-226 by alpha spec with a MDC of 1.0 pCi/L for each 4.Isotopic uranium (U-234, U-235, U-238), Am-241, isotopic plutonium (Pu-238, Pu-239/Pu-240) all by alpha spec with a MDC of 0.1 pCi/L for each 5.Radon by ASTM Method D 5072 with a MDC of 50 pCi/L
Each result is to be accompanied by a one sigma Combined Standard Uncertainty (CSU), a sample specific Minimum Detectable Concentration (ssMDC), and a sample specificcritical level (ssLc). The CSU, ssMDC, and SSLc are to be calculated using the equation in MARLAP. Reports are to consist of a full data package as well as an Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) QA/QC Criteria 1.  A blank, LCS, and duplicate shall be run with each batch (not to exceed 10) samples. 2.  The blank shall not exceed the ssLc. 3.  Yields shall be less than 100% plus 2 times the standard uncertainty of the yield but shall not be less than 60%. 4.  LCS recoveries shall be less than 100% plus 2 x the recovery CSU, but shall not be less than 80%. 5.  The ssLc shall be approximately one-half of the ssMDC for each analysis.
Because the National Water Quality laboratory (NWQL) is NELAC accredited, any laboratories for analytical contracts administered through the NWQL must also, when applicable, be NELAC accredited. This accreditation is to cover all analyses, listed in the contract, for which accreditation is available.

<DESC>NASAs Technology for Software Defined Radio Request for Information <p> Important Notice:  This RFI notice is open to all interested parties. 1	Introduction: <p> In 2002, as the Department of Defense Joint Tactical Radio Systems program was in development, routine deployment of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) for NASA missions was a new concept. This was primarily due to the limitations of reconfigurable components useable for space radios.  The need to reduce the cost and risk of using SDRs was identified and a multi-center NASA team was created to investigate SDR technology and the development of a software abstraction layer, similar to the Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS)s Software Communication Architecture (SCA) concept, to enable porting of applications among platforms.  This led to the development of the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture.   The STRS architecture for software-defined radios (SDRs) is an open architecture for NASA space and ground radios. STRS provides a common, consistent framework to abstract the application software from the radio platform hardware to reduce the cost and risk of using complex reconfigurable and reprogrammable radio systems across NASA missions. It achieves this objective by defining an architecture to enable the reuse of applications (waveforms and services implemented on the SDR) across heterogeneous SDR platforms and reduce dependence on a single vendor.	The Standard provides a detailed description and set of requirements to implement the architecture. The Standard focuses on the key architecture components and subsystems by describing their functionality and interfaces for both the hardware and the software, including the applications. <p> In 2007, the STRS architecture was determined to be ready for flight implementation in a technology development project.  This project was originally called the Communication, Navigation, and Networking reConfigurable Testbed  (CoNNeCT).  CoNNeCT was later renamed the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed.	Three SDRs, compliant with the STRS architecture, were procured in 2008 and 2009 for the SCaN Testbed, using the architecture defined in a technical memorandum and referred to in the procurement specifications as STRS Architecture Standard Release 1.02.1. The SCaN Testbed was launched in July 2012 and operates on an external truss on the International Space Station (ISS).	 <p> The SCaN Testbed is an experimental communications system that provides the capability for S Band, Ka-Band, and L-Band communication with space and ground assets. Investigation of SDR technology and the STRS architecture are the primary focus of the SCaN Testbed.  As a completely reconfigurable testbed, the SCaN Testbed provides experimenters an opportunity to develop and demonstrate experimental waveforms and applications for communication, networking, and navigation concepts and to advance the understanding of operating SDRs in space.   Lessons learned from the platform provider, application developers, and integrators of the SCaN Testbed provided critical insight for the development of the current Standard, NASASTD-4009.  <p> Many of the original concepts for the design, development, and use of SDRs for NASA missions has progressed significantly since the original development of STRS and updates to the architecture are being considered.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit input from industry, academia, and other government agencies about the current and future SDR capabilities, hardware and software architectures, and recommended enhancements to STRS for the development of SDR applications.  <p> The information received through this RFI will be used by NASA to enhance the STRS architecture, and improve the processes for application development and reuse for SDRs. There will not be a follow-on funded solicitation directly from this RFI.  Multiple NASA centers will review the responses, providing an opportunity to increase NASAs awareness of the respondents efforts in the Software Defined Radio area. 2	Objectives: <p> The primary objective of the RFI is to solicit information in the following three areas: <p> 1.	Investigate the State of the Art of near-term, space applicable Software Defined Radio technology.  2.	Understand the barriers to establishing a developer community to create or reuse applications for NASA communication systems. 3.	Gather information on the technologies and concepts that will enable space-based communication systems in the near future (~10 years).  The following concepts for NASA missions should be considered: a.	Cognitive radio and networking b.	Optical c.	Integrated optical and Radio Frequency(RF) d.	Security e.	Cost and risk reduction f.	Considerations for extreme environments g.	Safety/mission critical h.	Integrated platform with multiple functions (science processing) i.	Sharing on-board computational resources 4.	Recommend updates to the current version of the STRS architecture NASA-STD-4009. The STRS architecture standard NASA-STD-4009 and accompanied handbook NASA-HDBK-4009 can be found at the NASA Standards website located at <A HREF="https://standards.nasa.gov">https://standards.nasa.gov </A>   , click NASA Developed Standards and scroll down to the appropriate document.	Additional information on the STRS architecture are available at <A HREF="https://strs.grc.nasa.gov">https://strs.grc.nasa.gov </A>	  . 3	Scenarios: <p> The following two potential scenarios for the use of SDRs in NASA missions are provided for consideration when answering the subsequent questions. <p> Relay spacecraft <p> The following scenario represents a future relay spacecraft operations and demonstrates the complexity of future radios in a networked space environment. <p> A spacecraft is performing as a relay point in a communications network, where it orbits the body of interest every 20 -120 minutes.  Since the spacecraft is also doing science measurements, the orbit changes to accommodate the science measurements.  However, at any given time, the spacecraft knows where it is and what its orbit is. <p> As the orbiter flies over the surface, it can establish short range links with landed assets or other orbiters.  The range of these links may be anywhere from a few tens of km, in which case the period of visibility is short (a few minutes) or tens of thousands of km, in which case the period of visibility is longer (and potentially infinite, if the orbit period matches the rotation period of the body, as with a Clarke orbit on earth). <p> It is expected that these short range links are established automatically, and data is transferred in both directions with some sort of error detection and retry protocol. There is significant multipath fading due to surface topography and the pattern of the antenna on both ends of the link.  For some of the passes, the relay satellite may not get very high above the horizon, but if there is high priority data to send, then it should be sent as soon as possible.  For other data, a longer latency may be appropriate, and a later pass with better geometry (higher elevation, better antenna available, longer duration) might be used.  The decision about how and when to send the data is autonomous, without needing ground commanding. <p> Any of the assets may have a high or medium gain antenna which can be pointed appropriately (and autonomously), and the decision about which antenna to use, and where to point it, should be made autonomously on the basis of the data needing to be sent, with some sort of Quality of Service (QoS) metric.  Note that a given communication opportunity may start with low gain omni antennas, and after the link is established, the fact that one end has high priority data to send would cause a shift to a higher gain antenna that can support the link. The higher gain antenna may not necessarily be on the end of the link with the data to be sent. <p> There may be multiple other spacecraft/rovers/astronauts within the field of regard of the relay spacecraft at the same time, all needing to communicate at the same time, in the same band, perhaps even in the same channel, so the physical layer (PHY) and media access control (MAC) communications protocols should accommodate this capability.  On the other hand, the two end points may have wildly disparate capability: one may be a legacy asset using an old protocol and link layer, and the other a newer one, so the ability to support two different protocol stacks on the same RF band/channel is important. <p> Each of the endpoints will have protocols that change.	For example, a lander may use some protocol like Prox-1 normally, but in the event of an emergency, it reverts to a legacy safe mode with low bit rate, lots of coding, and transmitting in the blind. The orbiter must be able to recognize that this has occurred, and shift its demodulation strategy appropriately, and be able to forward this presumably high priority traffic as appropriate (either on a Direct to Earth backbone consisting of both RF and optical links, or, perhaps if two astronauts are communicating via the relay, to the other astronaut). <p> Since SDRs can also serve as science instruments doing radio science, radars, or navigation measurements, they should be doing that while communications are occurring, or during the intervals between comm passes.  Naturally, the scheduling of these should be autonomous, in response to a priori task lists. <p> The  orbiter may also be carrying a high precision clock, or may be able to get high precision time and frequency data from its direct to earth link, or from another asset. It should be able to pass that on to the other assets, so that the entire network is on a common time basis and long term frequency drift can be accommodated without requiring expensive oscillators on all the spacecraft. <p> Both orbiter and lander should be able to make use of navigation signals (which may be the comm signals as well, assuming they are well known enough) to determine their positions, which in turn should be used to autonomously build connection graphs and link schedules. <p> All of this should require minimum commanding intervention, other than to set the overall priorities for the data flow, and perhaps to set limits and/or caps on data.  The establishment of links, and deciding which data to send over which links, should be autonomous. <p> Constellation of Cubesats <p> NASA is currently investigating the capability to deploy up to 11 cubesats from the first Space Launch System (SLS) flight in 2017.  The cubesats could be deposited in deep space, close to the moon and beyond.  Previously, cubesats have been limited to balloon, sounding rocket and orbital fights, but this SLS opportunity would open up the possibility for significantly enhanced science.  However, cubesats in deep space also present unique complexities and challenges, especially in the transmission of meaningful and timely science data to Earth.  Given this, NASA is interested in technologies that may be useful to allow data transfer and telemetry at the MBps rate from 6U-sized cubesats at lunar distances.  A sampling of the interests include: 	Cubesat form-factor software defined radios 	Advanced modulation and error correction schemes 	Delay tolerant networking methodologies 	Power efficiency 	Radio frequency / optical relays 	Resistance to harsh flight and space environments including heavy vibration; extreme heat and cold; and radiation hardness, tolerance, and mitigation 	Ability to integrate wireless sensors 	Autonomous control and operation 4	Specific questions: <p> Given the objectives for the RFI and the scenarios above, provide insight in the following areas. Answer the questions that relate to your companys area of expertise. It is not expected that all participants will answer all questions.  <p> 1.	What barriers do you see to establishing a community of application developers for creating applications for NASA ground and space communication systems to enable reuse of SDR applications?  a.	What platform properties are necessary to reduce the burden?  b.	What features make it easier to produce third party applications? c.	What component architectures being considered enable software and firmware reuse? d.	Any suggestions for dealing with the data rights issues inherent in software sharing? 2.	How are SDR technologies being used in the current developments of space radios? a.	Are space customers requesting in-flight reconfigurability in their radios? b.	 What are the major impediments to providing reconfigurability in space? Frequency of reconfiguration?  Mission criticality? c.	Anticipating using an SDR for a mission critical command link?	What will it take for mission developers to trust the SDR as the mission critical radio? 3.	What is the state of the art of the near-term, space applicable technologies relevant for implementing a SDR in space?  These technologies are likely to include: a.	Hardware components such as memory, ADC/DACs, FPGAs, and processors b.	Software and architectural concepts such use of multi-core processors, message passing structures, dynamic vs. static loading.   The disposition of functionality between avionics and the radios is also of interest. 4.	Assuming space customers will be expecting reconfiguration in the space environment in 20 years, what research interests are you pursuing or do you see being pursued which will enable this?  How many have you developed in the last 5 years and number projected in the next 5 years.  What type of product line that supports multiple customers requesting SDRs have you considered? 5.	Discuss the need or lack of need for real time processing. 6.	How do you address self test and automatic / self recovery and automatic reversion to known working version?  7.	Do you have any recommendations for modifications or additions to the current version of the STRS standard?  If yes, please include information on your current efforts related to STRS.  Have you implemented an STRS Operating Environment or Application? Implemented a similar architecture?  8.	What is the current state of the art in software defined radios that are capable of performing both RF (quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation; low-density parity-check (LDPC) and Turbo coding) and optical (pulse position modulation) communication?  What kind of development would be necessary to design a combined RF and optical SDR?  Would it be possible to start from an existing radio design (either RF or optical) and make additions of either RF or optical?  Would it be preferable to start over with a new radio design?  What would an ideal combined RF and optical SDR design look like? 5	Submittal Instructions: <p> 1.

The required upgrade of the electron column (H650 to H660) on the existing FEI Helios NanoLab 650 focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB SEM) system will enable true back-scatter imaging of materials with large Z differentials such as metal catalyst in polymer nanocomposites and the ability to perform high current microanalysis with max current of 100 nA.</p>
<p>Due to the proprietary nature of this system, FEI Company is the only vendor capable of providing the required Helios 660 Upgrade in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. FEI Company is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 22, 2014, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Strategic Sourcing Acquisition Division intends to award on a sole source basis with System Integration &amp; Development, Inc. using the procedures in FAR Part 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D) as well as 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), to increase the ceiling by $101,153.25 for the National Weather Service (NWS)/Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) AHWPS Web Services.   Systems Integration &amp; Development, Inc. is the only party known to NOAA who can meet these requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), which states "The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order."  The additional ceiling amount will allow for mission-critical distributed data acquisition, manipulation, and internet dissemination of NWS Water Resources datasets produced by the National Water Center (NWC) to be integrated with Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) web services.  The root cause for the request of a ceiling increase is the completion of a new National Water Center (NWC).  At the time of the execution of the current contract, the creation of a NWC and, therefore, the requirement to develop web services for it, was an unforeseen requirement for the AHPS program.  The web services for the NWC are an extension of those provided by AHPS. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541519 with a small business size standard of $25.5 million.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to john.gault@noaa.gov by August 7, 2014.

<p>The National Park Service (NPS) is seeking parties interested in operating Otter Creek Restaurant and Gift Shop or Rocky Knob Cabins along the Blue Ridge Parkway in southwestern Virginia. Individuals, governmental agencies, not-for-profit and for-profit organizations are welcome to submit proposals. All Proposals for alternative legal uses will be considered.<br /><br />The full Request for Expressions of Interest, a complete list of facilities, and additional information, is available at the link below. The facilities may be available for operation under a concession contract or a lease for varying lengths of time.</p>
<p>There will be site visits for interested parties at both locations on July 30, 2014. More information is available at: http://www.concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Otter Creek Facilities Overview </span></strong></p>
<p>The Otter Creek Restaurant, Gift Shop and Campground (MP 60.8) are located on Otter Creek, approximately 20 miles from Lynchburg, VA. The Restaurant and Gift Shop facility at Otter Creek was designed as a modern board-and-batten frame building with traditional Southern Appalachian features such as a long porch across the front, a jerkinhead or clipped gable roof, and a stone chimney. The facility opened for business in May, 1960. Site stabilization of an area just behind the restaurant was also accomplished as a part of the restaurant building improvements that occurred during the spring of 1999. A montane oak-hickory forest is the principal plant community surrounding the restaurant.</p>
<p>Historically, the 3,190 square foot facility was operated as a Restaurant and Gift Shop. The facility was open from May through October, serving breakfast and lunch. As it was configured, the dining room seated 57. The gift shop sold gifts, souvenirs, sundries and firewood. The facility has been closed since the end of 2010.</p>
<p>The adjacent, 69-site, Otter Creek campground, opened in 1960 with a small amphitheater established in 1962, is operated by the NPS, but was offered as a concession operation in the 2012 prospectus. Interested parties could improve and rent campsites, or have the opportunity to rent camping gear. Appendices to this RFEI contain additional information about the facilities.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rocky Knob Facilities Overview </span></strong></p>
<p>The Rocky Knob Cabins, a small, secluded complex of seven housekeeping cabins, a manager's house and a shower/bath house is located near Floyd, VA. These historic structures constructed in 1941 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. First developed as "trail lodges", the Cabins were remodeled for use as family housekeeping units in 1950. Six of the cabins include a bedroom and kitchen. The seventh cabin is ADA accessible and includes private bathroom in addition to a kitchen. Each cabin is 418 square feet. The 960 square foot manager's house includes a bedroom, living area, kitchen, bathroom and office. The 792 square foot shower house has men's and women's bathrooms and showers, and a laundry room. The cabins were historically available for rental May through October. The cabins have been closed since the end of 2012.</p>
<p>Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, the Blue Ridge Parkway is a 469-mile recreational motor road that connects Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks while protecting the cultural and natural features of the region. Visitors are drawn to this area to experience the stunning scenery and close-up looks at the natural and cultural history of the mountains.</p>
<p>For site visit information, questions or comments, please contact: Laura Nelson, Concessions Management Specialist, National Park Service, Blue Ridge Parkway, 199 Hemphill Knob Road, Asheville, NC 28803, email: laura_s_nelson@nps.gov, Phone: (828) 348-3407.

This RFEI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for expressions of interest does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Corporate Services Division (CSD) publishes USPTO manuals for public usage through the Internet and portable devices. USPTO Reference Document Management Services (RDMS) supports complex and highly utilized manuals that govern Patent and Trademark Examiners and public users. In February 2014, the USPTO purchased RSuite software from Really Strategies, Inc. (RSI) (d/b/a/ RSI Content Solutions), which is designed specifically for the key XML technologies that RDMS performs and is built on MarkLogic as a repository. RSuite software is utilized by RDMS to support configuration requirements.
<p>USPTO currently requires RSI professional services for the classification and manuals editing and publishing in XML to other formats that support Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC), Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP), Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (TMEP), Trademark Federal Statutes and Rules (TFSR) and Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual of Procedure (TBMP) requirements in RDMS. The contractor shall provide the USPTO with a RSuite Technical Engineer for Onsite Training and Professional services. RSuite Technical Engineer Services include 1) modification or customization of RSuite codes for editing and publishing; 2) review of the RSuite infrastructure roadmap and best practice (standby/failover) to improve the system performance; 3) support the RSuite integration of MarkLogic with USPTO's authentication scheme for patent and trademark examiners; and 4) other development issues related to RSuite, including training.</p>

In accordance with the PTAG, market research has been conducted and the USPTO has determined that that there are no resellers for this service and that only RSI is reasonably expected to be able to provide the RSuite software professional services as required by the USPTO.</p>
<p>The USPTO intends to negotiate and award a contract for RSuite technical engineer services with NAICS 541519 to REALLY STRATEGIES, INC., 2570 BOULEVARD OF THE GENERALS STE 213, AUDUBON, PA, 19403-5291 for a period of performance from date of award through April 30, 2015.

Submit offer as follows:<br />DOCUMENT CONTENTS FILE FORMAT <br />Volume One Technical Proposal PDF or .doc<br />Volume Two Past Performance PDF or .doc<br />Volume Three Pricing and Contracting PDF or .doc and .xls<br />2. Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages).

Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>ii. Volume Two -- Past Performance Information (PPI) (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). Submit information from recent contracts performed within the last three (3) years, which are considered relevant in demonstrating ability to perform local exchange services involving similar scope, magnitude of effort, and complexities as the services described in this solicitation. Include the following administrative data for each referenced contract submitted: Offeror's company name; contracting agency; contract number; brief description of contract; contract type (i.e., fixed price, time and material, etc.); period of performance, identification of any significant achievements or past problems and resolution; and name, address, telephone number, and email address of program manager and Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A.

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to award a firm-fixed price contract on a non-competitive basis with IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-On Industrial of Kenosha, WI for Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) hand tools and toolboxes in support of the US Air Force, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Japan, and FMS Israel Joint Strike Fighter F35 Tool Control Program. This procurement is for a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 8 program. Since 2011, IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-on Industrial has had a five year exclusive agreement with Lockheed Martin, the OEM for the JSF, for the JSF tools and toolboxes, and continue to work closely with the Lockheed Martin procurement and tool management personnel. IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-on Industrial independently developed and created the Design Control Activity for this program. The required tools and toolboxes have been previously designed and purchased by the JSF program at the squadron level; however, the JSF program did not procure the data to compete this requirement. Each specific tool and toolbox is designed to accomplish a specific maintenance task on the JSF aircraft. The toolboxes are fitted with foam inserts into which the exact designs of the required tools are etched. This provides the fleet with the capability of ensuring that all the tools are accounted for upon completion of the maintenance tasks. Further, training is conducted utilizing these identical tool and toolbox kits. In order to ensure that all servicemen trained on servicing the JSF aircraft and equipment can perform their designated tasks no matter where they are located, JSF tools are the same from one squadron to another. Should another manufacturer provide the tools to be procured, the requirement will then exist to re-cut the foam insert for the tool which is a costly procedure which will not be recouped through competition. Furthermore, there would then be inconsistency from one squadron to another in the type of tools utilized for each task and would present a logistics problem should replacement ever be necessary. IDSC Holdings LLC, Snap-On Industrial tools and toolboxes are essential to satisfy the agency need. IDSC Holdings LLC, Snap-On Industrial is the only source available today to meet the programs requirement.<br />The Government intends to procure the above item under the authority of 10 USC 3204 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not to request for competitive proposals: however the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government, not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of publication of this notice. The Point of Contact is Judith A. Dastis, email: judith.dastis@navy.mil, (732) 323-7339.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE</p>
<p><br />SHORT TITLE: Humble Island Temporary Tower</p>
<p>1. PLACE(S) OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>a. Humble Island, TX</p>
<p>2.0 BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>33 CFR 161 requires traffic in the Port Arthur, TX area comply with specific regulations. Cargo in this area may be designated as Certain Dangerous Cargo (CDC) such as explosives, blasting agents, poisonous gas in excess of one metric ton per vessel and poisonous material in excess of 20 metric tons per vessel, certain oxidizing materials, radioactive and fusible material, bulk liquefied chlorine and bulk liquefied gas that is toxic and/or flammable. (33 CFR 160.204). An incident involving these materials could have long term and deadly consequences and should be avoided.</p>
<p>The CG erected a Tower at the intersection of the Neches River and the Sabine River. Camera and radar were mounted to collect data to be used to manage the area and prevent incidents. This coverage is nearly one third of the VTS Port Arthur area of responsibility.</p>
<p>Monitoring of this site revealed the land was being eroded and the Tower was at risk of falling into the water. The original estimate was early 2014. The current estimate is summer/July 2014. A causality response (CASREP) was created to report the situation. An alternate site has been located, but will not be available until late 2016.</p>
<p>The loss of camera and radar data between 2014 and 2016 will severely degrade the capabilities and negatively affect operations. To mitigate this risk, a temporary solution is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.0 Overall Objectives:<br />The CG is seeking to Contract with a Contractor who will provide the Services of Designing, Installing and Maintaining and then Removing of a Temporary Tower at Humble Island TX at Lat/Long Location: 29.972136, -93.853007. <br />The Temporary Tower and all associated materials, hardware, will remain the Property of the Contractor. <br />The CG will mount Camera, Radar and associated Cabling to the tower and move a Hut near the base for additional equipment. When the Temporary Tower is no longer needed, the Contractor shall remove the Tower from the site and do any required land restoration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />4.0 Requirements:</p>
<p>4.1 Design Tower Structure <br />The site is located in a hurricane prone area. The Temporary Tower Structure will need to be Engineered to withstand 150 mph winds with a CG Radar not to exceed 2500 pounds mounted at the total height of 70 feet above ground level. The Contractor shall coordinate with the USCG for fabricating the top most level's decking to accept the CG Radar. Additionally, during winds of less than 30 mph, the tower shall support the additional weight of 4 support personnel of approximately 150 pounds each. The Tower shall be able to withstand mounting one Camera and all associated data cabling not to exceed 250 lbs on any vertical upright at approximately 60 to 65 feet.</p>
<p>4.1.1 Cattle graze on this site. The Contractor shall provide guards and common cattle fencing to keep the cattle from adjusting the position of the Tower or any Guy Wire Supports. Guards are to be designed as to not injure the Cattle.</p>
<p>4.1.2 The Proposed Design of the Temporary Tower is to be certifiable and then after award Approved by a Professional Engineer(PE). The Proposed Design Drawings are to be provided in the Contractors Proposal.</p>
<p>4.1.3 The Contractor shall identify information they need to customize their tower to allow the CG equipment to be mounted.</p>
<p>4.1.4 Periodically the CG will need to access the Radar and Camera equipment. The design shall allow an access mechanism such as an enclosed ladder, and working platform with fall protection anchors. All mechanisms shall comply with OSHA regulations. If any specialized equipment or procedures are required, they shall be identified to the USCG. For example, if tower climbing gear will be required, any specific features about the gear shall be identified.</p>
<p><br />4.1.5 Tower shall be grounded. Contractor provided grounding shall include the mechanisms for the CG to ground the CG provided radar and camera devices.</p>
<p>4.1.6 The CG will move a 4 ft x 8 ft equipment shelter (aka Hut) adjacent to the base of the Tower. Commercial power lines and communication lines will be rerouted to connect to the Hut. The Radar and Camera feeds from the Tower will connect to the Hut. The design shall provide for the hut, power lines and communication lines.</p>
<p>4.2 Erect Tower Structure</p>

Performance Work Statement
Participation in Disciplinary Alerts Service
Federation of State Medical Boards

Background: The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) of the United States was founded in 1912.  The Federation's membership comprises the medical boards of all the states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and 13 state boards of osteopathic medicine.  

FSMB also operates the Federation Physician Data Center, a nationally recognized system for collecting, recording and distributing to state medical boards and other appropriate agencies data on disciplinary actions taken against licensees by the boards and other governmental authorities.  The role of State licensing boards is to protect the public.  Over 80% of all actions taken by State licensing boards are prejudicial to the physician and taken for violations such as quality of care, sexual misconduct, insurance fraud, alcohol/ substance abuse or inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances.  The Department of Defense makes similar information available to the Federation concerning physicians in the military. The Department of Health and Human Services reports data relating to Medicare/Medicaid sanctions.  
	
Considered the preeminent resource for board action information, the FSMB Physician Data Center is the only central repository for formal actions taken against physicians by state licensing and disciplinary boards, Canadian licensing authorities, the U.S. armed forces, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and other regulatory bodies.

The Federation Physician Data Center contains more than 267,000 board actions related to approximately 68,336 physicians dating to the 1960s. This information is available to licensing and disciplinary boards, the military, governmental and private agencies and organizations involved in the employment and/or credentialing of physicians.

To be included in the Data Center, an action must be a matter of public record or be legally releasable to state medical boards or other entities with recognized authority to review physician credentials. Actions fall into two categories: prejudicial (e.g., revocations, probations, suspensions or consent orders) and non-prejudicial (e.g., reinstatements of licensure, replacement of lost or destroyed licenses or license denials). Once reported to the Federation, an action becomes part of the physician's permanent record.

SCOPE of WORK

The Government's requirement is to subscribe to the ability to submit identifying information on physicians (MDs and DOs) to the FSMB's Board Action Data Bank.  FSMB will provide services consisting of the screening of individual physicians as requested by the Government, by means of a search of its Board Action Data Bank (BADB) in order to provide to the Government information in the furtherance of the Government's exercise of its responsibilities to establish the credentials of physicians pursuant to its lawful functions.  The FSMB will report to the Government, all licenses current or previously held that are known to the FSMB as well as any orders reported to the FSMB from licensing entities, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS OIG) and the Department of Defense, will be cross referenced against the VHA's identifying data table.  Subsequent to the initial screening, in the event a disciplinary action is reported to the FSMB on one of the providers previously screened with an appointment to a VA medical center, the VHA Credentialing and Privileging Program Director is notified via e-mail that an action has been reported.  The disciplinary information that pertains to the physician can then be downloaded for review and inclusion in the physician's credentials file.  All information provided to the FSMB in accordance with this agreement will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Privacy Act System of Records Notice, 77VA10Q, Health Care Provider Credentialing and Privileging Records - VA.  

SPECIFIC MANDATORY TASKS AND ASSOCIATED DELIVERABLES

Task 1:  The FSMB shall provide VA with an account and data tables in which VA will enroll VA physicians through the import of specified physician information described elsewhere in this Statement of Work so that such data can be used to search against the BADB for any orders reported to the FSMB from licensing entities.  

Task 2:  Upon receipt of a report of a new order being reported to the FSMB on a VA physician enrolled in the BADB from a reporting entity, the FSMB shall notify VA via e-mail of the presence of the new order which VA staff shall be able to access and obtain a hard-copy of such order.  

Task 3.a:  FSMB shall provide VA with a copy of the enrollment data from the BADB for VA to update, adding practitioners who are new to the VA credentialing process and deleting those for whom monitoring by VA is no longer necessary.  

Task 3.b:  FSMB shall incorporate the VA updated data, submitted by VA to FSMB, into the BADB.

Task 4:  To assure quality communication with FSMB leadership and its member boards, registration to the FSMB Annual Meeting shall be provided to two (2) VA participants.

The Government agrees that its use of information from the BADB will consist of reporting to its VA medical facilities the results of BADB searches.  The Government agrees to keep all information provided by the FSMB in strictest confidence and warrants that it will not release, or allow to be released, any information of any sort whatever, either directly or indirectly, or in any other manner, to any person, party, entity, or organizations except to its VA medical facilities.  

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

BUSINESS PURPOSES. 

The Government agrees that all requests for searches of the BADB will be limited to physicians about whom the Government requires such information in fulfillment of its responsibilities pursuant to its lawful functions.  It is understood and agreed by the parties that the Government acts on behalf of various healthcare organizations (VA medical facilities) whose legitimate business purpose requires verification of the board action history of individual physicians, and the Government warrants that all of its VA medical facilities are health care organizations having a legitimate business purpose that includes verification of such board action history records.  The Government agrees that it will not use BADB information nor compile the information for use by or sale to any person or entity other than as specified herein.

PHYSICIAN INFORMATION.  

The Government agrees to submit data for BADB search purposes in the format specified by FSMB for the search methodology to be used by The Government.  The required biographic information for the individuals to be searched will consist of the following:

		ii)	Date of birth
iii)	Medical school attended
		iv)	Year of graduation from medical school
		v)	Social Security number - if available
		vi)	National Provider Identifier (NPI)

It is understood and acknowledged by The Government that failure to submit complete biographic information on individuals to be searched will result in rejection of the search request as incomplete.  Any such rejected request must be resubmitted with the complete biographic data, and will be subject to fees as a new search.

Data is transmitted via secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP).  Data transmission is in accordance with the Privacy Act System of Records Notice, 77VA10Q - Health Care Provider Credentialing and Privileging Records-VA, Routine Use 5, which allows for the release of such information to the FSMB "in order for the Department to obtain information relevant to a Department decision concerning the hiring, utilization, appointment, retention or termination of individuals covered by this system or to inform a Federal agency or licensing boards or the appropriate non-government entities about the health care practices of a currently employed, appointed, otherwise utilized, terminated, resigned, or retired health care employee or other individuals covered by this system whose professional health care activity so significantly failed to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice as to raise reasonable concern for the safety of patients. These records may also be disclosed as part of an ongoing computer-matching program to accomplish these purposes."

DATA RIGHTS

The Government agrees that searches of the BADB will be only on physicians for whom The Government has an authorization, duly executed by the physician, on file.  

RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAMAGES.

Each Party shall be responsible for any and all damages, claims, liabilities, or judgments from third parties, which may arise as a result of its own negligence or actions.

       	  Strategic Acquisition Center
             10300 Spotsylvania Avenue, Ste 400
	   Fredericksburg, VA 22408
      		
2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 we seek to use other than full and open market competition procedures to issue a sole source, firm fixed price (FFP) contract to the incumbent contractor to provide monitoring and licensing and verification services on physicians practicing within the VHA on a nationwide basis. Federation State Medical Board (FSMB), 400 Fuller Wiser Rd Suite 300, Euless, TX 76039, is the only company that is quick and accurate and fulfills the VHA's unique need of providing continuous monitoring, licensing and verification of its network of Physicians.     

3.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

4.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) was founded in 1912. The FSMB comprises the medical boards of all 52 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and 13 state boards of osteopathic medicine. This vast network gives the FSMB unlimited access to physicians who are license to practice medicine in each. The FSMB operates the Physician Data Center which is a nationally recognized system for recording, collecting and distributing to state medical boards and other governmental authorities data on disciplinary actions taken against license physicians. VHA is responsible for assuring that all physicians who practice medicine in VA facilities are authorized to do so. One authorization must be from one or more State licensing boards.  Additionally, in accordance with Title 38 U.S.C. 7402(f), physicians may not practice in VA facilities if a single license has been terminated for cause or surrendered after written notification of potential for termination until such license is fully reinstated. VHA medical staff works diligently in their monitoring of physician licenses however the administrative effort required for this type of monitoring is not without error. Furthermore the time it takes to get background verification completed from state to state vary by weeks. The normal verification procedure requires the VHA Credentialing authority to validate licenses by contacting the state licensing board for each physician and initiate a background investigation. This process verifies all current and previously held licenses have no disciplinary actions. Since state boards are reluctant to share information with each other and outside agencies the process is slow. This delay causes interruption to the critical care our Nation's Veterans so desperately need. 

Through the services offered by the FSMB, VHA will learn of disciplinary actions in an expeditious manner. After researching methods for VHA to automatically be notified in the event of a pending or final action against one of the 60,000 physicians delivering care to our veterans, our market research has determined that there are no other sources.  The Federation of State Medical Boards provides a Disciplinary Alerts Service which is unique in that they get immediate responses to inquiries though their access to a real time database thus making it the only one of its kind. The accuracy and immediacy of this information is crucial to providing assurance that our veterans are receiving the best possible care.

Additionally, the Federation of State Medical Board will create a database from which the accounts of enrolled VA Physicians will be crossed referenced and screened against a databank of medical board actions to verify any disciplinary reports. The contractor shall report to the government any licenses currently or previously held that are known to the contractor to have disciplinary information.  Additionally, orders reported to the Department of Health and Human Services office of inspector General, the Department of Defense or licensing entities such as the American Medical Association will be provided to the VHA Credentialing and Privileging Program Director. The contractor shall provide the VHA Credentialing Program director new reports on physicians that are enrolled in the database. This report shall be preceded by an email notice to the director. The contractor shall provide a copy of the enrollment data from their database to the VHA for updating and deletions by the VA credentialing authority. The total estimated value of this proposed action is $486,000 (inclusive of options). 


5. Efforts to Obtain Competition: VA Market research was conducted, details of which are in paragraph 7, the market research section of this document. A Request for Information (RFI) was posted to the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition. Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR 5.201.  Any proposals that are received shall be evaluated. 

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A Notice shall be publicized and synopsized under requirements stated in FAR Part 5. This agency will work directly with the program office to perform market research in the hopes of finding alternate solutions.

7. Market Research Results: Request for Information (RFI) was issued on April 17, 2014 via the FBO to ascertain if there were any other sources that could meet the Government's requirements.  No responses were received from any source. The VetBiz.gov database was also queried with negative results. Additionally, GSA E-library was queried for possible source with no results. Given these findings the contracting specialist concluded that the FSMB is currently the only source can provide the required services. This conclusion supports the findings of the VHA's Program Management Office.

8. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: The fact that this requirement calls for immediate and accurate response to inquiries is a crucial factor in the determination that this service is only available from one source. 

9. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  

10. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed. Specifically, this agency will work directly with the program office to perform market research prior to the exercise of the next option year to determine if market conditions have changed enough to make this a competitive requirement. 

11. Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

12. Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated contracting action will represent the best value to the Government consistent with FAR 12.601. Additionally, price analysis of historical prices quoted covering similar services and parametric estimating will be used to determine price reasonableness.

<DESC>Paragraph 2 of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation notice posted on 3 July 2014 for FA8075-14-R-0001 (AFICA Cyber Security Technical Area Task (CS TAT)) is hereby changed to read:
<p><br /><br />The Government intends to make multiple awards under this solicitation using both an unrestricted Full and Open (F&amp;O) competition pool and a partial Small Business (SB) set-aside competition pool for all TATs estimated at $3.5M and below. For the F&amp;O competition pool the Government seeks to award a target number of six IDIQ contracts. For the SB competition pool the Government seeks to award a target number of three SB IDIQ contracts. The Government reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts in total or in a different mix of SB and F&amp;O awards if the Source Selection Authority (SSA) determines it is in the Government's best interest. The SSA will consider the Government's expected volume of work, available funding, adequate competition, and the availability of best-value proposals. Each contract will have a total five year ordering period, constructed of a base and option periods. The CS TATs acquisition (IDIQ contract(s)) will be conducted using a Limited Tradeoff source selection process to make a best value assessment where trade-off(s) for the competition pools for the unrestricted Full and Open (F&amp;O) and partial Small Business (SB) set-aside with a $3.5M threshold, are permitted between technical subfactors 1a (unrestricted F&amp;O) or 1b (partial SB set-aside), past performance and cost/price factors if the superior performance warrants the price differential and is considered to provide the best value to the Government (Technical and Past Performance combined, are significantly more important than price). Technical and past performance will be evaluated separately based on the competition pool. Pricing criteria will be evaluated identical for all business types (large and small).</p>

<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: Offers will be evaluated IAW FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process. It is the intent of the Government to issue a single award which will be made to the Offeror who is deemed responsible and responsive, that reflects a complete understanding of the specifications and drawings in the Request for Quotation and is judged to represent the best value to the U.S. Government based on selection of the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price. The U.S. Government reserves the right to refrain from awarding to any contractor in the event that all Offerors progressing beyond the technically acceptable evaluation are determined to have offered pricing that is not considered realistic, reasonable, or complete. To arrive at a decision, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) will integrate the source selection team's evaluations of the factors and subfactors described in the paragraphs that follow. These factors are the uniform baseline against which each Offeror's quotation is compared to determine the confidence the U.S. Government has that the Offeror will be able to satisfactorily accomplish all work required. They establish the level an Offeror's quotation must meet in any area, factor, or element in order to be judged acceptable. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and include all information required.<br />A. Evaluation Process:</p>
<p>1. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price.</p>
<p>2. The three lowest priced Offerors' technical quotation will then be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation approach described below in paragraph B.2.</p>
<p>3. If none of the three lowest priced Offerors is deemed technically acceptable, the next lowest priced Offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an Offeror is judged to have a technically acceptable assessment or until all Offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision if the lowest priced Offeror is not judged to be technically acceptable.</p>
<p>4. Prior to award, a responsibility determination will be made as described in FAR Part 9.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>1. PRICE: For award purposes, the Government will evaluate the total price in the Schedule (Attachment #2 Schedule &amp; Acknowledgement). The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced, which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of the item or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable. Proposed prices will become fixed prices on the contract.</p>
<p>a. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, Offeror's may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.</p>
<p>2. EVALUATING TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>a. Technical quotation will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.</p>
<p>b. To meet the minimum level of acceptability, a technical quotation shall include the following items:</p>
<p>A. A Demolition Plan, with proposed schedule, and a Hazardous Material/Abatement Plan.</p>
<p>B. The Demolition Plan shall discuss/give details on the following:</p>
<p>1) Site preparation <br />(2) Building demolition <br />(3) Asphalt/Walkway demolition <br />(4) Foundation removal<br />(5) Utility demolition and removal <br />(6) Site Restoration</p>
<p><br />C. The Hazardous Material/Abatement Plan shall discuss/give details on the following:</p>
<p>(1) Handling and disposal of hazardous material. <br />(2) Restoration/Remediation of contaminated areas.</p>
<p>c. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable , the Offeror will be excluded from competition.</p>
<p>d. The Technical Evaluation Team will rate the technical submissions according to the chart listed:</p>
<p>RATING DEFINITION <br />Acceptable Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation <br />Unacceptable Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />C. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a technical rating of other than acceptable. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>D. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Addenda To 52.212-1. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quotation. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for quotation revision.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective Offeror's. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

In the PWS the contractor shall describe the technical approach necessary to achieve the Government's performance objectives identified herein.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Variation in clinical practice is known to lead to significant difference in the cost of medical care. As indicated in the literature, using validated data at the individual provider and service level, variation will be reduced or eliminated over time to dramatically reduce costs and improve the experience of care for the patient. The Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) does not possess a well-defined mechanism to identify and quantify clinical variation and is seeking a solution from an outside source.</p>
<p>The offeror is encouraged to present innovative recommendations and approaches in their proposal as well as detailed costs involved.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Objectively improve the major metrics of inpatient quality and save significant costs by reducing clinical and operational variations at the individual provider (e.g., physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, independent duty corpsman, etc.), clinical service, and hospital levels.<br />2. Data analysis:<br />a. Work with the NMCSD Information Management and TRICARE Operations Departments to access and analyze the available clinical and resource consumption data. Data analysis will be performed on the NMCSD campus only. No remote access to military health system data is available. The contractor may also use publically available data for their analysis.<br />b. Use risk-adjusted methodology to assess multiple years of patient-level data to identify clinical variations of individual providers and clinical services.<br />3. Based on the data and Command's recommendation, select two services to participate in a pilot to identify drivers of clinical variation and produce the highest quality, most cost efficient outcomes.<br />4. Provide individual providers with actionable information to target cases with most effective and efficient outcomes to replicate best practices: <br />a. Provide each provider with objective, risk-adjusted data that demonstrates their resource consumption variation for each of the functional service groups (lab, pharmacy, etc.).<br />b. Provide each provider with resource consumption variations data for comparing performance and variation reduction with their peers.<br />c. Provide each provider and each clinical service with data for highest quality and most cost efficient resource consumption by clinical cohort (DRGs) for to develop or modify clinical practice guidelines based on patient acuity level.<br />d. Information provided will be in the form of charts and tables that display data including but not limited to costs associated to episodes of care grouped by primary diagnosis, orders (type and frequently) placed during each episode of care, length of stay, charges vs. length of stay comparison, individual variation reduction, service variation reduction, etc.<br />e. Provide clinical and operational data in an educational, non-threatening format to providers and hospital personnel.<br />5. Assess providers' diagnostic documentation and medical record ICD coding accuracies.<br />6. As providers begin to modify their practices, assess hospital operations and make recommendations for improvements where appropriate.<br />7. Develop a dashboard for providers to facilitate tracking optimal outcomes over time to secure and improve upon quality gains and cost reductions. The dashboard will provide real time data on improvements in clinical indicators by provider and by service to maintain a focus on continuous best practice improvements. The dashboard data should include but not be limited to physician (as a code, not name), ED decision to admit in hours, time from presentation in ED to procedure, critical care management, non-related procedures, promptness of consults, no orders or changes in 48 hours, chronic disease management, readmits, etc.<br />8. Work with the quality and productivity staff to enhance reporting and educational formats and hand off these data and educational functions for future implementations as appropriate.<br />9. Prepare and present a plan to extend clinical variation reductions across additional services and a plan to roll out clinical variation services to additional hospitals within the Region.<br />10. From date of award contractor will be able to complete the objectives within 12 weeks. The contractor may propose a shorter schedule that will be evaluated.</p>
<p>11. Written summary report: Provide written reports of data collected, results, actions taken, and recommendations along with bi-weekly status reports.</p>
<p>12. Contractor will provide onsite review of the program for suggestions and adjustments as needed to ensure success six months and one year from the date of award.</p>
<p>13. Contractor will remain available for telephonic consultation for one year from the date of the award.</p>
<p>14. Software/computer hardware: If the contractor solution includes software or computer that will be installed on Government owned computer assets:</p>
<p>a. Software and hardware must be DON Application and Database Management System (DADMS) approved. Systems that are not DADMS approved must be standalone and not tied to the NMCSD network.<br />b.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The boundaries are generally located along recognizable topographic (for example, ridgelines) or vegetation (for example, transition from shrub field to timber stand) features. The contractor will be expected to be aware of the approximate unit boundaries within which to conduct the required work. However, the Contractor will not be required to physically mark (for example, with flagging), the unit boundaries. The attached Detail Unit Maps and Aerial Maps show the location of each unit. Contractors will be provided additional large scale maps to assist in location of unit boundaries on the ground. The size (acres) of each unit has been determined using GIS mapping.</p>
<p>The Detailed Unit Information Chart indicates the percentage of each unit to be cut, based on aerial photograph interpretation. The contractor is only expected to cut shrubs on the percentage of each unit indicated. For example, Unit 6 contains 85 acres, and 90% of the area is estimated to contain shrubs to be cut; therefore, the Contractor would be required to cut shrubs on approximately 76 acres within the unit.</p>
<p>Project Access</p>
<p>Access to the general project area consists of high standard paved and gravel surface Forest roads that are passable by a standard two-wheel-drive pickup truck equipped for mountain driving during the normal operating season (approximately April 1 to November 1). Access may be seasonally limited (by snow) outside of the normal operating season.</p>
<p>Motorized Equipment. Use of motorized equipment other than hand-held implements such as power saws or brush cutters by the Contractor will not be permitted off designated roads and trails without approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>Questions &amp; Answers 7/7/14<br /><br />1) Please provide me with the motherboard manufacturer and chipset as well as the processor you are attempting to replace with the system you are buying.
<p>&gt;&gt; Existing motherboard to be replaced is DFI PT630-NRM using the Intel Q57 chipset. Processor was Intel i5-680. System doesn't need to be exactly the same since some of those parts are End-of-Life, but it needs to be hardware compatible (swap drive from one PC to another). We've tested that successfully with the ASUS P8H77-V LE motherboard so it shouldn't be too hard BUT THIS ASUS BOARD ISN'T SATISFACTORY DUE TO LACK OF DUAL LAN.</p>
<p>2) Are the computers to be assembled or is it just parts?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Assembled and tested that everything is recognized within the BIOS.</p>
<p>3) So would it be acceptable to quote a system with the Jetway JNAF93-Q77 system board?<br /><br />&gt;&gt; Yes, that would be completely acceptable.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS: FA5004-14-B-0003</p>
<p>Eielson AFB, Alaska has a requirement for Sludge Removal.</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide all equipment, personnel, labor, and materials needed to suction sludge and use of sludge press, geo-bags, or other method to obtain solids with no free liquid content as determined by the "Paint Filter Liquids Test". The Contractor shall also provide all equipment, personnel, labor, and materials needed to, load, transport and dispose of the sediment into Eielson's permitted land fill in the Quarry Hills area. The Contractor shall perform this work according to the following performance standards in the Performance Work Statement. The Eielson AFB Water Treatment Plant uses six manganese oxide coated pressurized sand filters to remove the iron and manganese out of the water. When the filters are backwashed, the backwash water is sent to a settling pond where the suspended matter settles out of the water. Over the years of backwashing the filters, there has been an accumulation of sediment in the settling pond which has reduced the depth to about half the capacity. The dimension of the pond is roughly 210 feet by 68 feet by 5 feet and has a capacity of approximately 306,000 gallons of water. The estimated amount of sediment accumulation is approximately two to three feet in the bottom of the settling pond, approximately 188,500 gallons, 800 cu. yards. The sediment is high in water content and must be de-watered to meet the requirement for no free liquids as determined by the "Paint Filter Liquids Test". The personnel at the Water Treatment Plant will collect a composite sample of the sediment and have it tested in accordance with the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, test method 1311 as mentioned in 40 CFR 261.24 to ensure that the sediment is within the parameters for disposal. The invitation for bid will be made available for download at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 15 days.</p>
<p>This action is set aside for Total Small Business in accordance with FAR 19.502-2, Total Small Business Set-Asides. The applicable North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, with a small business size standard of $19 Million. This contract will be Firm-Fixed Price (FFP).</p>
<p>This Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued electronically. It will be available only via the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fedbizopps.gov). Potential bidders are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package, and amendments, as no paper copies will be furnished. A bidder mailing list will not be maintained. Potential bidders should register at www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the IFB.</p>
<p>Interested contractors are encouraged to submit their contact information by registering as an interested vendor utilizing the Vendor Notification Service link within the Register to Receive Notification function. All bidders MUST be registered in the System of Award Management (SAM) database at http://www.sam.gov. Bidders may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.fsd.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor NGS under contract number HHSM-500-2013-M0015Z in the amount of $665,556 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS. <br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.
<p>The work to be performed is aligned within the core scope of duties; however, the contractor is being directed to perform additional work. MACs shall enter data into the HITECH Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12 month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted, MACs shall update the data in FISS within five business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet arrested and received their initial payment). In addition, MACs shall review and determine an allowable amount for critical access hospital incentive payments, once submitted by the hospital. MACs shall complete its review and enter the allowable amount in FISS within 30 days of receipt of the documentation.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

6.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY: FAR 13.106-l(b) states that contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source to be reasonably available.


1 I determine only one source to be reasonably available based one of the following circumstances:


 1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.    0   Unusual and compelling urgency.
 0  Authorized or required by statute (38 USC 8123)

If approved, the JUSTIFICATION MUST be posted to FBO for all procurements above $25k.

7.	Provide a brief statement explaining your determination why the nature of the goods or service to be purchased is relatively noncompetitive and the urgency of the proposed purchase.
6 KL-25 Tablet/Capsule counters for the Memphis Pharmacy.  Limited market research revealed that similar counters are available on the open market and under GSA/VA FSS Contracts; However the KL25 Tablet-Capsule counter is the preferred product and has salient characteristics (speed-accuracy-inventory-dispenser etc...) not found in other KUOMIGSAIFSS models. In addition, the Memphis VA currently has a Maintenance Support contract in place with BIOMED which services the KL Models. Kirby Lester is in the process of adding the KL-25 to their VA NAC contract (V797P4241B) and the vendor has offered the units at FSS pricing (-11,040.00) and waived the 690.00 shipping charge. KL is a small business and FSS Prime Vendor schedule holder.
8. Dollar Value of proposed purchase and past experience concerning vendor's prices.
Procurement of 6 KL-25 Tablet/Capsule counters for the Memphis Pharmacy.  The total value of this procurement is $41,730. Kirby Lester is in the process of adding the KL-25 to their VA NAC contract (V797P4241B) and the vendor has offered the units at FSS pricing (-11,040.00) and waived the 690.00 shipping charge. KL is a small business and FSS Prime Vendor schedule holder.
Past PO's 614-A9912 $114220.00 6995.00/unit + 115.00/unit shipping.
9. CERTIFICATION AND SIGNATURE APPROVALS: Pursuant to FAR 1.707 Signature Authority, this Justification has been thoroughly reviewed and recommends approval.  I certify that the above facts and representations under my cognizance that are included in this Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
