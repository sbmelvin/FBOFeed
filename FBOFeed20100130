<p><strong><br />PROCUREMENT OBJECTIVE<br /><br /></strong>The objective of this Task Order is to establish Tissue Source Sites (TSS) to provide human tissues for biomedical research, one of the two main initiatives for the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), a pilot project of the NIH Roadmap. This effort will be organized within the National Cancer Institute's (NCI cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) to whom the samples will be shipped for quality evaluation and use by the Laboratory component of GTEx.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW OF THE GTEX PROJECT</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Purpose of the GTEx Project</span></p>
<p>The GTEx project, a NIH Roadmap Initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. By treating global RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, loci with polymorphisms that are highly correlated with variations in expression will be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs. The SNPs within the eQTL that are correlated with gene expression are sometimes called eSNPs. Based on analysis of individual tissues, 4% or more of gene transcripts have cis-eQTLs, operationally defined as an eSNP that is located close to the gene whose expression it is correlated with. To identify trans-eQTLs, in which the eSNP maps far from the gene or on a different chromosome from the gene it is regulating, much larger numbers of samples relative to cis-eQTLs, will be required to achieve a statistically significant association. This is due to the need to adjust for the large number of statistical tests involved in searching for correlation between expression levels of every transcript and a very large number of genetic variants. Comprehensive identification of both cis- and trans-eQTLs will provide a valuable basis on which to study gene regulation with an immediate application in interpreting GWAS study findings.</p>
<p><br />The GTEx project will begin with a 2.5-year, 3-phased pilot in FY10. As developed at a June 2008 GTEx Workshop (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/workshop0608), the primary goal of the overall pilot is to assess the feasibility of enrolling 160 deceased donors identified through low post-mortem-interval (PMI) autopsy or organ/tissue transplant settings and collecting high-quality RNA from multiple tissues per donor. The precise number of tissues that yield high-quality RNA that can be collected from each donor is not known. The aim of this project is to collect as many different tissue types as is practical, ideally between 50 to 70, and to analyze gene expression in at least 50 tissues per donor.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>PROCUREMENT OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>This Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is being solicited to identify a pool of qualified candidates for BOA award to facilitate contracting for future work in support of both The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). It is intended that multiple BOA awards will be made so that future Task Orders may be competed among the pool of qualified BOA holders.</p>
<p><strong>Offerors responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP) are also encouraged to respond to RFP No. S10-120 for Biospecimen Acquisition and Quality Assessment Operations in Support of GTEx that is also currently posted to </strong><a href="http://www.fbo.gov"><strong>www.fbo.gov</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp; RFP No. S10-120 represents the first Task Order issued under the umbrella of this BOA.<br /><br />RFP No. S10-120&nbsp;may be found at URL: </strong><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=468505e53f516bf50e18581a7f139d43&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0"><strong>https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=468505e53f516bf50e18581a7f139d43&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0</strong></a><strong>. <br /></strong><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute is expanding funding of basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on the sufficient availability of high quality biospecimens and associated data suitable for use in its research programs.</p>
<p>The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB, http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/cahub/) is a targeted effort to establish a centralized, world class cancer tissue resource, Pathology Resource Center, and associated infrastructure. caHUB has a mission to accelerate biomedical and translational cancer research by ensuring the adequate and continuous supply of high-quality, highly annotated human biospecimens. caHUB will create a collection of diseased and normal biospecimens to support a broad range of scientific needs. caHUB will support collaborative research combining the power of multiple analytical platforms and technologies across the same set of highly qualified and characterized biospecimens. With caHUB and the research and development that caHUB will support, the NCI's overarching goal is to improve the ability to diagnose, prognosticate, treat, develop new and novel therapeutics, and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Normal human tissues are essential to the study of cancer and other diseases. The National Institutes of Health's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a NIH Roadmap initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. caHUB will acquire normal tissues for the GTEx project through contracts with organizations such as rapid autopsy programs, organ and tissue transplant programs, surgical tissue procurement programs, and medical examiner programs.</p>
<p>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is to solicit technical capabilities responses from entities that have the ability to serve as a Tissue Source Site (TSS), providing clinically annotated normal human biospecimens to caHUB and GTEx.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>To meet caHUB and GTEx project goals, SAIC-F will award one or more Basic Ordering Agreements to organizations capable of accruing and delivering targeted normal biospecimens and their associated clinical data. The biospecimens and data will be delivered to caHUB for quality control, extensive pathology characterization, diagnostic verification, processing into molecular analytes, storage, other relevant processes, and distribution for qualified research and development.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that organizations providing technical capabilities proposals in response to this solicitation may include, among others:<br /><br />&bull; Dedicated Rapid Autopsy Programs<br />&bull; Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs)<br />&bull; Tissue Recovery Organizations (TROs)<br />&bull; Medical Examiners<br />&bull; Surgical Tissue Procurement Programs</p>
