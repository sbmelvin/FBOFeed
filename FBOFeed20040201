<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to generate an air emissions inventory and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from parties interested in proposing on this requirement.   The Title of this study is "Year 2005 Gulfwide Emission Inventory Study".  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursable-type contract for service. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  The study would generate a 2005 air emissions inventory of criteria pollutants- carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter-10 (PM10), particulate matter-2.5 (PM2.5), all VOC including exempted compounds (40CFR51.100), as well as greenhouse gases- carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20), for all sources in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  These emissions data are needed to support ozone and regional haze modeling efforts promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their more stringent ambient air quality standards for ozone and new regulations for regional haze.  Specific objectives of this study are to provide support services and to recommend any modifications of the Gulfwide Offshore Activities Data System- Version 1 (GOADS-1) and the Database Management Software- Version 1 (DBMS-1), to collect, describe, quality control, and archive 2005 activity data from platform and non-platform sources on the OCS, and to calculate and archive emissions data for calendar year 2005.  Activity data from all equipment sources must be collected from all major platforms on the OCS using GOADS-1.  Surveys will have to be performed to gather activity data from non-platform sources, such as support vessels and helicopters.  In addition, estimates shall be made of emissions from commercial shipping, tanker lightering, commercial fisheries, geogenic/biogenic sources, and other emission sources on the OCS.  By using DBMS-1 software, the 2005 activity data and appropriate emissions factors are multiplied to obtain total emissions.  Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality of the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, oil production platform equipment, non-platform air emissions sources on the OCS, conducting air emissions inventories, and EPA regulations and submittal procedures.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge of Visual Basic, Windows and Oracle are needed to support the existing software used to gather platform activity data (GOADS-1) and calculate the total emissions (DBMS-1).  This knowledge should include programming to revise the existing software if necessary, plus understanding the programming languages and software to perform the necessary actions to calculate the high quality emission inventory.  A description of an on-going emission inventory study sponsored by MMS can be found on the following web page:  "Gulfwide Emissions Inventory Study for the Regional Haze and Ozone Modeling Efforts" (GM-99-08) at http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/ongoing_studies/gom-as.html.
