<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education's, 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program is a State formula-grant program authorized under Title IV, Part B, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.  The No Child Left Behind Act converted the 21st CCLC program from discretionary grants, administered directly by Department of Education, to a program in which each State receives an allotment under a formula based on their share of Title I, Part A funds.  States must use their allocations to make competitive awards to eligible entities.  Grants made under the antecedent program will continue to be managed at the Federal level until they expire.  The Secretary may reserve up to one percent of the total appropriation for the 21st CCLC program to carry out an array of national activities, including but not limited to national evaluations and the technical assistance.

The objective of the 21st CCLC program is to enable community learning centers to have the ability to plan, implement, or expand after-school learning enrichment opportunities to help students meet State and local standards in core content areas.  21st CCLC programs must primarily serve children who attend schools identified with high-poverty, while also giving priority to serving children in low-performing schools based on State standards.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) intends to establish a contract inclusive of a base period with two option periods that will be used to provide continued technical assistance through a professional development module to help State and local programs throughout the country design and implement research-based, effective afterschool learning opportunities for children primarily in high-poverty, low-performing schools.  Under this procurement, the contractor shall design professional development databases and modules using a hybrid of distance learning techniques, train the trainer techniques, and regional study circles to increase the capacity of local 21st CCLC project and program directors to use nationally recognized best practices to improve the academic outcomes of their participating students.  These databases and modules will focus on equipping afterschool program staff with the knowledge and background in program and activity design best practices so that program staffs may create curricula and activities that use local academic outcomes and objectives to design hands-on, experiential, and participatory activities that are different from the methodology used to deliver the same content during the school day.  All features would be housed on a web-based portal on the website of the contractor that can easily be transported to a new platform at the end of the contract period.

Several aspects of this contract require strong collaboration and coordination among distinct entities involved in the model identification and dissemination process.  Additionally, the contractor must have access to and be knowledgeable of the information and materials pertaining to after-school programs to ensure that it has the capabilities to be thoroughly familiar with existing literature on effective afterschool content-area curriculum, specifically in the areas of reading, mathematics, and science and professional development.  The main deliverable of this contract will be an interactive web portal encompassing several distinct sections.  This portal will provide:

•A technology-based, user-centric, one-stop infrastructure that includes a virtual gateway for State coordinators and sub-grantees to select academic and learning strategies, classroom instructional materials, staff and instructional training modules, best business practices, and program evaluation tools;
•Evaluation strategies and tools that will eliminate duplication, and enhance quality and consistency across the program;
•A large and robust online learning and professional development system that will provide increased, consistent, customized, and focused afterschool information and strategies for the entire 21st CCLC community;
•A communication tool that includes access to State 21st CCLC activity calendars, message boards, blackboards, meeting-conference webinar access, and other community-driven communication tools; 
•A virtual gateway for States and sub-grantees to select from a menu of comprehensive, innovative, and creative best practices and professional development training modules that are specific to the needs of the respective State and/or sub-grantee programs.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any comments on this pre-solicitation notice should be sent to the contacts provided.  Furthermore, the release of this notice in no way obligates ED or the US Government to release a RFP or make an award of any type.     

The Government anticipates that this will be a full and open competition, set-aside for small businesses to be awarded to the offeror who provides the best value; the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  The government anticipates that the resulting contract will be a cost-plus-award-fee.  The Government anticipates the period of performance to consist of a base period of 12-months, and two (2) 12-month option periods (if exercised by the Government). The Department anticipates release of the RFP on July 31, 2008 with a closing date of August 31, 2008.  The RFP will be released on www.fbo.gov with an anticipated award date of September 27, 2008.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS) is processing this acquisition at the request of the USAID and DoS IT Collaboration Project, Joint Program Management Office (JPMO).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the interim infrastructure solution of the project. The acquisition of the specified Stonegate, Cisco, and IPS Proventia hardware products are necessary to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of this infrastructure.During the Joint Management Council (JMC) meeting held on July 25th, 2007, the IT JPMO was tasked to deploy an IT infrastructure at the Tier 1 consolidation posts to support IT as a shared service. To address this direction, the IT JPMO has developed an interim IT infrastructure solution using the industrys best practices.Technically the selected solution is very similar to the current connection that exists between the two networks domestically. That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design. Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems and overall performance. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<p>Justification:  Acquisition of a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope will enable more efficient performance of the work performed at NCI that is dependent on observation of microscopic structures.  This microscope will allow the NCI researchers to observe structures near the cell surface with a "z" resolution beyond what is possible with normal optics.  Furthermore since the rest of the cell is not illuminated, inference from fluorescent molecules inside the cell is greatly reduced, allowing visualization of faint surface features that cannot be seen with other instruments.  In order to study the structures involved in cell adhesion, NCI must also distinguish the cell surface from the immediate area inside the cell, which cannot be done with a confocal microscope.  NCI needs to observe protein translocation in the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, as important molecules pass through the plasma membrane. Dictyostelium discoideum cells are easily damaged by light so the limited light penetration of a TIRF instrument is ideal for this organism.  NCI is also studying the formation and movement of T cell receptor complexes in activated T-cells.  To separate the surface molecules from those that have been internalized NCI needs "z" resolution in the range of the diameter of an endocytic vesicle, about 100nm.  This system will also be used to study protein-protein interactions using Forester Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging with the high "z" resolution of the TIRF instrument in all of these systems.  In order to acquire FRET images, we need to be able to capture 2 images simultaneously.  In the future, this TIRF microscope will be upgraded to allow photobleaching and photoactivation studies.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov or fax (301) 402-4513.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed to the aforementioned individual noted above.  Estimated issued date of the solicitation is July 29, 2008 with an estimated due date of August 12, 2008.  Interested parties must provide a point of contact: name, phone number, fax number, email address, complete mailing address, business size standard, and business name.</p>
<p>No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: RFQ-NCI-80117-MM on all correspondence.</p>

Purchase of any other manufacturer's component would require duplication of the shock and vibration testing performed on the RSI computers at a cost estimated to exceed the cost of the computers being procured.  Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase these RSI computers.  These items will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 334111, SBA Size Standard 1000 employees, FSC 7021.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit SeaRobotics Corporation (SRC) of P.O. box 30909 Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, 33420 on a sole-source basis for two (2) each Autonomous Survey Development Platform (ASDP) unmanned systems.  The ASDP system is man-portable, electrically powered catamaran-style Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) that carries a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) that can dive and maneuver within the water column.  The purpose of the ASDP is to develop systems that remotely or autonomously survey ports, harbors, and estuaries, and address swimmer defense topics such as engagement.  The systems will also be used to test underwater and surface sensors, develop mine hunting strategies, and port security concepts. A project planned for fiscal year 2009 will use the ASDP to develop a swimmer engagement concept. The SRC 2600 hull is an existing product that meets the requirements of the USV section.  SRC's experience with integration of components onto their USV hulls will result in a lower integration cost than will be possible if the integration is performed by the Navy, or if the system must be developed by another party.  The methodology used by SRC for integrating components is ideal for the experimental work planned, and it will avoid the time and expense of redesigning and constructing a new interface system. SRC provides a known good control system for the vehicle that can be extended to the ROV component.  Utilizing this control system will avoid developmental costs and time associated with developing or adapting another control system.   The costs associated with any alternative approaches to integrating the systems were estimated to be at least double the cost of allowing SeaRobotics Corp. to build the systems, and the alternative approaches may preclude the systems from being a available for the project start in 2009.  Equipment will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, SAS, intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole-source basis to UpToDate, Inc., 95 Sawyer Road, Waltham, MA  02453-3471, for a one-year base period with two one-year option periods.  The acquisition is for continued access to the UpToDate online clinical reference service at 12 Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities for 952 physicians.  

IHS is responsible for the provision of high quality direct health care services to American Indian and Alaska Native people through a large network of hospitals and clinics distributed through 35 states.  Because of rapidly changing knowledge in all fields of medicine, it is impossible for physicians and other clinicians to possess all information necessary to make the myriad clinical decisions with which they are faced on a daily basis.  The provision of quality medical care requires IHS and its facilities to provide clinical information and decision support resources—especially internet-based tools that are intuitive to use, quick, and updated regularly.  This information can be a matter of life or death for patients.

IHS requires system-wide access to an internet-based resource that quickly and accurately permits clinicians to drill down to specific information about medical symptoms, syndromes, and disease conditions.  The type of information required includes general descriptions of disease conditions, presenting symptoms and differential diagnosis, approaches to evaluation including laboratory and radiologic testing, treatment options, and recommended follow-up.  The information presented must reflect current literature, best practices, and expert recommendations; it must be updated regularly to reflect current medical knowledge and practice, so that IHS physicians have access to the best available data.  The system must be intuitive to navigate without specific training and must offer easy to use search options as well as topic menus and hyperlinks that enable the user to refine the search and quickly access the specific information that is sought.  The system must assist in reducing adverse events from patient care, decrease complication rates, improve patient safety and shorten hospital length of stay.

The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  IHS has subscribed to the UpToDate online clinical reference service since Fiscal Year 2002.  The service has become integrated into clinical practice in IHS, and both users and administrators across the system depend on it to assist in delivering quality health care.  

UpToDate hospitals have clearly shown in studies that the average length of stay was reduced and the complications rate was lowered when clinicians had access to the online reference tool.  Clinicians who have UpToDate information change the way they managed the patient’s care which results in a lesser error rate, a shorter hospital stay, and reduced rate of complications in a patient’s care.  UpToDate provides the most current, relevant, and evidenced-based medical information needed at the point of care.  Additionally, UpToDate is solely a subscriber funded supplier of medical information and does not accept commercial support of any kind unlike other medical information suppliers.  UpToDate is also ACCME accredited so clinicians can use CME credits for maintaining medical licenses.

Based on the above, the Government believes UpToDate to be unique in its ability to satisfy this requirement.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing that they can meet the Government’s requirement by July 29, 2008.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole-soure award to UpToDate.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 511210.

This  is a SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide essential technical assistance in evaluating the design, development, implementation and outcomes of the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAO) Quality Improvement (QI) projects, utilize a consistent and approved protocol for the evaluation of the MAO QI projects, maintain and update any guidance documents as specified by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and maintain a record for tracking all QI projects by MAO, by region, focus areas, and the targeted diseases.  The contractor will provide technical assistance and training on the use of the materials and manuals that will be used to the target MAOs.  The objective of this effort will be the provision of expert guidance in the ongoing review of QI projects consistent with regulatory requirements.

Background:

Medicare Advantage Organizations are required by CMS regulations at 42 CFR 422.152(a)(1), (2) and (3) to implement quality improvement projects and chronic care improvement programs, and to encourage its providers to participate in CMS and The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) quality improvement initiatives.  Currently, MAOs are implementing projects of their own choosing and using their own inclusion criteria and quantitative indicators to measure improvement over time.  

This special study aims to improve reliability and validity of the MAOs quality improvement projects through the development of standardized project implementation guides including the use of existing consensus-based Health Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) measures for the topic areas indicated above. The projects and programs will then be evaluated for demonstrable improvement at the MAO contractor level and for the Medicare Advantage (MA) program overall. 

CMS annually evaluates the quality submissions from MAOs, including their HEDIS, Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Satisfaction (CAHPS), and Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) data as well as their quality improvement and chronic care improvement projects.  Additionally, starting in 2008 CMS will work with those health plans that are the lowest performing in specific areas including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, influenza vaccine and pneumonia vaccine.  CMS will require MAOs to focus on one specific clinical area in which they should improve their overall performance, thereby improving the delivery of preventative services to beneficiaries.  CMS intends to employ contractors to assist health plans to design a quality improvement project focused on improving clinical performance.  Contractors will work with the plans to formulate interventions that will be most effective in achieving the desired effect.  Moreover, throughout the course of the quality improvement project, the Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) will provide valuable technical assistance to the health plans and ultimately assist with the evaluation of the project.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency is issuing this announcement on behalf of US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Risk Management Agency (RMA) to SEEK INFORMATION from sources that have the capability of demonstrating the following: 
The ability to perform an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change for the crop insurance program administered by the Risk Management Agency for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) and delivered by authorized insurance providers (AIP’s).  

This analysis would use the assessments from the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07285.pdf and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-3/sap4-3-draft3.pdf to establish sound estimates of expected future conditions.  Key components of such an analysis may include: (1) realistic scenarios of future losses under anticipated climatic conditions and expected exposure levels along with a baseline (no impact due to climate change or no climate change) scenario; (2) the potential budgetary implications and consequences of these scenarios for FCIC and AIP’s; and (3) potential mitigation options that the FCIC might use to reduce exposure to loss. 

The development of a program impact model is required to express potential climate changes as changes in mean or variance of crop yields or shifts in production areas.  The model should have the capability to analyze the budgetary impacts climate change (or baseline) scenarios have on FCIC and on AIP’s under current terms, or potential alternative terms, of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) between the FCIC and the AIP’s.
Studies have indicated that global temperatures are increasing and are projected to continue increasing.  Warming is expected to change rainfall patterns.  Increased drought is possible in many regions of the U.S. while rainfall could increase in other areas.  The frequency and severity of extreme events are also expected to increase.  These factors could have a major impact on U.S. agriculture and consequently, FCIC and AIP’s.

Interested firms must possess the following:

Skill and experience in conducting studies of climate change and how climate change will affect insurance.  Skill and experience in modeling climate change scenarios and their resulting impacts on an insurance industry.  The ability to quickly analyze the present crop insurance infrastructure, including the standard reinsurance agreement requirements, as well as, the information contained in the Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.3 “The effects of climate change on agriculture, land resources, water resources, and biodiversity”.  The ability to use this analysis to formulate a plan to conduct a study of climate change and how it affects the crop insurance infrastructure.  

Interested firms may provide proof of previous studies of climate change and it affects on insurance by providing copies or extracts of these studies.  Interested firms should also provide a sample plan of how they would approach a study of climate change using the information contained in SAP 4.3 and its affect on the crop insurance infrastructure. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
Interested vendors must submit in a separate cover page their point of contact information along with their Tax Identification Number (TIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS) and business size. Please ensure that your firm is currently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) and is currently certified in the Online Representation and Certification (ORCA) (https:// orca.bpn.gov). 

CLOSING DATE:                     TIME: 4PM Central Standard Time 
Interested vendor shall submit their information via email to Contract Officer Steven Prado at: steven.prado@kcc.usda.gov by the closing date of this RFI. If you have questions regarding this RFI, please submit your inquiries via email to steven.prado@kcc.usda.gov.

The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation terms and conditions, and represents the best value to the Government.  Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable' in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (hereinafter referred to as the “NHTSA”) intends to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract with Columbia University to provide data from advancements in research and development to improve the Simulated Injury Monitor (SIMon) finite element (FE) head model, which is a tool that incorporates NHTSA’s latest understanding of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) mechanisms to predict the injury potential of car crashes. NHTSA’s Human Injury Research Division (HIRD) has developed the Simulated Injury Monitor (SIMon), a computational finite element model to predict the injury potential of crash loading. This contract will: 

1)	Measure constitutive properties of brain anatomical structures:  Using two complimentary methods (sinusoidal atomic force microscope indentation and stress relaxation micro-indentation), the Contractor will  measure viscoelastic material properties at a spatial resolution to accurately measure material inhomogeneity at the same spatial resolution as the brain’s anatomical structures.  This data will equip SIMon to make anatomically relevant predictions of tissue deformation, specifically:

a.	  Anisotropic material properties will be measured for different brain regions: cortex (within specific layers), hippocampus (within specific subfields), corpus callosum, brain stem, subcortical white matter (thalamus), and cerebellum by preparation of orthogonal samples. 
b.	Material properties will be measured in young (1-3 year old human equivalent) and adult animals to determine age dependence for accurate SIMon simulations of pediatric and adult injury.
c.	Material properties will be measured in multiple species including rat, pig, and human brain samples for cross validation of results.  
2)	Discover functional tolerance criteria:  The contractor will quantify changes in electrophysiological function of both the living cortex (largest mass) and living hippocampus (most vulnerable and involved in learning and memory) in response to precisely controlled mechanical injuries.  From this data, functional tolerance criteria will be developed relating input mechanical parameters (tissue strain and strain rate) to alterations in function.  These criteria will provide SIMon with the enhanced capability to predict functional consequences of traumatic loading, engendering a virtual living surrogate for crash testing.
The proposed contract will be for a base period of twelve (12) calendar months with four (4) renewable, twelve (12) calendar month option periods.  

Interested firms should identify their capability to provide the necessary services as described above. The written response must include detail information relating to the specific service being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of ones ability to provide the necessary services will not be considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals nor is a Request-for-Proposal solicitation document currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, NHTSA intends to request a proposal from Columbia University on a noncompetitive basis for the work described. Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 employees.
Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases.  The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts.  This includes support for clinical research to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.
The Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center for Autoimmune Disease Clinical Trials (SACCC-ADCT) provides critical services for the design, implementation, oversight (including regulatory support and compliance, safety and clinical site monitoring and reporting, training, and distribution and quality control of study products), and analysis of DAIT-supported autoimmune disease clinical trials (ADCT) and associated mechanistic studies being conducted by two cooperative groups:
The Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACE) program is designed to accelerate the discovery, development, and testing of new immunological therapies for autoimmune diseases.  This program fosters collaborations between basic and clinical scientists and supports cooperative single- and multiple-site Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, as well as associated mechanistic studies.  It was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004 to the current 9 sites with a total annual budget of $11.6 million.  Since 2004, 13 protocols have been developed or are in development; of these 6 protocols have initiated enrollment and 3 are in follow-up or have been completed.  The program will be renewed in FY 2009 (RFA-AI-08-010; http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AI-08-010.html) under the co-sponsorship of NIAID, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the NIH Office of Research on Women’s Health. The renewed program is expected to be comparable in size to the current program.
The Stem Cell Therapy Consortium (hereinafter referred to as “Consortium”) was created in 1999 through the award of several contracts to study hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/archive/9931rfp.htm).  The contracts resulted in the opening and active enrollment of clinical protocols using high dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT), followed by HSCT for the treatment of Severe Systemic Sclerosis (SSC) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).  In addition to clinical outcomes, mechanisms of disease, remission and relapse are evaluated as part of these studies. The SSC trial is a Phase II/III pivotal trial evaluating safety and clinical efficacy in subjects with severe, rapidly progressive systemic sclerosis. (See http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00114530.) The Phase II single arm MS trial focuses on safety and the assessment of biological activity using MRI measures and clinical outcomes. (See http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00288626.)
The initial SACCC-ADCT contract was awarded to Rho Federal Systems, Inc. in 2002 (Contract Number N01-AI-25481) and has served to provide a broad range of clinical research support services to the ACE and the Consortium networks.  Under this contract, those services will be continued and will also be expanded to provide support for DAIT-funded investigators conducting autoimmune disease clinical trials (ADCT) outside the ACE and Consortium networks through a variety of mechanisms, for example, the NIAID R34/U01 mechanism (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/clinical/R34.htm).
The contract will provide Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center support for autoimmune disease clinical trials including the activities of the ACE and Consortium.  It is anticipated that up to one cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven years, beginning approximately in July 2009, with an anticipated annual total effort of approximately 16.0 FTEs per annum for the seven year period.
Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:
The Contractor shall establish and manage the SACCC-ADCT to provide statistical, clinical, technical, regulatory and administrative support for autoimmune disease clinical trials and associated mechanistic studies, including support for the following: (1) statistical design and analysis, including interim and final analyses of study data; (2) data collection, management, quality assurance and reporting; (3) regulatory activities, including compliance with Federal and country-specific regulatory requirements and current Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines for research involving human subjects; (4) safety oversight and reporting, including support for the activities of independent Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) and other safety oversight structures; (5) clinical site monitoring and training for clinical site personnel; (6) preparation of study products; (7) distribution and quality control of study products; and (8) establishment and management of a repository for biological specimens.

<SUBJECT>CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF SUBSISTENCE FISHERMEN IN PUERTO RICO
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-8-41834SLW
<RESPDATE>072408
<ARCHDATE>07252008
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The NMFS intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Caribbean Fishery Management Council CFMC) (base period plus 4 options years) to coordinate the work required by the SEFSC to conduct an assessment of subsistence fishermen in Puerto Rico. The CFMC is uniquely qualified to coordinate the work required by the SEFSC to conduct this assessment, particularly considering that local fishery agencies are members of the Council. The government knows of no other organization that exists which is capable of carrying out the necessary work and have the ability to mobilize the required coordinated effort such as, subsistence fishers, fishing organizations, and territorial fishery management scientists and officials in the performance of this project. If this project went to a competitive bid, it is unlikely that any other investigator could provide an equivalent combination of academic and practical experience. Moreover, it is likely that there would be a substantial increase in the cost of the project and potential delays in the implementation of the project.
<p>The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), particularly National Standard 8, (NS 8), National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), and Executive Order (EO) 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations) require that social impact analyses be conducted when federal agencies propose new regulations.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of manpower to conduct a full-blown fishermen assessment, the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) is seeking support to collect socio-economic data to assist in the preparation of fishery management plans and amendments in the U.S. Caribbean. While earlier censuses of Puerto Rican subsistence fishermen are available, these censuses are now outdated and are inadequate to meet the new legal definitions and requirements put forth by MSA, NEPA, and EO 12898. Because of the specific nature of these legal mandates, there is an urgent need to conduct new research consistent with these new definitions and guidelines. Assessments of social impacts on fishing communities cannot be conducted with confidence without the ability to identify the current participants. The objective of the proposed work is to conduct an assessment of subsistence fishermen in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to: a) assess the economic contribution of the fishing to the overall Puerto Rican economy and b) investigate the economic impacts of fishery regulations on coastal communities.</p>
<p><br />DESC: The proposed project will have the following components:</p>
<p>The scope of the proposed work will consist of three sequential tasks: 1) development of survey instrument, 2) surveying, and 3) data entry, statistical summary and report writing.<br />Task 1. Development of survey instrument</p>
<p>The objective of this task is to develop a short, concise survey instrument that collects the same information collected in earlier census. The survey instrument will update the historical, baseline information which may include a few additional questions to capture new developments in the fishery.</p>
<p>A short report will be produced at the end of this task. The paper will discuss the rationale for the proposed survey questions and sampling strategy. The grantee shall work in close cooperation with SEFSC staff in development of the survey instrument and sampling strategy.</p>
<p>Task 2. Fieldwork.</p>
<p>After revising the survey instrument and sampling design based on the contractor's recommendations, NMFS staff will approve the final version of the questionnaire and sampling strategy. At this point the fieldwork will commence. It is essential that contractors' document the non-response rate for the research and identify why people refuse or do not participate in the study. The timing of the data collection will be determined by the contractor in consultation with NMFS staff.</p>
<p>Task 3. Estimation of impacts and documentation</p>
<p>The final task of the project will include the following subtasks:</p>
<p>1) Database design, data entry and quality control. The contractor will develop a database structure in EXCEL, dBase or other similar software that is available to NMFS researchers. Also, the contractor will develop a code book to define variables in the database. To assist with quality control, the contractor will provide simple summary statistics for all variables, including mean, min, max, number of missing observations and frequency distribution. The summary statistics requirement is intended for data quality purposes only to insure that a clean database is developed.</p>
<p>2) Report writing and production. Contractors will prepare a draft and final report. The draft report will be complete, and it is intended that the final report will require only minor changes in response to reviewer comments. This report will summarized all work performed for the contract, including research design and methodology, pre-testing of the questionnaire, fieldwork, development of the database, and quality control of the data. The final report should also discuss the lessons learned and offer recommendations to improve the various aspects and components of the overall data collection as a means for improving future data collection projects. Close communication between the contractor and NMFS staff is expected over the course of the project to ensure a high quality and timely product.</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period is date of award through May 31, 2009 plus 4 option years. The same service performed in the base period will be the same for the option years.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), Geologic Division, Central Region Energy Resources Team (Team), has a requirement for a multi-year lease of software to assist in detailed assessment of energy resources located in and around the United States. This requirement is for a base year and two option years. This agreement shall provide the USGS with a software license, and unlimited access to technical support and regular software maintenance. The USGS Team, along with the Department of Energy, is assessing gas hydrate resources on the North Slope of Alaska. The Team has entered into cooperative agreements with other agencies (both governmental and non-governmental) to share data and expertise in an effort to solve issues dealing with availability, location, and production of gas hydrate. Each of the cooperating partners must be able to incorporate, interpret, and release results in a common OpenWorks database format and must have access to supporting software tools. Software generating and importing/exporting data in the OpenWorks database format is only available from Landmark Graphics Corporation. Landmark Graphics Corporation leases an Advanced Integrated Interpretation Tech Set NG Software, which includes the following software modules:  (1) OpenWorks, (2) SeisWorks 2D, (3) SuperSeisWorks, (4) AssetJournal, (5) OpenVision, (6) Syntool, (7) StratWorks, (8) Zmap+Full Edition, (9) FZAP (10) TDQ, (11) PowerExplorer for OpenWorks, (12) Geodata Loading, (13) PetroWorks Asset, (14) DT Express, (15) PostStack, (16) PostStackESP, (17) PAL, (18) RAVE, (19) SigmaView, and (20) WellBore Planner.  These particular software modules and the resulting software language are required by the USGS to store, log, and share data; and to communicate research results with cooperative partners.

<DESC>FIXED PRICE CONTRACT FOR GAGE AND DISCHARGE SERVICES, 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: POC Mrs. Sarah Palmer 601/631 5682. One (1) Fixed Price Contract will be negotiated and awarded, with a base period and one option period. The anticipated contract award date is November 2008. The work will be accomplished primarily within the Vicksburg District, but may be within the Mississippi Valley Division and other areas as needed to support the mission of the US Army Corps of Engineers. This announcement is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The small business size standard for A-E services is 4.5 million, NAICS code 541330. 2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The work consists of taking a defined number of discharge measurements on a routine basis along the Mississippi, Red, Ouachita Rivers. The measurements will be taken with the use of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and a single beam depth sounder. The data collected will be imported into personal computer software specifically designed to calculate flow measurements. The software (program code) currently in use in the Vicksburg District will be made available during advertisement. The work will also require collecting daily water stage data at approximately 50 gaging sites throughout the Vicksburg District and reporting information daily and monthly to the Vicksburg District. Additional work will consist of maintenance of permanent reference elevation markers at each gaging site and infrequent collection of sediment samples at specific discharge ranges. Extreme flow conditions may require a combination of the ADCP, a single beam depth sounder, and differential GPS. The contractor may be required to take special purpose flow pattern and discharge measurements at lock and dam locations. The contractor may be required to verify his system by comparison with conventional discharge methods. All measurements will be in English units. 3. PRE-SELECTION CRITERIA: Pre-selection will be based on the following considerations, which are of equal importance. The firm (either in house or through association of a qualified consultant) must demonstrate: (a) experience in the use of ADCP systems on rivers such as the Mississippi, Red, and Ouachita Rivers which have high sediment loads, extreme currents, and variations in depths from 10 to 120 feet; (b) the ability to use the ADCP in conjunction with a single beam depth sounder and differential GPS, to produce a single product discharge measurement; (c) experience in discharge measurements by conventional methods; (d) a management plan for collecting, reporting and storing river stage data; and (e) a registered land surveyor in either Arkansas, Mississippi or Louisiana. Deliverables shall be provided in the following format (hard copy, floppy disc, electronic transmission and/or on media approved by the CO). Each discharge reading will list the corresponding date, mean gage reading (feet), maximum depth (feet), width (feet), cross-sectional area (square feet), mean velocity (feet/sec), maximum velocity (feet/sec), overbank discharge (cubic feet), total discharge (cubic feet) and water temperature (degree Fahrenheit). 4. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub criterion). Criteria A thru F are primary. Criteria G thru I are secondary and will only be used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. (A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm and consultants in the work described above in pre-selection items a, b, and c. (B) Knowledge of the navigable waters in the Vicksburg District. (C) Professional qualifications: The firm must indicate professional registration and work experience of key personnel. The firm should emphasize professional registrations, certifications and specific work experience of key personnel. (D) Capacity: The firm should indicate the ability to perform on time regardless of unexpected equipment breakdowns, and/or personnel problems. (E) Past Performance: Consideration will be given to ratings on previous DoD contracts for engineering services. (F) Knowledge of the locality. (G) Geographic proximity to Vicksburg, Mississippi. (H) Department of Defense contract awards in the past 12 months, the greater the awards the lesser the consideration. (F) Extent of participation of SB, SDB, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Minority Institutions (MI) in the contract team. Participation will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner, the greater the participation, the greater the consideration. In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms will be interviewed and will have to demonstrate the ability to perform to the satisfaction of the Vicksburg District. 5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms must send one combined copy of SF 330 for the prime and consultants and Part II of the SF 330 for the prime and each consultant to: U.S. Army Engineer District, Vicksburg, ATTN: Technical Services (CEMVK EC TE), 4155 E.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT ONLY.  It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  Responses to this Sources Sought must be in writing.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge. The Department of Veterans Administration is seeking sources for a potential contractor to provide retinal prosthesis external flexible circuit/electrode array.  Contractor must provide the following requirement:The contractor will deliver 200 polyimide-based flexible circuit/electrode arrays, a one piece flexible multi-layered circuit interconnect with an integrated electrode array which in turn has iridium oxide patterned as the stimulating electrodes, for the continued development of advanced chronically implantable retinal prosthesis prototypes through the development of assembly and encapsulation technologies, and performing and perform accelerated life-time testing of the components.  The contractor must integrate multiple layers of low-resistance biocompatible metal conductor, namely electroplated gold, and a high-charge transfer material, namely sputtered iridium oxide, into a flexible polyimide.  This flexible circuit serves as the interconnect between a titanium case holding the electronics, the power and data coils and the integrated electrode array which, by virtue of being integrated, has now actually become a section of the part to be fabricated.The contractor must be capable of fabricating this flexible circuit/electrode array with a minimum of 3micron-thick electroplated gold metallization to create conductor leads of an 80micron pitch (40micron line and space) sandwiched between flexible layers of polyimide.  The base material shall be 25micron thick polyimide and the cover layer shall be a 5micron coating of polyimide for an overall thickness of 30microns.  The high charge transfer material shall be a sputtered iridium oxide film which must be selectively patterned in specific areas to a 50micron minimum feature size and make electrical contact to the gold metallization.  The contractor must deliver a part which can withstand saline soak testing of at least one year at 37oCThe parts will be tested prior to delivery.  The parts should be packaged in such a manner as to avoid damage during shipping such as layering the parts between non-abrasive rigid panels to avoid allowing the parts to be scratched, bent or creased thereby causing damage to the metal conductors or the sputtered iridium oxide film.Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  All information submitted in response to this announcement must be received by July 21st , 3pm EST.  This information can be faxed or emailed to Kimberly Perkins.  My e-mail address is Kimberly.Perkins3@med.va.gov and my fax number is 774-826-3347.  Responses will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Please no phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Surveillance Data, Inc, 220 West Germantown Pike, Suite 140, Plymouth, MA, 19462, for the gathering of data and data analysis on the impact of rotavirus vaccination on childhood gastroenteritis at the University of Washington's Children's Hospital Medical Center, 4800 Sand Point Way, NE, MS B5520, Seattle, WA 98105. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in US children less than 5 years of age, accounting for more than 30 percent of all severe childhood gastroenteritis episodes requiring medical attention. In 2006, a vaccine for rotavirus was licensed for use in the United States. Surveillance to assess impact of vaccination program against childhood acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a national priority. Linking routinely collected hospital discharge data with their vaccination status will provide an excellent, cost-efficient method of assessing the public health benefits of a rotavirus vaccination program. Since rotavirus disease can vary year to year at any given hospital, having baseline data from 2000-2006 will be important to assess trends in disease since vaccine introduction. The purpose of the purchase order is to obtain data on the incidents of rotavirus in children less than 5 years of age and the vaccination rate associated with those incidents. The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, supplies and facilities necessary to: 1) examine computerized records of outpatient and emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations at Children&rsquo;s Hospital (CH) in Seattle, WA for acute gastroenteritis among children less than 5 years of age during 2000-2008; and 2) to assess trends in all-cause AGE before and after introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in 2006, and provide the data to the Government. Contractor will conduct the following tasks: 1) Review of ED and hospital discharge data. Hospital discharge data for July 1, 2000 through May 31, 2008, shall be reviewed to select those records with specific codes for Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE) in children 0-59 months of age. 2) Linking discharge data with hospital clinical laboratory data: Clinical laboratory data for the period July 1, 2000 through May 31, 2008 shall be reviewed to find results of rotavirus tests routinely ordered by health care providers for children 0-59 months of age. These data will be linked to the ICD-9 discharge data on AGE visits. 3) Immunization data: Vaccination data shall be obtained on rotavirus case-patients from Nov 2007-May 2008 and control patients identified through the emergency department. Data on AGE discharge data from July 1, 2000 through May 31, 2008, rotavirus testing results, and vaccination data on case-patients and a group of control patients as well as an accompanying report with information deemed to be relevant for data analysis and interpretation shall be delivered by June 30, 2009. Data will be submitted on a compact disk in an Excel or other similar flat file. The actual period of performance of the requirement will be August 31, 2008 through August 29, 2009. A contractor is required who has extensive experience in operating surveillance programs focused on the rapid collection and dissemination of data results by specific geographic areas. Data must be provided within 3-4 weeks from the medical encounter, rather than the 1-2 year delay that appears to be the norm. The CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a one time, Fixed Price contract, under commercial item procedures, with Audio Processing Technology (APT). This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.   The FBI has a requirement for WorldCast Dual Meridian units, WorldCast Solo Meridian units, and WorldNet Duo units.  Based on market research and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and the related industry, of other commercially available CODEC transport technologies, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the above listed items can only be provided by the manufacturer, APT, of Watertown, MA.  The APT x-process utilizes a sub-band adaptive differential pulse code modulation technique with the addition of the unique APT x-algorithm to compress each 16 bit digital audio frame into 4 bits without any subjective loss of audio quality. APT is the developer and copyright holder for the APT-x compression algorithm.  Each WorldCast Meridian unit includes a dual port X.21 digital interface employing the Motorola DSP chip with the new (Advanced APT-x) compression algorithm embedded. The WorldCast Dual Meridian units are backward compatible to the first generation of APT-x codecs as utilized by the FBI when the units are operated in the 7.5KHz (64Kb/sec.) mode.  The FBI employs the requested codec units to replace obsolete, discontinued analog voice modems in connection with the FBI's 12 Kilo-bit land mobile radio system.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may provide a written response to this notice and provide evidence to substantiate that capability or submit a response to this office by 2:00 PM, EDT, on Monday, July 21, 2008.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL  has requirements for All-Sensor Advanced Analysis Training Support (AAAT) and Multi-Static Mission Specialists (MSMS).  The purpose of the AAAT program is to provide advanced comprehensive all-sensor analysis training for command, control, communications, computer intelligence (C4I) personnel and on-site all-sensor operators and analysts.  Services for this requirement are currently being provided by Summit Research Corporation under The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston (SPAWAR-Charleston) Contract N65236-05-D-6825 which was competitively awarded on 01 July 2002.  The purpose of MSMS personnel is to teach, evaluate and groom Fleet operator for fleet readiness in Extended Echo Ranging (EER) and Improved Extended Echo Ranging (IEER).  Services for this requirement are currently being provided by RBC Incorporated under Naval Air Warfare Center AD (NAWC-AD) Contract N00421-04-D-0041 awarded on 01 March 2004.

It is the Government's intent to add sole-source the AAAT and MSMS requirements to the Diversified Aircrew Readiness Training (DARTS) task order N61339-00-D-0012-0026 with Fidelity Technologies Corporation.  The DARTS program provides a broad range of training support in a manner that complements the aviation training architecture through the provisions of timely and relevant training materials, instruction, analysis and other related activities. The AAAT and MSMS requirements provide the analysis and teaching of information similar to the information received and taught under the existing DARTS task order.  Namely, all efforts involve post-fleet readiness anti-submarine warfare tactical training and efficiencies are anticipated in the follow-on comprehensive DARTS/AAAT/MSMS task order scheduled for award in August 2009.  This training supports like airframes (P-3, SH-60B and SH-60F) at the same domestic locations.  As the programs support identical airframes at the same locations, there is currently a duplication of effort and costs between the separate existing contract vehicles.  It is the Government’s intention to add the requirements to the DARTS vehicle due to the similarity of technical training services and readiness training areas to accommodate sensor related acoustic and electronic warfare skills critical to fleet readiness, thereby reducing costs and increasing efficiencies.  

The applicable authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii) (A), states services may be deemed to be available only from one responsible source when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No contract or task order will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed by email to the Contract Specialist, Andrea Gordon-Eubanks at andrea.gordon@navy.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must be submitted by 28 July 2008.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future procurement.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS for Integrated Measurement System has the following basic salient characteristics:

•	Portable Imaging System
•	Data for microwave images are acquired by moving antennas on a motorized linear rail while triggering data sweeps incrementally along the rail
•	Center of the microwave image is called the zone center. The typical zone centers for medium ranges are from 15 to 24 feet in front of the antennas. Greater distances can be achieved depending on the details of the RF environment, instrument settings and target. 
•	System is calibrated by using a known standard with precise magnitude and phase responses associated with each frequency and polarization. 
•	System is on a physical support structure to allow it to be positioned so  that the zone center is located at a specific location on the aircraft/target. 
•	Structure provides manual movement in x, y, z (height) and azimuth. The antenna pitch (elevation) is manually operated for 2-18 GHz antennas.  Antennas are aligned with a Position Data System using the aircraft coordinate system-fuselage station (FS), buttline (BL) and waterline (BL). Position algorithm determines the antenna movement required to align to the desired zone center on the aircraft.  
•	Radar Subsystem, Control Interface and the PDS System could operate under as well as on top of the aircraft with Band3 antennas [2 to 18 GHz]. 
•	Computer/Controller Rack and Power Rack are always outside the aircraft shadow line. 
•	Design of the hardware includes circular locking military connectors, drip loops on the cables and no direct top openings for fuel to enter the electronics. 
•	Cooling fans and exhaust vents are IP54 rated. 
•	Sealed switches and sealed relays are used so no spark-generating situations occur during operation.  
•	Most metal parts are powder coated or coated for anti-corrosion.
•	Some exposed materials may be galvanized steel, stainless steel and aluminum.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurement and Grants Office (PGO) intends to award one to four purchase orders for the lease, with an option to buy, of an infrared thermal detection system. These infrared thermal detection systems will be used in an evaluation to determine their reliability in measuring body temperatures as well as their precision and accuracy in comparison to the traditional oral method of measurement in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>This requirement is available for full and open competition. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>

<p>The selection of offerors for contract award will be based on the evaluation of proposals. The contract(s) will be awarded to the offeror(s) whose proposal is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government, technical and cost/price considered. Offerors are advised that in the evaluation process, technical is more important than cost/price. The trade off process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed. This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced or highest technically rated offeror. Further, the system specifications established in the Statement of Work are the minimum required and proposals will be evaluated based on meeting and/or exceeding these minimum requirements. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards under this solicitation to the offeror(s) whose proposal(s) provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to meeting or exceeding the needs of the project as set forth in this solicitation. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below.</p>
<p>Technical proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following technical evaluation criteria and weights:</p>

Section C: Background and Work Statement 

Concerned about the implications of climate change for weather-related losses incurred by federal agencies, Congress directed the GAO to conduct a study to describe what is known about how climate change might affect insured and uninsured losses incurred by federal agencies.  The result of that GAO study directed the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to obtain an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change.  

Description of Work
C.1	Objective

The objective of this contract is to obtain an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change for the crop insurance program –in regard to FCIC and to approved insurance providers (AIP’s) and the development of a program impact model that incorporates the impacts of the implications identified to the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).    This analysis shall use the assessments from the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to establish sound estimates of expected future conditions.  Key components of this analysis shall include: (1) the scenarios under anticipated climatic conditions of Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.3 “The effects of global change on agriculture, biodiversity, land, and water resources”  (See section 5.1) and Risk Management Agency’s expected exposure levels based on the current FCIC book of business along with a baseline (no impact due to climate change) scenario that leads to an estimate of potential future losses for these scenarios; (2) the potential budgetary implications and consequences of these scenarios’ potential future loss estimates for FCIC and AIP’s expressed in the program impact model; and (3) potential mitigation options that the FCIC might use to reduce exposure to loss.  The development of a program impact model is required to express potential climate changes as changes in mean or variance of crop yields or shifts in production areas.  The program impact model shall have the capability to analyze the budgetary impacts climate change (or baseline) scenarios have on FCIC and on AIP’s under current terms, or potential alternative terms, of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).  There shall be training provided to key RMA personnel on the use of the program impact model.

C.2	Scope

The work will require skills and experience in climatology, agricultural meteorology, crop insurance underwriting, agricultural risk management, data analysis, actuarial science, statistical modeling, project planning, scheduling, quality control, categorizing, analyzing, research, critical thinking, innovative problem solving techniques, oral presentations, report writing, and the use of Microsoft product applications.  Travel will also be required.

Many studies have indicated that global temperatures are increasing and are projected to continue increasing.  Warming is expected to change rainfall patterns.  Increased drought is possible in many regions of the U.S. while rainfall could increase in other areas.  The frequency and severity of extreme events are also expected to increase.  These factors could have a major impact on U.S. agriculture and consequently, FCIC and AIP’s.  
C.3	Specific Tasks and Work Requirements

The contractor shall deliver to the government a program impact model and a report that analyze the potential long term implication of climate change for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

C.3.1 	Program Impact Model Concept & Direction Report

The Program Impact Model Concept and Direction Report is to outline the process that the contractor will follow in developing the program impact model that will incorporate the impact of the implications to be identified into the Standard Reinsurance Model.   After submission of the Program Impact Model Concept and Direction Report the contractor will participate with RMA in a teleconference that outlines and discusses what the anticipated inputs and results of the model will be. 

C.3.2	Report and Program Impact Model: Climate Change Impacts on Crop Insurance

The report shall include expected changes in the frequency and severity of weather by region and the corresponding impacts on the expected distribution of crop yields and shifts in production areas. The report shall also include the results of a program impact model of the financial impacts of the expected yield distributions (and corresponding price changes) on both FCIC and AIP’s.  In evaluating the financial impacts on FCIC and AIP’s, the program impact model shall consider current, or potential, risk-sharing terms of the SRA.  The report and program impact model shall also consider whether catastrophic modeling is needed to maintain actuarially sound programs and also consider loss mitigation options such as limiting coverage.  The program impact model shall include a stress testing component.  The report and the program impact model shall analyze at the state/crop/plan of insurance level of aggregation for the major crops in the FCIC book of business.

C.3.3	Summary Report of Climate Change Program Impact Model Stress Tests

The report shall provide a summary of the various scenarios that the contract has arrived at with regards to the Climate Change Program Impact Model and the impact from the various stress tests that the contractor has accomplished. 

C.3.4 	Final Report

After approval of the work outlined in C.3.1, C.3.2, C.3.3 – Draft Climate Change Report, the Program Impact Model Development, the Summary Report of Climate Change, Stress Tests and oral presentation, the contractor shall deliver to the Government a Final Report that summarizes and takes into account any concerns or changes that may be requested by RMA.

Section K: Representations, certifications, and other statements of offerors or respondents

52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (May 2008)
(a)
(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --
(A) Are * are not * presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have * have not *, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(C) Are * are not * presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(2) Examples.
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
(2) “Principals,” for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

Section M: Proposal Evaluation Criteria
M.1   General

a. The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 15.

b. In accordance with FAR 52.215 1 (f), the Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors listed in Section M.3.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This effort will include comparing the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each offer.  

c. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with offerors except clarifications if necessary as described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors' best terms from a technical and price standpoint.

d. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.  
M.2   Basis for Award

The Government will make an award to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value based on the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.4.

FSA has established a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to evaluate proposals submitted for this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated by the TEB members in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR part 15, and the Evaluation Factors hereinafter described.
M.3   Technical Evaluation Factors for Award

Proposals will be rated and ranked on evaluation factors listed below.  Proposals are evaluated based on information in the proposal.  All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  But as technical proposals approach parity, price will become more important.  The proposed prices will be evaluated separately but in conjunction with the technical proposal elements.  A proposed price that is considered by the Government to be too low to accomplish the proposed technical approach may constitute a potential performance risk to the Government in terms of quality and ability to meet delivery schedules.
M.4   Proposal Evaluation Factors (in descending order of importance)
M.4.1	Technical Approach

This factor evaluates the Offeror’s Technical Approach for an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change on crop insurance and the development of a program impact model that incorporates the impacts identified to the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).  Aspects that will be considered include analytical rigor, use of appropriate statistical methods, and knowledge of crop insurance.  Corporate expertise will be evaluated based upon the submitted reports the contractor has completed on climate change impacts to any type of insurance, and climate change models on insurance agreements (The submitted reports can be submitted as part of the contractor’s appendix and therefore is not included in the page limitation for the proposal submission). Key Personnel will be evaluated based on the individual skills, education, and experience of the key personnel proposed for this project.  Individual team member listings shall be limited to one page, utilizing at least 12-point font.
M.4.2	Project Management Plan (WBS, delivery schedule & Quality Control Plan):

Proposals that demonstrate the most effective, efficient and optimal technique to meet the criteria outlined in the solicitation for listed goals, objectives, and requirements found in section C will receive a higher evaluation.
M.4.3	Past Performance:

On this factor the Government will evaluate the quality of previous work products the Offeror and its key personnel have produced.  Offerors that combine greater professional competence with a demonstrated ability to deliver consistently high quality products will receive a higher evaluation.  Aspects to be considered include the customer’s perspective on:

•	Usefulness and value of the services and products delivered (e.g., recommendations in previous work products are generally adopted);
•	The key objectives and initial intent of the contracts are met (customer expectations);
•	Previous work products contained relatively few substantial deficiencies, and the requested corrections are quickly and correctly made or satisfactorily explained; and
•	Previous work products contained detailed, logical, and insightful analysis and recommendation, use of appropriate statistical methods, insight into potential program vulnerabilities, etc.
M.5	Price Evaluation

The Government will evaluate the following areas:
(a)  Price Reasonableness:  The proposal will be evaluated to determine reasonableness of the price.  A comparison of the proposed prices, Independent Government Cost Estimate, and/or market values will be used to evaluate price.  Should price competition not exist, a cost analysis may be necessary to establish price reasonableness.

(b)  Price Realism:  The Offerors are placed on notice that any offers that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the offer.

(c)  Cost Realism:  Cost realism may be performed, if appropriate, as part of the offer’s evaluation process.  The purpose of this evaluation shall be:

(1)  To verify the offeror understands the requirements
(2)  To assess the degree to which cost/price offers reflects the approaches and/or risk assessment made in the technical proposal as well as the risk the offeror will provide the supplies or services for the offered price/cost; and
(3)  Assess the degree in which the costs included in the cost/price proposal accurately represents the work effort included in the technical offer.
M.6  Evaluation Method

To be considered acceptable and eligible for evaluation, offers shall be prepared in accordance with and comply with the instructions set forth in this solicitation.

M.7  The Government will rank the offeror’s capabilities for “Technical Approach Methodology”, “Project Management Plan” and “Past Performance”, using the following rating system.
 

	Evaluation Rating Standards 
Rating 	Standard 
Exceptional 	An exceptional factor contains significant strengths and no weaknesses.  The factor exceeds the 
	performance and technical requirements defined in the SOW. The factor offers value-added methodologies for improving service that benefits the Government.  The evaluator has no doubt 
	that the Offeror can successfully achieve the requirements in the SOW if the technical proposal proposed is followed.  The Offeror acknowledges risks and develops an approach that proactively 
	identifies and mitigates risks, and looks to reduce or eliminate future risks. 
Good 	A good factor contains significant strengths, and only a few minor weaknesses.  The Offeror’s 
	factor meets the performance and technical requirements as defined in the SOW.  The evaluator has a high degree of confidence that the Offeror can successfully achieve the requirements in the 
	SOW if the technical proposal proposed is followed.  The Offeror acknowledges technical or schedule risk and develops an approach capable of mitigating all apparent risks effectively. 
Acceptable 	An acceptable factor contains strengths that outweigh any existing weaknesses.  The Offeror’s 
	factor meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the SOW.  The 
	evaluator is confident that the Offeror can successfully achieve the requirements in the SOW if the technical proposal proposed is followed.   
Marginal 	The factor meets the bare minimum performance and technical requirements defined in the 
	SOW, and at the same time have significant weaknesses.  The evaluator is not confident that the 
	Offeror can successfully complete the required tasking without significant Government oversight or participation. The factor either fails to address risks or the quoted risk mitigation 
	approach is not deemed to be sufficient to manage the risk. 
Unacceptable 	An unacceptable factor that contains one or more significant weaknesses and deficiencies.  
	Factor fails to meet specified minimum performance and technical requirements defined in the SOW.  The evaluator is confident that the Offeror will be unable to successfully complete the 
	required tasking. The factor does not adequately acknowledge or address risk, mitigate risk, or may actually introduce risk.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a One-Dimensional Universal Length Measuring Machine (ULM) to be used by the Engineering Metrology Group at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

Background
The Engineering Metrology Group provides measurement services in the area of dimensional metrology for customer artifacts from 0.1 mm up to 1000 mm in length.  Our current universal length measuring machine is a SIP 550 and has been retrofitted with a laser interferometer because the inherent scale accuracy of the instrument as procured was not sufficient for the measurements required.  The system still uses the original control board and computer system for all motor controlled movements of the instrument and the electronic measurement force setting control.  In the instrument’s current state, instrument can not be serviced but can be completely refurbished.   The major concern is that failure of the instrument’s controller and/or PC could mean that several standard measurement services would be indefinitely halted.  After researching the upgrade/refurbishment of the current SIP 550 system with Heidenhain’s best linear scale revealed that the structure and design of the instrument will not support the desired performance.  The ultimate goal was to improve the machine’s scale accuracy, thus making the laser interferometer system available for other applications and changing the scale measurement to one that was less sensitive to environmental fluctuations (i.e., atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure (relative humidity)).  

This is a BRAND NAME or EQUAL requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency’s needs.***


***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  

Line Item 0001:  Quantity One (1) Each, One-Dimensional Universal Length Measuring Machine (ULM) with a minimum of 600 mm length measuring capacity


Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

The instrument shall provide PC controlled movement: in the measure direction, z-axis support table movement, and electronic measurement force setting/control.  The instrument shall be capable of measuring inside and outside lengths and diameters and the major diameter and pitch diameter of straight and tapered thread gages.  The support stage of the instrument shall minimally provide manual adjustments for part rotation, part translation front to back (y-direction), and part tilt in the XZ plane.  The support table must provide for free-floating movement parallel to the length measurement direction to provide part self positioning between the instrument contacts aided only by the applied force of the instrument.  In addition to z-axis motion control, the z-axis should be retrofitted with a linear encoder and position readout allowing precise vertical positioning of the artifact to 0.05 mm.

Contractor shall provide a Precimar Universal Length Measuring Machine, Model: CiM-828 or EQUAL with the following salient characteristics:

Measuring range:  External Measurement:  0 to 600 mm
Resolution/scale unit:  0.01 um or better
Repeatability/Reproducibility:  &#8804; 0.03 um
Measuring Force Range:  0 to 11.1 N
Support Table Vertical Movement Range with Position Output:  &#8805; 70 mm
Support Table Vertical Movement Incremental Capability:  0.05 mm
Support Table must allow for the following adjustments:
-	measurement direction (X-axis) floating movement
-	transverse direction (Y-axis) adjustment
-	tilt adjustment about Y-axis)
-	swivel movement about Z-axis
Support Table Load capacity:  &#8805; 111 N
Measuring Uncertainty:  E1        X axis (0.075+L/1500)

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. ***

The NIST owned system discussed in the “Background” statement above is available for trade-in.  The system is currently in excellent condition, fully functional with all standard accessories.  If Offeror will accept said trade-in, the quotation submitted shall include a “discount” associated with the trade-in.  This discount, if offered, will be considered during price evaluation.

NIST requests that the trade-in take place one year after delivery and acceptance of system offered as a result of this solicitation in order to allow for calibration procedure and documentation development providing an uninterrupted transition from one instrument to the other for customer calibrations.  The trade-in of the SIP550 will be executed at the end of this 1 year evaluation period.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Sampling Contract to Evaluate the Effect of Net Marking Lights on the Interaction Rates of Leatherback Sea Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in Trinidad's Artisanal Mackerel Gillnet Fishery<br />C.1 SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide equipment, personnel (to include at-sea observers and port samplers) and all other material necessary to complete the work identified below according to the standards, procedures, and requirements outlined in this document.</p>
<p>C.2 BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>C.2.1 The single largest threat to the Critically Endangered leatherback turtles in Trinidad, and arguably through-out the Atlantic Ocean, is the accidental capture of the species in coastal gillnet fisheries. The entanglement problem in Trinidad also places a severe strain on the ability of fishers to operate economically, and is so severe that many are unable to fish during the leatherback nesting season. In a number of studies, it is estimated that as many as 3,000 entanglements occur each year in Trinidad and that as much as 35% of those entanglements result in the death of the turtle (Fournillier and Eckert 1999; Eckert and Lien 1999; Lee Lum, 2003, Gass, 2005).</p>
<p>C.2.2 The Trinidadian fishery with the highest leatherback sea turtle bycatch rate is the surface drift gillnet fishery prosecuted along nesting beaches on the Northern and Eastern coasts. Nets used in this fishery are 10 to 15 meters deep and are often fished in waters less than 25 meters deep. These nets are very effective at capturing a number of species but king mackerel (Scomberomorous cavalla) and Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) bring the highest price and are the most sought after species. Mackerel tend to spend most of their time in the upper portion of the water column, which is why surface drift gillnets are the preferred gear. However, gillnets employed in this fishery may fish deeper than required to catch mackerel, resulting in bycatch of many other species including leatherback sea turtles.</p>
<p>C.2.3 In 2006, NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and the Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network (WIDECAST) initiated cooperative research to examine the effect of fishing depth and net depth or "profile" on target catch and leatherback bycatch rates in the mackerel drift gillnet fishery. The first study compared identical nets fished at different depths (Gearhart and Eckert 2007). Although no sea turtles were captured during this study, results indicated that the upper five meters of the water column was the most productive portion for targeting mackerel. A follow up study was conducted in 2007 during peak leatherback nesting in areas with the highest bycatch rates to examine the effect of net depth or "profile" on target catch and leatherback bycatch rates. Traditional nets 10 meters deep were compared to five meter deep experimental nets designed to target the most productive portion of the water column. The experimental net captured 29 turtles, 68% fewer than the control, which captured 90 turtles. However, results differed between ports with the experimental net reducing sea turtle bycatch by 74% in the eastern port and only 11% in the northern port. Upon further investigation, the use of net marking lights was identified as the potential cause for the disparity observed between ports. The eastern port did not use lights while the northern port used a single light to mark the end of the string of nets. The light was placed in between two experimental nets, which may have confounded results.</p>
<p>C.2.4 Following the 2007 study, an informal survey of local fishermen found that many often use lights to mark their nets when fishing near shipping lanes to prevent large vessels from running through their gear. Anecdotal information from several fishermen indicated that they observe many of the interactions in the last portions of the gear where the lights are usually placed. In addition, residents employed by a local conservation organization to monitor the leatherback nesting populations in the area have long been aware of the leatherback's attraction to white light. Only red or amber lights are allowed on the beach during nesting to prevent temporarily blinding the turtles. However, if turtles stray into rivers or other undesirable nesting areas, white lights are used to consistently lead them back to the beach. This information suggests that removing or changing the color of the lights used to mark nets may reduce leatherback sea turtle bycatch in the drift gillnet fishery. Not only will the results of this research be beneficial to gillnet fisheries it may also be applicable to longline fisheries.</p>
<p>C.3 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: <br />The work described herein shall be performed over a three month period from on or about August 1, 2008 through on or about November 1, 2008.</p>
<p>C.4 DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</p>
<p>C.4.1 The goal of this study is to compare catch and bycatch of low profile gillnets lighted with white light vs. red light. The objectives of the study are:</p>
<p>a) Compare the catch rates of target species of finfish for each net type.<br />b) Compare the catch rates of bycatch species of finfish for each net type.<br />c) Compare the catch rates of sea turtles for each net type.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct sixty fishing trips between on or about August 1, 2008 and on or about November 1, 2008 on traditional fishing grounds along the East coast of Trinidad. The Contractor shall provide two commercial gillnet vessels, one each from the ports of Toco and Matelot, to set and retrieve nets daily. The Contractor shall make up to two sets per fishing trip. The initial sets shall be made at dusk and soak times of all sets shall be at least 4 hours in length. Each vessel shall test red lights vs. white lights using the methodology described herein. Low profile (50 mesh) nets shall be used throughout the study to minimize potential for leatherback sea turtle morality. Lights should be mounted to standardized net marking poles at identical distances off the water. White light controls and red light experimental treatments should consist of Lindgen-Pitman Electralume fishing lights. The Contractor shall use a matched pair experimental design throughout the study with each vessel setting ten 100 yard nets connected to form a single string of nets. The first five and last five contiguous nets shall serve as two separate experimental units. Experimental and control treatments shall be applied to each unit separately with lights mounted at opposing ends and in the middle of each unit to minimize confounding effects. Experimental and control treatments shall be switched between experimental units daily to account for potential vessel proximity bias. Contractor-provided at-sea observers shall record effort and sea turtle bycatch attending trips on the data sheet shown at Appendix 1b by net location and net type, experimental or control. Contractor-provided port samplers shall sample total catch dockside and record catch on the data sheet shown at Appendix 1a by port, species, and net type.</p>

The field of view shall be shielded from the exhaust gases, oil, effluence and air turbulence.  Glass, plastic, or other window material shall not be interposed between the camera or digital image system and the ground to be imaged unless authorized by Mr. Shane Green.  Helicopter must have an exterior camera mount that is motion compensated and vibration free such as a "Foley" mount.  The mount shall be able to pan and zoom.  If the helicopter has its own video camera, the video output must be of broadcast quality or higher (520 lines resolution full color) and recorded on mini DV tape or video hard drive.  If it does not have its own camera, the mount must be able to carry a Sony HDV professional camera using Mini DV tape (camera and tapes supplied by NRCS in this case).

The aircraft shall have onboard, operational and integrated GPS receiver wiht a FAA certified antenna for recording the track of the video imagery.  The GPS shall be able to record a track with a component of continuous time.  The GPS shall be able to receive real time differential correction signals where available.

Video imagery shall be acquired during conditions when well defined, high detail images will be resolved.  It is preferred that the skies be clear, free from smoke, clouds, cloud shadows, and excessive haze.  Due to the overriding need to acquire quality imagery within the specified period, it may be necessary to acquire some imagery that is outside the above requirements.  The contractor is permitted to exercise judgment in acquiring images.  NRCS reserves the right to reject imagery if it is impossible to be used for the intended purpose of interpretation for data collection.

The video image capture period for this project shall be during times when riparian vegetation is actively growing.  Generally, the date range would be June 1 to September 1, depending on the elevation.

NRCS desires the video imagery be acquired only during the portion of the day when the sun angle exceeds the minimum of 30 degrees above the horizon.  However, to expedite the acquisition within the shortest number of days possible, NRCS will accept a sun angle of not less than 20 degrees, provided the imagery does not have extensive shadows that preclude interpretation for data collection.

All flights shall be parallel with the river channel and be as continuous as possible.  Flight direction can be either upstream or downstream at the contractor’s discretion, but only one or the other for the video capture in its entirety.  The aerial perspective should be gained at the lowest possible altitude while conforming with the site/area coverage requirements, camera lens constraints, and safety considerations.  Appropriate speeds for the video capture will be as fast as possible at the contractor’s discretion.

Quality Control shall be exercised continuously throughout the performance of the contract.  Procedures shall be developed to assure that all the video imagery and synchronized GPS Tracks are delivered in accordance with the delivery schedule and at the required level of quality.

If the contractor’s camera is used, the video capture will be transferred to DVD(s) or hard drive(s) for delivery to the NRCS.  If the NRCS’s camera is used, the NRCS will maintain backups and management of the camera recording media.  The GPS track, if seperate, shall be recorded to an electronic medium such as a DVD or CD for delivery to the NRCS.

Questions concerning this procurement action shall be addressed to steve.latimer@ut.usda.gov, 801-524-4578, or shane.green@ut.usda.gov, 801-524-4567.

<DESC>A.	The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), under the auspices of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Multifamily and Healthcare Asset Sales Program (Program), intends to sell certain of its multifamily and healthcare portfolio of HUD-held notes. These notes primarily consist of loans that were assigned to HUD after default by a borrower or co-insuring lender. HUD intends to satisfy its Program requirements through the use of a performance-based contract. HUD is using the less-prescriptive Statement of Objectives (SOO) provided herein; versus the previous Statement of Work (SOO).  The SOO combines loan due diligence and transaction (sale) requirements for services to support the asset sale activities for HUD-held notes secured by multifamily housing properties, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and hospitals located nationwide.

B.	Based on the SOO, a performance work statement (PWS) shall be developed by the Contractor that describes: 1) the end results to be achieved; 2) the proposed performance standards and acceptable quality levels of the work performed; 3) a measurable Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to assure that the end results meet quality and acceptable levels; and 4) an incentive/disincentive structure that motivates the Contractor to achieve HUD’s stated objectives.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

By this we mean a list of the menus offered to callers when calling into the system.
The menu system is fairly basic.  Below is the general flow prior to the failing of the previous system. 
 
a. Direct transfer to an existing Admissions extension.
b. A candidate with an open file can be transferred to their geographic representative by entering their 5-digit zip code.
c. Callers interested in becoming candidates are transferred to a voicemail system to leave their mailing address information. This information is manually updated to Mailback and the caller will receive all subsequent Mailback mailings.
 
d. Callers interested in scheduling an orientation visit are transferred to our Cadet Public Relations Center (CPRC) to obtain a date and time for their visit.
e. Field Force members or Congressional Staffers are transferred to appropriate Admissions representatives based on their 5 digit zip codes.
f. Callers interested in hearing the steps in the Admissions process may do so via the electronic bulletin board system.
 
 
2.  Please provide a sample of each of the 5 reports referenced in the SOW.  These may be scans or faxes of reports you have on file.
Samples are not provided.  Instead, we look for basic graphs portraying statistical information for trends across time such as: Call Volume, Types of calls (destination of calls), hang-ups, time to pickup, and geographic origin of call (if possible).
 
3.  If the IVR is to provide functionality beyond what may be satisfied through candidates use of the menus listed in item 1, please describe.
I dont foresee additional sub-menus to be needed.  However, I do see the possibility of adding additional top-level selections.
 
4.  The name and telephone number of the person who can approve menu phrases that will be incorporated into the IVR will be needed.
Contact fulya.patrick@fedbid.com if this information is needed prior to submitting your bid.
 
5.  How many telephone ports will be required in connecting the IVR to the Avaya Definity G3 switch?

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<BR><BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) directly to koplendj@state.gov (NOT THROUGH FEDBID.COM) so that they are received at that email address no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation.<BR><BR>Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).<BR><BR>Pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2512(a)) (TAA), Federal acquisitions of supplies may be made only from offerors that will supply products of an eligible country under any of the free trade agreements entered into pursuant to the TAA. An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>During the United Nations General Assembly opening debate in New York City, DoS must support meetings held by various senior leadership with European leaders.  Because of the regions unique level of consultation and engagement with the United States on all foreign policy issues worldwide, and the unusual number of foreign leaders present in the city during this critical period, EUR must support an unusually high number of meetings (66 last year), most of which are held at and supported from the bureaus control room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.  The support requirements are complex and demanding: schedules change daily; note takers must be provided for each meeting and immediately available in case of scheduling changes.  Because of the limited number of rooms available at the Waldorf-Astoria, EUR requires additional accommodations.  It is imperative that EUR staff are accommodated nearby, and that the hotel be able to provide, insofar as possible, flexibility in scheduling.<BR><BR>There is a continuing requirement for additional rooms beyond those immediately available on-site at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in order to adequately support the numerous meetings with European and Eurasian leaders to be held by the Secretary, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and other senior leadership. With four of the working staff staying in New York long term we would also like to request a refrigerator inside four of the rooms.<BR><BR>New York City, New York. ***Hotel should be within  mile of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel***<BR><BR>September 19, 2008 to October 3, 2008<BR><BR>Upon conclusion of the conference, the hotel shall submit a single invoice to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for the following: Lodging<BR><BR>The hotel shall ensure standard security for all participants (room safes for valuables and laptops).<BR><BR>QUESTION: I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THESE ROOMS ARE SINGLES AND WOULD THEY QUALIFY FOR THE GOVERNMENT RATE? Answer: We are aware that Government per diem during that time is impossible.  Yes they are singles, however four of them should have kitchenettes/refrigerators.
QUESTION: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE WALDORF, SAY, WITHIN A MILE?Answer: The hotel should be  mile to the Waldorf-Astoria.
QUESTION:WHAT IS THE BILLING PROCESS?Answer: Invoicing instructions will be provided on the order. Generally, the hotel invoices Department of State and we pay within 30 days of receiving a proper invoice.
QUESTION: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HOTEL RATING OR PRICE RANGE WE'RE LOOKING AT? DO I CHECK DAYS INN (130.00) OR MARRIOTT MARQUIS?(550.00) Answer: We prefer hotels along the lines of Marriott Marquis.<BR><BR>

The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers for this requirement, note that the questions and answers have corresponding numbers:Questions:
1.Does the government know in what portion of the IR spectrum this system should operate (i.e., SWIR, MWIR, LWIR)?
2.If a Stirling engine is needed for cooling the FPA -- should that also run on battery?  And if so for how long?  Stirling cryocoolers use up, for examples, about 60 W for 1 W of cooling power.  By the time we add up all other electronics, the power consumption is significant, to require a heavy duty battery (which makes the system less portable).  Along those lines, what would be considered portable? 3. Do the lens need to have zoom capability or just interchangeable?4. What positional accuracy are you trying to achieve from flight?5. What is the mission duration time, ground and flight?
Answers:1. The system shall be able to operate in the Near InfraRed (NIR) or 0.7 - 1.0 microns to the Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR) or 1.0 - 3.0 microns. The Midwave InfraRed (MWIR) or 3-5 microns and the Longwave InfraRed (LWIR) or 5-14 microns is desirable but not required. 
2. All  electronics critical to operation of the instrument are expected to run on battery orother portable power supply. Portability is defined as the unit being able to carried by hand by a single person, or the unit with all its critical operational electronics placed on a small cart or hand truck and manuvered, over short to medium distances (10 -100 meters).  Critical electronics is defined as all systems and subsystems needed for data collection. Subsystems such as computers used for post-processing or analysis of data are not critical if the device can collect data without them. 
3. The changeable lenses are to provide differing Field(s) of View (FOV) for when the instrument is collecting data at or near the ground and when the instrument is airborne. A zoom lens would not be sufficient.
4. Positional accuracy shall have a RMSE of less than 4 meters. 
5. Mission duration time is highly variable. Data collection can range from 5 -10 minutes for a typical aerial data flightline to hours for a ground based data collection. The purpose of this modification is to delete the description "FLIR."  All other terms and conditions shall remain the same. Infrared Imaging SensorThis is a combined solicitation for commercial items exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, although prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.

1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC><p><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) QUESTIONS FOLLOW-UP&nbsp; (#2)<br /></strong>For <br />USAF C-20B/H Aircraft Defensive System <br />On the initial RFI, the C-20 Program Office requested respondents to identify an IRCM system that is scalable for a C-20B/H aircraft and their capability of installing, integrating and certifying the identified IRCM defensive system. Thank you for responding to the initial RFI. The C-20 Program Office has elected to pursue a jamming-based LAIRCM system and will not be considering material dispensing systems.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC)/727ACSG Tinker Air Force Base, OK is conducting market research to identify installation capabilities and commercial costs of a Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM), jamming-based, defensive system for the USAF C-20B/H aircraft. This capability is planned to be integrated and fielded through FY14.</p>
<p>If you have not submitted a response to the initial RFI, please include the requested information in addition to the response requested below.</p>
<p>The C-20 Program Office submits this 2nd RFI to further understand industry recommended solutions/availability and catalog/market prices as they pertain to a jamming-based LAIRCM system. Please respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. The Government has access to the LAIRCM "B Kits" that could be provided as GFE; however, we will consider alternative systems that might provide better value that are mature, readily available, and in production status. Please answer the following questions in regards to the above statement:<br />a. Do you have a commercial off the shelf (COTS) system or "B Kit" readily available today? Is it in production?<br />b. Please provide your published commercial catalog price for this system and/or "B Kit."<br />2. What experience have you had installing a jamming-based LAIRCM system (please disregard if you have previously addressed)?<br />3. Have you performed a LAIRCM, jamming-based, effectiveness analysis on a Gulfstream III/IV or similar Gulfstream aircraft?<br />4. What is your plan to attain Gulfstream III/IV aircraft&nbsp;technical information from Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, if required?<br />5. If a large business (1500 employees or more), how do you plan to meet small business goals?<br />6. What applicable experience and successes have you had in developing/providing technical data, and acquiring FAA certification approval (i.e. STC)?</p>
<p>Email responses are preferred; however, all information submitted will be accepted either in hard or soft copy form. The Government requests responses to this RFI to be submitted no later than 3:00 PM CST (Central Standard Time) on 21 July 2008. Respondents should identify their company's name, address, telephone number, and point of contact on packaging and title pages. Company name should appear clearly on every page of your submittal and proprietary information must also be clearly marked. Please limit responses to 20 pages or less (attachments or brochures are not to be included in the page count).</p>
<p>RFI Response Ship to Address: <br />OC-ALC/327ASW/727ACSG/PKG<br />Bldg 3001 Staff Drive Post #1AD2 105A<br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145<br />(Attn: Ms. Linda Cumberworth)</p>
<p>Please refer any questions regarding this RFI to Linda Cumberworth or Lt Jacob Moreno.<br />The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with submittal of this request for information.</p>

<DESC>The due date for the submission of responses is extended to July 25, 2008.Please note that NASA is not soliciting proposals at this time. Currently these servicesare contracted for by each NASA Center. NASA is gathering data to help us decide if weshould consolidate the requirement under one contract. If NASA decides to contract forthese services, the RFP would not be released earlier than Spring of 2009. The dataprovided below is for information purposes only and should be revalidated for proposalpurposes if an RFP is released in the future. If you do not see a question that yousubmitted below it was either a duplicate question or we are still drafting a response.Questions not related to the technical requirements were not responded to.1.  Would controlled equipment and supplies include hazardous materials, ordinance orexplosive materials of any kind?      Response: There are no explosives or hazardous waste. Equipment could contain hazardousmaterials.  It may include nominal firearms. 2.	 Might there be any scope limitations such as restricted access to certaincontrolled inventory or supplies that would require Government clearances as part of theNational Industrial Security Program?Response: Access to the identified equipment inventory will be provided.  Access to somefacilities will require an escort which will be provided.  Clearances - proof ofcitizenship will be required to enter the Center.  3.	 Are inventory levels a composite of both, controlled equipment and supplies? Response:  No, the amount of property to be inventoried (as provided in the RFI) areequipment items and do not include supplies.   4.	 Are containers or boxes of items counted as one item in the estimated inventoryamounts (provided in the RFI & spreadsheet), or could containers/boxes contain multipleitems that need to be counted (e.g. a Bin of items or a Lot of items, etc.)?       Response: Typically a single item is marked with an Equipment Control Number (ECN).  Itis however, possible that tagged items could be included in a box of like items if storedin a warehouse.  5.	 As stated, we would have to provide transportation between locations containingproperty inventory.  Would we need (or have to furnish) special equipment to perform theinventory inspection(s), such as forklifts or other equipment?	If so, could theGovernment furnish that?   Response: Government assistance will be provided to attain access to equipment to beinventoried.  6.	Do the provided equipment estimates for each location include supplies?    Response: The RFI identified the number of equipment items to be inventoried. Noadditional inventory efforts are required for supplies.  a.	 If so, can you differentiate the approximate quantities of supplies versuscontrolled equipment as there is a significant difference in the time it takes toinventory each? b.	If supplies are not included, can you estimate the approximate number expected ateach location?7.	 Page 2, paragraph 5 states the second objective would include identification,tagging and reporting of all uncontrolled equipment which otherwise meets the criteriafor control specified in NASA Policy Requirement 4200.1F.     Response: This would include any item "Found On Station" (FOS) during a standardinventory.  This is a standard inventory accounting situation where items are identifiedand tagged that may have entered a facility without the proper controls. a.	 Can NASA provide an estimated quantity of uncontrolled equipment at eachlocation?Response: Last year 436 items were FOS across the Agency.  It happens as a result of ananomaly when property enters the Center without any control. 8.	Is NASA requiring that the contractor manually fill out and submit NASA Form 1618for each piece of equipment that is inventoried?  Response: The NASA Form 1618 is a Found on Station form - For this situation thecoordination with the Property custodian for the area/property would be required to addthe item to the inventory. a.	 If not, what specific data elements will the contractor need to capture for allequipment?Response: The contractor will be given access to NASA's equipment management system (NASAProperty - SAP). 9.	Page 4, Enclosure 1: Annual Inventory Report states that the contractor needs toprovide the Number and value of items added to the records as a result of the inventory. a.	 Is there an expectation that the contractor will appraise new items added to theinventory to attain the value?Response: No - during the inventory when items are added the contractor would coordinatewith the Government site representative.10. Will NASA allow the implementation of new RFID technology during the initial benchmark inventories that will be designed to improve efficiencies in subsequent counts?  Response: We have an Equipment control number that is a bar-code type mechanism.  RFIDtechnology would be an enhanced system but implementation cost might precludeincorporation.	For this effort assume no.  11. Will the contractor have access to the new NPROP system which has a critical impactto the custodial accuracy of the property management module in SAP? Response: Yes.12. What are the anticipated approval processes as well as the input methods that will beused to facilitate record changes?  Will they be linked to the survey process?  Response: Losses will be identified in the NPROP system - coordination with theGovernment representative will be required. Losses will be linked to the survey process.   13. By automatic correction is this meant that the contractor will drive data uploads tothe SAP data base or will this be accomplished manually but as an automatic response toan inventory finding?  Response: Equipment status/losses will be identified directly in the NPROP system -coordination with the Government representative will be required for initial access.   14. The plans for each center will vary greatly depending on the geographic size of thecampus, distribution of asset types and prior culture and effectiveness of equipmentmanagement.  With this in mind will this activity be driven by guidelines in NPR 4200.2B?In particular, sites that have taken advantage of paragraph 4.4.1 which allowed foralternate inventory methods will fare worse than those who have conducted true wall towall and floor to ceiling counts.  Response: Governing guidance is in accordance with: NPD- 4200.1B - Equipment Management NPR- 4200.1F - NASA Equipment Management Procedural Requirements NPR- 4200.2B - Equipment Management manual for Property Custodians 15. The RFI states Work with the NASA Center Supply and Equipment Managers (SEMO) tocoordinate the inventory and resolve discrepancies. This statement may present some veryserious challenges.  As the historic execution of triennial and biennial wall to wallinventories have been conducted with subtle but substantially different techniques ateach center, this coordination could be significantly different at each center. The culture of equipment management is different for virtually every center.  What willbe the contractors expected level of effort in regards to the following: a. Coordination with local custodians and users to assure proper preparation of inventoryactivities.  Aside from interrupting critical mission activities, this level of activitywill often require human resources at each center below the custodial level and into theuser domain?Response: As required. Especially for losses and found on station items.   b. Will the contractor be allowed to conduct pre-inventory sampling counts to assess     or statistically predict, at the Center, Directorate or even organizational level,	     how efficient and accurate result will be? Response: Not for the RFI responses.   c. In light of the fiscal value of the end results, will there be an agency levelindividual assigned to the task that can, if needed assist with local issues and haveagency level decision making capabilities? Response: Yes. NASA HQ Logistics Management Division   d. Will the contractor be responsible for the reports of survey and if so will there be an agency level interaction with this process?	We must consider in some cases the legal, personnel and possibly criminal disclosures that may arise.Response: Yes. To the point of documenting the situation surrounding the loss. TheGovernment is ultimately responsible for the process.	e. In the area of contractor held government equipment, will the effort require access toother company sensitive areas or even proprietary activities? Response: Not anticipated.  16. Some Centers have scores of buildings and various levels of custodial accuracy inmultiple directorates. Can this minimum advanced notice be reduce to 15 days to allow forcontingencies that would otherwise make the inventory schedule a perpetually movingtarget?   Response: Potentially.	However, the schedule for the Center should include the plannedbuildings to be inventoried based on the magnitude of property located in each facility.  17. Will the initial year of the contract be a development phase?  Thus giving thecontractor an opportunity to gauge cultures, physical plant layout, and other criticalinformation that will allow for accurate estimates in the project management arena.  Response: No the initial year is not a development phase.   18. At each center, the local logistics team will play critical roles in capturing loandata, custodial information, disposal patterns, receiving processes, found on stationissues and data accuracy.  Will these organizations be tasked to support this effort andif so at what level? Response: The SEMO will be the primary focal point for Center inventories. 19. Is the equipment labeled with a bar code and do you have software that theinformation would be downloaded to showing what should be there vs what is there?Response: Yes the equipment to be inventoried  has a NASA generated Equipment ControlNumber (ECN)  which is equivalent to a bar code label.	Yes our systems identify locationof property. Yes contractors would be required to UPDATE this Government system withrevised location data.  20. Is the equipment spread out over a wide area or confined to a few buildings?Response:  The equipment is spread across multiple buildings across a wide area at eachCenter. 21. Will someone from the facility be assigned to work with the team in locating theequipment to be scanned?Response: Yes - Access to our NASA facilities requires an escort into our propertylocations.    22. What is the length of time for completing all facilities?  Could a team start at onefacility and move on to the other facilities utilizing one team that would becomefamiliar with the equipment to be scanned therefore probably eliminating a lot ofcounting problems. Response:The time for completing a survey of facilities at a single NASA Center willlikely be dependent upon the amount of property to be inventoried. The number of items to be inventoried perCenter was provided in the RFI.

The Main Engine Cylinder is a critical component of the MARK 7 Mod3 Arresting Engine.  The cylinder contains a ram and is filled with hydraulic fluid and on an arrestment of aircraft forces the fluid through the Constant run out Valve(CRO) into the Accumulator Cylinder.  The Accumulator Cylinder separates hydraulic air and hydraulic fluid by means of a floating piston.  The action of this floating piston causes the run out of the crosshead assembly connected by a series of arrestment cables that ultimately halts the movement of an aircraft landing on the carrier deck. Due to the critical nature of both these units, First Article units are required.  Inspection & Acceptance will be at Source.  Delivery of the First Article units shall be 180 days after contract award.  Delivery of Production units shall be 30 days from Acceptance of the First Article units.  Packing and Packaging shall be Best Commercial Practice that assures no damage to subject details in shipment. A Pre-Award Survey and Post Award Survey with NAVAIR Quality Assurance(QA) participation are anticipated.  Quality Assurance Letter of Instruction is required.  A Higher Level Quality program per FAR 52.246-11 and a Standard Quality program per FAR 52.246-2 are required.  NAVAIR option to witness final inspection and NAVAIR specified Quality Conformance Inspection plan with sampling rates is required.  A Certificate of  Quality Compliance is to be provided by the contractor.  The contractor shall demonstrate and/or perform First Article testing as specified in the drawings and the REIs for both cylinder assemblies in addition to the Contract Data Requirements List for both First Article Testing and the Certificate of Quality Compliance. Award will be based on Best Value.
The drawings involved are Export Controlled.  All requests for copies of these drawings must contain a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.  To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800)352-3572 or www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.him.

<DESC>Office of Naval Research (ONR)Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)for Payload Implosion and Platform Damage Prediction and Validation Implosion is the sudden inward collapse of a pressure resistant structure. For example, a submerged pressure housing with an internal pressure well below the ambient sea pressure may fail due to the external pressure. Following the collapse, a strong pressure wave is radiated into the surrounding fluid. This pressure wave depends sensitively on the exact form of the collapse. The resulting energetic pressure pulse can potentially damage nearby structures. The Navy requires an improved capability to design and qualify submarine external payloads for implosion avoidance and platform survivability. Validated, user-friendly tools are required that enable the designer to predict implosion effects, especially the magnitude of the resulting shock waves: In particular, the Navy needs 1) a parametric payload design tool for conventional payloads, and 2) a physics-based model for complex analyses. This requires both algorithm and software development, and carefully controlled measurements to validate the software.

<DESC>  1. This notice is the second of three Notices made pursuant to FAR 5.205(b) indicating The Department of Homeland Security's intent to continue to sponsor a studies and analysis Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The typical role of the proposed FFRDC is to help DHS address its most critical issues by providing independent and objective analyses for strategic resource & support planning particularly in those areas that cut across multiple operating components of the Department, operational assessments including operational test & evaluation support, systems evaluations to include development of measurable performance metrics, and technology evaluations.
 2. By The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296, as amended) Section 305, Congress authorized DHS to establish one or more FFRDCs to assist DHS in formulating and addressing important homeland security issues, particularly those where scientific, technical, and analytical expertise is involved. 
 3. DHS will be the ultimate sponsor of this studies and analyses FFRDC; however, the Science and Technology Directorate (DHS (S&T)) should be viewed as its primary sponsor. In general, the DHS (S&T) will provide technical quality, business, financial and contractual oversight. The studies and analysis FFRDC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the studies and analysis  FFRDC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the studies and analysis  FFRDC for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS (S&T). 
 4. The studies and analysis  FFRDC Contractor shall provide all required and necessary space, equipment, support and technical personnel (except that as may be Government furnished) to establish, set up and manage the studies and analysis FFRDC. Performance of the studies and analysis  FFRDC management function required under the contract will take place in the Washington DC metropolitan areas, with the exception of assignees to field operations. 
 5. The work to be performed under this contract will involve access to, handling of, and generation of classified information up to, and including, Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). 
 6. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of functions, including:    
&#61607;	Provide independent analysis about the Nation’s vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of systems deployed to make the Nation safer; 
&#61607;	Provide intra-departmental and inter-agency cross-cutting, risk-informed analysis of alternative resource approaches; 
&#61607;	Develop and deploy analytical tools and techniques to evaluate system alternatives (e.g., policy-operations-technology tradeoffs, etc.), and life-cycle costs that have broad application across the Department;
&#61607;	Development of measurable performance metrics, models, and simulations for determining progress in securing the homeland; 
&#61607;	Provide independent and objective operational test and evaluation analysis support for major acquisition programs;
&#61607;	Develop recommendations for guidance on the best practices for standards, particularly to improve the inter-operability of first responders; 
&#61607;	Assessments of technologies and evaluations of technology test-beds for accurate simulation of operational conditions; 
&#61607;	Support critical thinking about the DHS enterprise and develop analytic tools that can be applied consistently across Department programs; 
&#61607;	Support institutional memory through changes in leadership and organizational structure likely in the standing up of a new Department;
&#61607;	Support system of systems integration that contribute to a larger DHS intra-agency and inter-agency enterprise as well as collaboration with state, local tribal governments, the business sector (for-profit and not-for-profits), academia and the public; 
&#61607;	Provide independent development evaluation and audit support for major programs, including: performance metrics, evaluation criteria, product quality assurance/control, development verification and validation studies at the system and system-of-system level; 
&#61607;	Provide recommendations for standards for top-level Homeland Security systems requirements and performance metrics best practices for an integrated DHS approach to systems solutions; 
&#61607;	Understand key homeland security organizations and their specific role and major acquisition requirements.
 
The intent of the studies and analysis FFRDC is to provide long-term, independent and objective advice to the government, using technical talent that is generally not available inside the government.  The studies and analysis FFRDC will provide support to all major DHS components in an integrative and cross-cutting manner, with other DHS FFRDCs, so that over time DHS’s FFRDCs will provide greater synergy, best practices, and lessons learned in relevant areas.  The studies and analysis  FFRDC will operate in a manner that is free of real and perceived conflicts of interest through the rigorous application of corporate firewalls and personnel conflict of interest and non-disclosure agreements approved by the DHS. Corporate entities that operate the DHS National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures center (NBACC) or receive an award to operate the proposed DHS FFRDC for system engineering and development institute (SEDI) shall not be eligible to operate the studies and analysis  FFRDC, so that the DHS FFRDCs may be used to provide independent and objective cross validation as necessary.
 7. This studies and analysis FFRDC contract has an anticipated award date on or about December 2008.  It is anticipated that the studies and analysis  FFRDC will be provided approximately $10M in annual "core" funding but will subsist primarily on task orders from the major DHS operating components. The annual “core” funding shall be used to develop an annual research plan to address the most critical issues of the Department --particularly those efforts that require a cross-cutting approach to understand issues and formulate solutions. The studies and analysis  FFRDC workload is anticipated not to exceed 200 Staff-years of technical effort (STE) annually. 
8.  DHS requests comments on this Notice of Intent to Sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for Studies and Analysis.  Any comments should be submitted electronically to s&a_ffrdc@hq.dhs.gov.  Comments must be received on or before September 11, 2008.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.
