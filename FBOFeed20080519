The overspeed governorprovides the fuel control with an N2 speed signal.  Fuel flow is thenmetered to maintain the desired N2 speed plus or minus 50 RPM.  Theoverspeed governor also serves as an override mechanism to reduce fuelflow in case of a power turbine overspeed.  The governor flyweightrotates at a speed proportional to propeller shaft speed.  Movement ofthe flyweight, acting against the force exerted by a speeder spring,positions a servo value.  The compression of the speeder spring ifpresent by the manual selector cam.  The selector cam is positioned ineither takeoff or reverse profile by an external arm connected to thefuel control main ower lever arm through a push rod.  During anoverspeed, flyweight force overcomes the force of the speeder springshifting the servo valve to port servo pressure fuel to the servoposition mechanically repositioning the main metering valve, through therockshaft, reducing fuel flow.Applicable to the T53 EngineNo prior purchase historyTotal Line Item Qty: 11.0000

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">For the Assessment Center component, DEA annually conducts an Assessment Center in which eligible Agent candidates participate in exercises designed to examine a candidate's skills, abilities and knowledge of the job of a Supervisory Special Agent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Assessment Center is continually monitored and upgraded to ensure the skills being assessed are current with DEA's operational mission and to minimize or completely eliminate any adverse impact that the Center's testing mechanism may inadvertently impose.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Once both the PRS and Assessment Center portions of the test are received, they are combined to provide the candidate with a SAPP score in the range of 70 to 100 points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scores of all Agents who participated in a SAPP are used to eventually determine the promotion band.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">DEA's promotion process, among other programs, is based on a job analysis of the GS-1811 series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to have the most accurate and efficient testing mechanism, the content on which it is based must be up-to-date and comprehensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last full job analysis on the Special Agent position was completed in June 2002 and must be revised and updated, as necessary, and incorporated into the assessment center exercises.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This revision of the promotion assessment center process for GS-1811-13 and GS-14 Special Agents will be updated based on "best practice" selection approaches and methodology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The revised process will be implemented operationally, and an evaluation will be conducted to identify areas for future improvements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the contractor shall conduct a new Special Agent job analysis and shall incorporate the findings into the assessment center exercises.</span></p>

Spacing of leave trees may be varied up to 25 percent to leave the most desirable tree as long as the average post thinning trees per acre given.  All cut trees will be moved so no part is within five (5) feet of any part of a live leave tree, or lopped to a depth of one foot or less.  If piling is needed, piles will be no closer than 5 feet from any part of a live tree.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP) began studying home and recreational injuries in the early 1970s and violence prevention in 1983. From these early activities grew a national program to reduce injury, disability, death, and costs associated with injuries outside the workplace. In June 1992, CDC established the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). As the lead federal agency for injury prevention, NCIPC works closely with other federal agencies; national, state, and local organizations; state and local health departments; and research institutions in support of research about causes, risk factors, and preventive measures for injuries outside the workplace. Like diseases, injuries are preventable. CDC's Injury Center uses the same scientific methods to prevent injuries that have been used to prevent disease: carefully describing the problem through surveillance, studying factors that increase or decrease risk for injury, designing and evaluating intervention strategies that target these risk factors, and taking steps to ensure that proven strategies are implemented in communities nationwide. Currently, NCIPC has developed and launched a pilot training course for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) Curriculum: "Forging a More Powerful Relationship." This notice is for market research purposes to determine the availability of potential vendors that can provide six (6) one-day Emergency Medical Services and Public Health training sessions at sites within the continental United States. The primary focus of the training is in the area of injury prevention. The goal of the training is to strengthen collaborative partnerships between EMS and the Public Health community. The objectives of the proposed program are to enable senior and mid-level managers of EMS and the Public Health community at the regional, state and local levels to know the names, contact information, and responsibilities of key players in EMS and Public Health within their communities; to better understand the missions, roles and daily activities of EMS and Public Health, and their respective impact on the communities they serve. Describe ways in which EMS and Public Health services/agencies can support one another and work together to better accomplish both missions with special emphasis on injury prevention. Identify opportunities for enhanced collaboration and next steps for shared action. The core tasks and minimum contractor requirements shall include: 1)Fully schedule, make accomodations, administer and facilitate six (6) one day skill building training sessions for EMS and PH practitioners within the continental U.S. 2) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in event planning and conference support. 3) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in designing and implementing an evaluation protocol. 4) Demonstrate knowledge of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) operational processes. 5) Demonstrate adequate qualified personnel to successfully perform the work activities by the required dates. 6) Demonstrate ability to record meeting minutes and synthesize proceedings to develop reports. 7) identify familiarity with CDC programmatic processes. 8) Provide public health experience in the field of injury control. All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements shall also include: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, business size and status. The NAICS code for this requirement is 813920. Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statement via email to plw9@cdc.gov. The subject line of the email shall be "EMS abd PH Curriculum Training Capability Statement". Capability statements will not be accepted after June 16, 2008.</p>

<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-00691
<RESPDATE>052308
<CONTACT>Megan J Gnall, Email megan.gnall@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) characterizing drug substances based on their aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability.   These properties, in addition to dissolution, control the rate and extent of drug absorption from immediate release, solid oral dosage forms.  According to BCS, drug substances may be categorized as follows:  Highly soluble, highly permeable (Class 1); poorly soluble, highly permeable (Class 2); highly soluble, poorly permeable (Class 3); and poorly soluble, poorly permeable (Class 4).  Currently, an FDA guidance published in August, 2000 (BCS guidance), provides for waiver of in vivo bioequivalence studies for drugs determined to have BCS Class 1 properties, provided they are rapidly dissolving and not NTI drugs.  This approach has allowed the approval of numerous new and generic drugs based on in vitro data alone, with tremendous savings in resources and reduction in unnecessary human testing.  It is believed, with the appropriate testing, that biowaivers may be extended to drugs belonging to BCS Class 3.  Such biowaivers could also result in significant savings to the drug industry and the American health care consumer.     This contract shall evaluate a number of commonly used excipients for possible impact on the permeability and absorption of several BCS Class 3 drugs.  In vitro as well as confirmatory in vivo studies shall be conducted.  The results could support extending biowaivers to drug products in this class. Two or more candidate drugs belonging to BCS Class 3 will be selected.  Test products of each drug will be prepared using different excipients, and different amounts of the same excipient.  In vitro dissolution profiles will obtained for each test product using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm, or Apparatus II at 50 rpm, in 900 mL in each of the following media: 0.1 N HCl or simulated gastric fluid USP without enzymes; a pH 4.5 buffer; and a pH 6.8 buffer (as described in the BCS guidance).    In vivo bioequivalence studies are then conducted using crossover design, with appropriate power, to evaluate the impact of different excipients, and different amounts of excipients, on the permeability and bioavailability of the test products.  The BE studies will involve drug administration to healthy subjects in a clinical setting, and collecting blood samples at timed intervals.  Plasma levels of the test drugs will be measured using validated bioanalytical methodologies.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained using plasma levels, and statistical analyses will be conducted to evaluate bioavailability and bioequivalence.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.

A randomized trial (Phase 2) to determine the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise for patients who have pulmonary hypertension (PH) shall be conducted.  An essential treatment for almost all cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders is aerobic exercise training.  However, fundamental information about the mechanisms underlying exercise training and its benefits is lacking for patients who have PH.  This research study will begin to address this information gap.  

Subjects to be enrolled in the trial will be adults (over the age of 21 years) with a confirmed medical diagnosis of PH who will be recruited from sites throughout the Baltimore/Washington area.   Informed consent will be obtained from those deemed appropriate for participation in the study.  An orientation to the study will be provided to research participants by the contractor.  In addition, a subset of the baseline tests will be performed at this time including: accelerometry based activity, 6-minute walk distance, and a number of quality of life and functional measures.  

Subsequently, each participant will be scheduled for a visit to NIH-RMD.  During this visit, they will undergo review of their medical records and a full examination by an NIH physician to confirm their suitability for the study.  Once suitability for enrollment is confirmed, participants will complete the remaining baseline research tests which will be performed at NIH-Rehabilitation Medicine Department in Bethesda, Maryland.  

Participants will be randomized by scientists at NIH-RMD to one of two treatment groups: 1) aerobic exercise training plus education or 2) education only.  Subjects in the “aerobic exercise training plus education” group will complete exercise training and educational sessions concurrently.  Subjects enrolled in the “education only” group will complete educational sessions first, followed by aerobic exercise training.  

Study participants will receive all of their aerobic exercise training and educational sessions at the contractor’s facility which should be located within a reasonable distance to NIH in Bethesda, Maryland so that participants who are generally medically fragile do not have to travel excessive distances from their homes to participate in the trial.  Aerobic exercise training will consist of a 10-week regimen of supervised treadmill or over ground walking three times a week.  Exercise session duration will be 30 minutes and will progress to 45 minutes per session over the 10 weeks.  The intensity of exercise will be between 70 and 80% of the heart rate reserve.  Educational sessions will be held twice a week for 10 weeks.  Subjects in both arms of the study will participate concurrently however, study sessions for the two groups will be conducted in distinct areas and at separate times.  

The majority of study outcome measures will be assessed at NIH-RMD.  These will include pre- and post-intervention comparisons of treadmill exercise tests to assess heart rate, pulse oximetry, EKG, maximum oxygen consumption, oxygen on-kinetics, bioelectrical impedance cardiography, and near infrared spectroscopy measurements of muscle oxygenation.  In addition, collaborators at the contractor’s facility will assess accelerometry based activity, 6-minute walk distance, and a number of other quality of life and functional measures including: International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Fatigue Severity Scale, SF-36, the Human Activity Profile, Stages of Exercise Adoption Scale, Self-Efficacy, Social Support Questionnaire, and Patient Health Questionnaire.  For subjects in the exercise plus education group, these tests will be conducted before the start of aerobic training and again at the end of 10-weeks of training.  For subjects in the education only group, these tests will be conducted before the start of educational sessions, at the end of 10-weeks of educational sessions, and again at the end of 10-weeks of aerobic training.



Scope / Objective:

This research study initiates a line of research with an overarching goal of formulating exercise rehabilitation guidelines for patients who have PH.  If the effect of exercise therapy is to be fully understood, the factor limiting aerobic metabolism must be identified and its mechanism characterized. This information may have a bearing on the eventual provision of exercise prescriptions guidelines and will help to determine whether a positive exercise training effect occurs by an intervention on the mechanism of limitation or a compensatory effect that offsets the limitation.  This study represents a unique opportunity to assess the effects of exercise on patients with PH and may open up valuable new treatment options for these patients.

In adults who have PH, the specific objectives of the research are to:
1.	examine responses and adaptations to exercise at quantifiable target intensities that correspond to energy expenditure requirements
2.	understand changes in symptom limited and sub-maximal exercise test results, using task-specific and task-similar testing and training modalities
3.	examine the effects of task-specific exercise training on physical activity  
4.	determine the relationships between patient’s ability to achieve and maintain an aerobic steady state and to sustain physical activity
5.	determine the effect of aerobic exercise training on psychosocial and behavioral functioning and other HRQOL components
6.	based on the progression in training volume, delineate the time course of improvement in work capacity across an aerobic exercise training program
7.	explore the relationships among measures of aerobic metabolic function and potential mechanistic factors that may limit oxidative metabolism
8.	examine the relationships among indices of aerobic metabolic function and the mechanisms by which of aerobic exercise training improves oxidative metabolism

&#61607;	The number and % of exercise sessions attended
&#61607;	Amount of time walked at each session
&#61607;	Whether session was comprised of treadmill or over ground
&#61607;	Number of rest intervals that the participant required at each session (if any)
&#61607;	Average heart rate during session 
&#61607;	Data from the pedometers.

6)	Requirement: Maintain communication with NIH-RMD project investigators regarding study related issues.
Outcome: Contractor research study staff will participate in weekly telephone conferences with NIH-RMD project investigators and provide information requested by NIH investigators via a weekly agenda.
 
Option 1: Potential additional study activities during the base period of performance (August 11, 2008 through August 10, 2010)

In order to optimize subject recruitment and participation in this clinical trial, the Government may determine that it is beneficial to extend hours of operation of the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program to perform the scope of work under this contract.  On a quarterly basis, the Government will assess the need for such an extension of hours to maximize potential for recruitment of additional study participants.  

Option 2: Potential additional study activities beyond the base period of performance (August 11, 2008 through August 10, 2010)

It is anticipated that additional study participants may be required.  Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition and it may prove to be more difficult than anticipated to recruit participants that meet the study inclusion criteria and do not possess exclusion criteria.  Also, the level of potential withdrawal from the study is not known with certainty, and additional subjects may need to be enrolled to accommodate this loss.  This option will extend time of study to recruit additional participants with a maximum of 25.  This would extend the period of performance by an additional twelve months.

This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a corporate capability statement to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS Code 622310 with a size standard of $31.5  million dollars. All respondents are requested to identify their firm’s size and type of business.

Interested firms responding to this source sought should adhere to the following:

a. Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government’s requirements as described above. The capability statement should contain sufficient enough detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities.

b.  The capability statement should include past performance references, descriptions of key personnel capabilities and any other information deemed relevant which clearly demonstrates your ability to conduct the Phase 2 Clinical trial as described above.

<DESC>1.  SCOPE.  Background:  The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to equip operational commanders with Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and Government off the Shelf (GOTS) solutions in order to increase effectiveness and reduce risk. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders setting forth necessary capabilities.  The REF is charted by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>	1.1  Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq require small contingents of Soldiers to be located at Joint Security Stations (JSS) and Combat Outposts (COPs) away from the main logistical support.  Although mission essential requirements of food water, ammunition, fuel are met by Service,  forces, power is often foraged off the local economy or provided in an ad hoc manner via the local power grid or ad hoc generators of various types cobbled together.  Military Table of  Organization and Equipment (MTOE) Power requirements previously limited to the battalion level of organization are now required at the company level.

<DESC>The Central Texas Veterans Health Care System located in Temple, Texas is seeking to award a contract for transportation services. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR QUOTES OR PROPOSALS AS FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED OR AUTHORIZED TO PAY FOR VENDOR QUOTES OR PROPOSALS FOR THIS CURRENT NEED.The contract will be for transportation of two mobile units.  One mobile unit will house a portable MRI for use in research projects and the other mobile unit will house administrative offices for use in support of the research projects conducted by the Mobile MRI Unit.  Each unit is placed upon trailers whereby only a tractor will be needed to transport the units.  Both units will be transported between the Center of Excellence, located in Waco, TX and the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System located in Temple, TX and Darnall Army Medical Center located in Fort Hood, TX.  The current schedule is unknown as the schedule is to be determined at a later date.  However, the Government will give at least seventy two (72) hours notice prior to any transportation request.  The Government will also negotiate with the vendor an appropriate time frame for all cancellations based upon normal commercial practices and procedures.  The Government is seeking to award a contract that is either per load or per hour firm fixed price.  If an economic price adjustment is standard commercial practice, the Government will accept a proposed economic price adjustment within the vendors original quote.  However, the Government reserves the right to review and negotiate all pricing proposed, including the percentage of economic price adjustment.   The Government will not pay for services not rendered.  Although there is not a current schedule determined, the Government is expecting that the mobile units will be transported between the locations at least once a month, to and from one location to another, for example, Waco to Temple.Quotes will be reviewed based upon price and past performance.  If references are available, please provide.  Note that vendors will not be penalized if references are not available, however they are preferred and will be used to determine past performance.  For example, if there are two quotes for the same price, the Government will base its decision on past performance.  Please contact Jennifer Salerno-Diciuccio either via phone at 254-743-2113 or e-mail at Jennifer.salerno-diciuccio@va.gov.  The formal RFQ will be furnished upon request to any vendor with capability to perform the contract.  The formal RFQ contains specific dimensional and weight information on the mobile units that will need transport between Government sites.

Following the evaluation of available commercial software products, cost, and system requirements, NIH selected NMS Imaging (formally National Micrographics Systems), 11941 Bournefield Way, Silver Spring, MD 20904 to provide its commercial products (including proprietary support services) as the software platform for both NIH enterprise systems.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) is issuing a prospectus under which multiple concession contracts may be awarded for the operation of cruise ship services within Glacier Bay National Park.  The contracts will include the initial allocation of a limited number of vessel use days in Glacier Bay proper during June through August of each year of the contract term.  The anticipated term of the contracts will be January 1, 2010 - September 30, 2019.
The solicitation, selection and award of the concession contracts will be conducted pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51.  In addition, Holland America Line, Inc. and Princess Cruises, Inc. are historical operators, based on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Section 134, eligible to be awarded contracts for their historical (prior to January 1, 1979) level of use (39 and 32 vessel use days in June through August, respectively).  Therefore, the NPS intends to award concession contracts to these operators for that level of use, pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Section 1307 (16 USC 3197) and 36 CFR 13.310.  Generally, historical operators have a right to continue to provide the same kind and level of service that they were legally engaged in providing prior to January 1, 1979.  The two companies can also compete for additional use days for the June through August period. 
The prospectus is available on the Glacier Bay website at: <http://www.nps.gov/glba/parkmgmt/cruise-ships.htm>.  Hardcopies are available upon request.  If you are planning to submit a proposal, we recommend that you advise the park of your interest and provide a contact person, e-mail address and telephone number.  Those who have requested hard copies or advised the park of their interest will be placed on the mailing list to receive (via e-mail) any updates, amendments to the prospectus, and questions received and answers provided by the NPS which may be issued during the response period.  This information will also be posted on the website listed above. 
Proposals must be received at National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, 240 West 5th Avenue, Room 114, Anchorage, Alaska 99501-2327, no later than 4:00 p.m. on August 18, 2008                in order to be considered and evaluated.  Requests for the prospectus and other inquiries may be made to David Nemeth, Glacier Bay National & Preserve, PO Box 140, Gustavus, Alaska 99826, phone 907 697-2624, or e-mail David_Nemeth@nps.gov.  
The opportunity to apply for cruise ship vessel services into Glacier Bay National Park shall remain open throughout the contract term. However, it is expected that all of the available use-days for June through August of each year will be awarded during the initial allocation to companies who submit proposals by the time and date referenced above.  This "open" solicitation will allow additional Cruise Ship operators to submit proposals to provide services in the under-utilized shoulder and off-season and will allow additional operators an opportunity to utilize prime season use-days which may become available over the course of the contract term.

<SUBJECT>Coalition Warrior Interoperability  Demonstration (CWID) 2009
<SOLNBR>CWID2009
<RESPDATE>091508
<CONTACT>Nehemiah G Jackson II, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-681-0256, Fax 703-681-0521, Email nehemiah.jackson@disa.mil
<DESC>Description
1. This announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2009 (CWID 2009) scheduled for 3 June 2009 – 26 June 2009. Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States (U.S.) must submit all Trial proposals for CWID by 15 September 2008. Industry partners must have a C/S/A or non-DoD government agency acting as a sponsor to submit a trial. Complete CWID program details, to include references and submission instructions for trials, are found at http://www.cwid.js.mil.
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event enabling the C/S/As, and the multinational community to identify, investigate, and assess command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions which focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing Coalition, COCOM, Service, Agency (C/C/S/A) interoperability and information sharing while exploring new partnerships. U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), on behalf of the Chairman, is responsible for the oversight of the CWID program.  CWID focuses on net-centric solutions to current C4ISR capability gaps that the traditional DoD acquisition process is not adequately addressing.  Gaps are identified in the annual CWID objectives and reflect immediate and near term  capability needs.  C/S/A’s and industry partners can nominate/submit potential technology solutions to be demonstrated at CWID to address specific acquisition program objectives.  Each proposed technology demonstration is called a “trial.”  CWID provides Technical/Interoperability, Warfighter/Operator, and Information Assurance assessments on trials submitted within the construct of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System.  C/S/As are highly encouraged to explore solutions to broad interoperability challenges between participating services, agencies and international participants during the CWID 2009 event. CWID is also an appropriate venue for spiral development, risk reduction, or validation of fielded/near-fielded commercial and/or DoD systems when appropriate to reduce development/demonstration costs or production timelines.
3. USJFCOM is the host COCOM for CWID 2009 and influences the simulated operational scenario to address the range of C/C/S/A challenges.  The scenario focuses on exercising military coalition task force (CTF) responsibilities in conjunction with U.S. Northern Command’s (USNORTHCOM) Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HS/HD) initiatives, and increasing/enhancing involvement, integration, and interoperability with our coalition partners. Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID 2009 and the anticipated international participants include: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO.  COCOMs may invite nations, with prior Joint Staff approval, from within their respective AOR to participate as CTF members.  USNORTHCOM’s coalition partners include US and Canadian military, government and civil agencies (e.g., Department of Homeland Security, Canada Command, and Public Safety Emergency Preparedness Canada).
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for the assessing of C4ISR solutions.  Trials may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Information Assurance assessment.  Trials must address one or more of the provided objectives and specifically, focus on at least one narrowly defined sub-objective.  The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG) selects and prioritizes trials based on inputs from the CWID Assessment Working Group (AWG), Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG) and the Trial Transition Information Working Group (T2IWG).  Performance results captured during the execution phase assessments are documented in the CWID 2009 Final Report. 
5. As stated above, each proposed trial must address one or more of the CWID objectives and corresponding sub-objectives listed in paragraph 7 to be selected for participation and must commit to provide the funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, and documentation necessary to participate at one or more execution sites.  The CWID SMG will select trial proposals on how well the trial’s proposal satisfies the chosen objectives and corresponding sub-objectives. The selection criteria are specified in the CWID Additional Information document.  Trials must have a DoD or government sponsor in the format outlined on the CWID web site.  
6. Trial information is transmitted across the Combined Federated Battle Lab Network (CFBLNet), a worldwide secure network, enabling classified, releasable data to be exchanged among the CFBLNet participants.  The CWID JMO coordinates, engineers, and supervises the network and the information domains for the worldwide venue.  The CWID 2009 hardware and software trials must support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct.  The CFBLNet, which supports military and coalition operations, provides the infrastructure to facilitate the military’s role in providing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). 
7. The 2009 Objectives, initiated by USJFCOM, are supported by sub-objectives that reference clearly defined C/C/S/A capability gaps.  The objectives are linked to COCOM Integrated Priority Lists, DoD Joint Capability Areas, the USJFCOM Transformation Roadmap, USJFCOM C2 Capability Portfolio Management (C2 CPM) initiative and other coalition, service requirements and Joint Staff source documentation.  The objectives reflect the following recurring themes:
a.	Investigate and identify emerging and relevant coalition information sharing solutions,     
b.	Focus on demonstrating interoperability solutions for C/C/S/A capability gaps and challenges, and
c.	Enhance multinational, Joint, and inter-agency cooperation and communication capabilities.

The CWID 2009 Objectives and their associated sub-objectives represent process improvements to facilitate post-CWID execution efforts that facilitate strategies aimed at responsibly bringing technology solutions to the DoD and Federal acquisition communities for consideration.   Multinational (to include DoD and non-DoD entities) information sharing solutions should be built on a foundation that is web-enabled, net-centric, secure, scalable, and bandwidth sensitive.

<p>Justification for Brand Name Only: These items are required to replace software and hardware modules currently in place. A recent increase in DLA workload has mandated a more efficiant method of processing the metrology related projects. Without the acquisition of this material, a Work Stoppage Condition will occur within the Metrology Laboratory. These CMM's require immediate upgrades in order to perform current and projected term organizational workloads. New software and hardware modules have recently become available which will allow up to refit/upgrade the CMM's rather than incur the immense cost of purchasing new CMM's. The equipment supports 402 MXW operations, DLA First Article Program, AFMC Special Projects, and Weapons Systems managed by WR-ALC. Additionally, the CMM's utilize software and hardware modules which are written/manufactured and licensed by the manufacturer of the CMM's. These materials involove proprietary rights and no other source has the rights to produce or market them.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined/synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in the notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation reference number is F3ZT908079A001; this solicitation is a request for quotation.

Offeror must quote cost of total requirement by breaking out labor cost which is part of the total cost.</p>
<p>FOB is Travis Air Force Base. The following provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition. Offerors must comply with all instruction contained in FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offers-Commercial. FAR 52.212-2-Evaluation-Items paragraph (a) to this provision is completed as follows: EVALUATION CRITERIA: The Government will award the contract resulting form the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirement will be the most advantageous to the Government, past performance and price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. PAST PERFORMANCE 2. PRICE Past Performance is significantly more important than price when being evaluated. Provide up to three (3) sources (list Government source/s if available) as a reference of the most recent and *relevant past and present contracts performed within the last three (3) years. The Government will contact those sources provided by the offeror with a past performance survey.</p>
<p>(1) Furnish the following information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Company/division name<br />b. Product/service<br />c. Contracting agency<br />d. Contract number<br />e. Contract dollar value<br />f. Period of Performance<br />g. Name, address, email address, FAX number, and telephone number of the Contracting Officer and Functional Area Chief.<br />h. Comments regarding compliance with the contract terms and conditions.<br />i. Comments regarding any known performance deemed not acceptable to the customer or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance Survey: The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirement. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror's sources to assess past and present performance.<br /><br />*Relevancy definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Very Relevant Present/past performance efforts involving the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially the same as this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance efforts involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, than this solicitation requires.<br />Semi-Relevant Present/past performance contractual efforts involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, than this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Did not involve any significant aspects of above<br /><br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each, if applicable.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving the requirement that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "High Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the requirement, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little Confidence, or No Confidence, as defined in AFFARS MP5315.3, Table 3. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in the requirement.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

I.	Background
The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the regulation of ocean borne transportation in the foreign commerce of the United States.  The FMC administers the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by Public Law 105-258 (The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998), Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 and Public Law No. 89-777.  All of these statutes were amended and modified by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which took effect on May 1, 1999.  To achieve its statutory mandates, the FMC relies on technology to support its mission.

II. 	Objectives and Scope
The objective is to obtain a COOP site to host hot back-ups of all FMC databases and to manage the FMC offsite backup tape storage.  
  
III. 	Deliverables
COOP Site
The FMC needs a secure site with no public access.  The site must also be independently certified in writing by a licensed Professional Engineer (“PE”) who is also a qualified Blast Engineer/Consultant as having been designed to meet the Level C or higher design criteria for physical security protection for leased spaces in new federal office buildings and major modernization projects, as published by the Interagency Security Committee of the General Services Administration, edition 2003 or later.  A qualified Blast Engineer/Consultant is (i) a licensed PE with a minimum of 10 years of demonstrated experience in the design and assessment of similar facilities subjected to blast loads, such as Federal Courthouse and US Embassies, (ii) included in the BMAG list of blast consulting firms (https://bmag.usace.army.mil) and (iii) in possession of and has been approved to retain the full version of the ISC blast criteria. 

The COOP site must be located at least 25 miles, but no more than 50 miles, from the FMC headquarters in Washington, DC.

The COOP site must also provide the ability to allow select FMC personnel access to the equipment seven days a week, Monday through Sunday, from 7:00am to 6:00pm.  The  access will be coordinated with the facility prior to the visit.

Due to the sensitivity of the data within the databases, the FMC requires a secure environment in which only FMC personnel will maintain the systems.  

The FMC requires the following:
	One Half (1/2) rack of 24 “U”s
	10/100 Internet Connection
	10/100 Management Ethernet Connection
	Basic Monitoring
	Remote Power Control at the Plug Level
	Power allocations via redundant feeds
	IP Addressing
	Dual isolated power feeds to the rack level

The FMC will provide and install the servers, switch, and firewall.  FMC personnel are solely responsible for the installation and the maintenance of the FMC owned equipment as follows.  
5 – DeLL  PowerEdge 2950 with dual Power Supplies. AC configuration with standard redundant 750W hot-plug auto-switching universal 110/220V AC power supplies

1 – DELL Powervault 220s with Dual Power Supplies.  488 W maximum continuous; 550 W peak,   Heat dissipation 200 W;   Voltage 100-240 V rated AC Power Supplies

1 – HP 2650 Switch.  AC voltage: 100 – 127 / 200 – 240 volts.  Maximum current: 16 A / 8 A.

1 – Juniper SSG5 Firewall.  Power supply (AC) 100-240 VAC 100-240 VAC.  Maximum thermal output 122.8 BTU/Hour 122.8 BTU/Hour

Off-site Back-up Tape Storage
Off-site data storage in tape storage facilities certified to GSA standards (AA-V-2737) of up to 300 cartridges.  
Includes one weekly round trip pickup and delivery approximately 7 LTO tapes in contractor owned vehicles by drivers with a minimum security clearance level of secret.

The FMC anticipates that it will require 4 emergency pickups per year.

IV.	Period of Performance
June 15, 2008 through June 14, 2009

V.	Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
The Government will periodically evaluate the Contractor’s performance in accordance with the QASP. The purpose of the QASP is to ensure reliable, uninterrupted services are provided in accordance with the PWS.  The plan ensures unnecessary complaints and acceptable performance.

The Government’s QASP includes the following elements:
§	Periodic inspection of the Contractor’s work
§	Progress meetings with the Contractor

Methods of Surveillance:
Random Evaluation: This method employs a “spot check” style of evaluation and may be adjusted, based on quality and/or productivity trends.  The Government retains the right to inspect all requirements of the contract. Unacceptable performance will be recorded and the Contractor shall be required to correct the unacceptable condition within a 24-hour time period.  If the Contractor does not correct the unacceptable condition within 24-hours, the COTR will notify the Contracting Officer who will take appropriate administrative action for unacceptable performance.



PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY (PRS)

A PRS table will be added to the award for each task listed in the PWS.  
		Acceptable Quality Level – 100%
		Evaluation Method – Random Sampling. See QASP
		Incentive/Disincentive – Performance Rating

The 7500cx Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) will provide FDA scientists an instrument capable of quantifying levels of heavy metals specified in regulations for color additives.  The equipment must have the following specifications: (1) Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) System must be compatible with current systems in place at FDA and in field laboratories in order to be applicable to methods in use. The system must be able to operate with ChemStation software.  (2)	The sample introduction system must be a 3-channel computer controlled peristaltic pump for pumping of sample, internal standard and spray chamber drain, and include a thermoelectrically controlled quartz spray chamber with low-uptake concentric nebulizer. (3)The collision/reaction cell must be able to operate in collision mode using pure He to remove  isobaric polyatomic interferences in complex unknown samples using a single set of cell conditions.  (4)The instrument should be delivered with all necessary supplies and accessories required for the installation and start-up. The installation and training must be included. (5)	As a laboratory which routinely analyzes samples with varying matrices and high salt content, the ICP-MS must have the capability of performing semi-quantitative analysis of all elements in a single 60 sec scan.  This scan must provide accurate determinations of all elements without the need for interference correction equations to correct for interfering polyatomic species.  In particular, As, Cr, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn each suffer from well-documented plasma- or matrix-based polyatomic interferences.  The ICP-MS must be capable of analyzing all interference-prone elements on-mass.  Specifically, the instruments must analyze arsenic at mass 75 in variable high matrix samples without the use of interference equations.  Published papers or application notes should be available which demonstrate accuracy of As measurements in variable high-matrix samples, using mass 75 without interference correction equations.
(6)The system must include the capability of adding an optional High Matrix interface with the capability of nebulizing percent levels of dissolved solids.  For example, undiluted seawater.  (7)The system must have a quadrupole mass filter with hyperbolic profile cross-section rods, producing an ideal true hyperbolic field. The quadrupole must be able to operate at a minimum frequency of 3MHz for optimum resolution of overlapping major and minor matrix peaks.  (8)Torch position should be fully computer controlled and auto-tunable in all three axes. The movement in each axis should be independent of other two. Torch position and reproducibility should be 0.1mm in all three axes. Computer readout of torch position is required for method and data audit purposes. (9)To minimize downtime due to routine maintenance, to protect the mass analyzer and detector from contamination with atmospheric moisture and to extend the life of the detector; the main off axis ion lens assembly must be located outside the main vacuum system to allow for removal, cleaning and replacement without the need to open the main vacuum system. (10)Maintenance of the ion lenses must not require a service call.
(11)To minimize matrix effect caused by high salt levels in samples, the RF generator should operate at 27.12 MHz and have a continuous output power variable from 500 to 1600 watts.  (12)In order to minimize laboratory temperature changes, the spray chamber must be thermoelectrically cooled.  The cooling device must be fully integrated to the mainframe, computer controlled and monitored.  (13)In order to overcome the variability in Cl concentration, the ICP-MS must be able to remove ClO and ArCl interferences on V and As in cell mode without the need for interference equations.  Published papers or application notes must be available which demonstrate the ability of the proposed instrument to perform trace determinations of V and As in a Cl matrix, using collision-cell mode without the need for interference correction equations. (14)The system must show its capability by measuring elements like Na, K, Ca Mg and Fe at concentrations higher than 1,000ppm and elements like Zn, Cu, Mn, Be and Hg at low ppt levels using the standard sample introduction system and standard interface without adjusting quadrupole resolution to reduce sensitivity. (15)Data must be displayed in real time to monitor transient signals generated on analytical runs.  Partial runs must be saved and available for data analysis even if the analytical run is manually stopped.  (16)The fast transient signals analyzed will include the study of all major elements and traces in small samples.  In order to achieve this we require a system capable of a linear dynamic range of nine (9) orders of magnitude.   Supporting documentation must be available to substantiate nine orders of linear dynamic range. (17)The system must use the same interface cones for both high sensitivity and high-matrix applications. It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov. The provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition. Offerors should complete their representations and certifications at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. The Food and Drug Administration requests responses from qualified sources capable of provided these services in accordance with the statement of work. FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items applies. All offers will be evaluated on technical factors and price with technical being more important than price. Technical factors will be on how the services conform to the statement of work. FAR Provision, 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications applies, if the contractor is not registered in ORCA, the vendor shall complete and submit with offer. FAR Clauses 52.212-4 and 52.212-5 apply.

<DESC>The ThinPrep 2000 Processor is an automated slide preparation unit used with the ThinPrep Pap Test for cervical cancer screening and for non-gynecological specimens such as for the diagnosis of cancers of the lung, bladder, and gastrointestinal tract.  The processor uses a membrane technology that controls dispersion, collection and transfer of diagnostic cells from the sample to the slide.  This ensures that the slide is representative and reproducible of the original sample collected in the vial.  Because the supplies for this processor such as the sample vial, filters and processing fluids are manufactured specifically for use in conjunction with the controlled membrane transfer technology developed by Cytyc, only their supplies can be used with this processor.

<DESC>This is a Brand Name Only requirement and a small business set-aside.  NGA has standardized on the HP ProLiant servers.  Maintaining the same hardware architecture minimizes total cost of ownership.  All LAN components within a network need to work with all other components flawlessly.  Any part that is incompatible or malfunctioning will quickly degrade the entire network performance to an unacceptable level.  This complexity and fragility is one reason that NGA must continue to maintain their HP servers.

The period of performance for the warranty is 12 months after the date of award.  Evaluation will be based on lowest price.  See the attachment for the item details.  If you have any questions concerning this correspondence, please contact April Merriwether at April.N.Merriwether@nga.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue an order to Dick Clark Productions, Inc., on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and is for the international television programming broadcast rights.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.
  
This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP).     A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Solicitation/synopsis reference number 216481306255 is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and incorporates the following with the word “quoter” substituted for “offeror”.  

Provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-22 effective 23 NOV 2007. 

	(1)  FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items) (JAN 2005):
		(a)	Re para (a):  NAICS 334220; small business size standard is 750 employees.
		(b)	Note that para (k) requires quoter to be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at time order is issued and throughout performance.

	(2)	FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation – Commercial Items) (JAN 1999) with the following insertion in para (a) “lowest priced technically acceptable quote with acceptable past performance.”  Technical evaluation will be whether quoted items satisfy all requirements in CLIN 0001 description below.

This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  The most common method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  Options within WAWF include a, “stand-alone” invoice and a “combo” that includes both the payment request and the receiving document required to validate the object of the invoice has been received in an acceptable condition.  The experience of this office in the administration of electronic invoices has shown that the use of  the “combo” invoice, when available,  will result in much quicker more accurate payment.  The matching by the WAWF system of invoices and receiving reports individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity routinely cause problems because they do not appear together and must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the “combo” does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . Training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.  

	(3)	QUOTATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED NOT LATER THAN 2:00 PM PACIFIC TIME 27 MAY 2008 IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED.  Quotations may be emailed to allen.powers@dodmedia.osd.mil or sent via fax to (951) 413-2432.    Due to technical issues email and fax may not result in your proposal arriving before the cut-off time, please allow extra time if you’re sending your quote via electronic means.

(4)	Quotations must include completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items) (MAR 2005) with Alt 1 (APR 2002) or indication that reps and certs are in ORCA.

CLIN 0001  – The contractor shall provide the Government with the International Broadcast Rights in support of the American Forces Networks, for the following television programs:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question &amp; Answer</span></strong><br />1. Do you have an anticipated start date for the Part-time Distance Learning Technician?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANSWER: We would like the contractor to start as soon as the contract is awarded. We are willing to work with the contractor to establish a later start date if required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Item C in the SOW, Schedule of Work states that the Technician shall work five days per week, unless modified by the ESO, for approximately five hours per day between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:00 pm. Can we safely assume that the Technician will generally average no less than 25 hours a week or are there frequent circumstances (excluding holidays, base closures, emergencies, etc.) when the technician might average less than 25 hours weekly for an extended period of time?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The standard schedule is five hours a day for five days a week. There is some modest flexibility as to the start time. We want to work with the contractor to find a daily start time that satisfies both the needs of the Learning Center and those of the contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We assume that following contract award the Part-Time Distance Learning Technician will be able to obtain a CAC card to facilitate entry to the base and access to the base computer network?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Previous contractors have been authorized a CAC on the basis of the Learning Center contract. I would expect that to continue. The contractor must have access to the base LAN and that requires a CAC.</p>

<DESC>SSA-RFQ-08-1386 – Amendment 2

The purpose of this amendment is to provide vendor question’s and the Government’s response’s. The amendment will also revise the specifications for line item 1 and 3.

Vendors are reminded they must acknowledge receipt of solicitation amendments in their quote. As a result of this amendment the closing date remains Thursday, May 22, 2008, at 12pm as referenced in Amendment 1. 
	

IMPORTANT  NOTICE TO VENDORS WHO MAY ALREADY HAVE SUBMITTED A QUOTE:  1)  If the information in this amendment does not cause you to have to revise your quote you should send an email to the contract specialist acknowledging receipt of the amendment and include a statement that your original dated quote is unchanged as a result of the amendment; or 2)  If the information in this amendment is cause for you to change your quote you may submit a revised quote CLEARLY marked as “REVISED BASED ON INFORMATION IN AMENDMENT 2” and include a statement that your original quote should not be considered.  

1. Vendor question: 

The spec calls that the faucet should not be for a single cockhole. Does this mean you would like to have the 4” escutcheon plates option priced with the faucets? 

Government response:  

The specification as originally posted was incorrect. The faucet should mount in a SINGLE cockhole only. The specification has been revised to read “the faucet should be for a single cockhole.”  

2. Vendor question: 

Regarding the spec for quantity 300 (daisy chain) connectors:  the connectors look like 3 cables tied into a central hub.  The way I am bidding the faucets one of these assemblies (3 cable one hub) comes with each faucet.  Those cables are enough to link all one hundred faucets.  Do you want this or do you really want 300 additional cable assemblies and hubs? 

Government response:  

Quantity is 300 as specified. The daisy chain connectors link Faucet to Faucet to Faucet to Transformer in series.
 

3. Vendor question: 

For Item #2 on the Solicitation (Connecting Cables), depending on the brand of faucet that is quoted, generally one power supply/transformer will power 6 or 8 faucets.  I just wanted to re-verify that in that case you will need a quantity of 300 [Connecting Cables]. 

Government response:  

See question #2.

4. Vendor question: 

For Item #3 (Water Tubing), is there an acceptable length of the 120’ ft copper tubing that we can ship it?  (i.e. 10’ ft lengths, etc.) 

Government response:  

Nothing shorter than 10’ in length for the copper tubing. 

 
Revised:

REQUIREMENT: ITEM #1- Faucets (Qty. 100) • Must have modular construction with all concealed components above deck. • Double infrared sensors with automatic setup and indicator light. • Automatic self-adapting sensor technology. • Magnetic solenoid valve. • Water supply connections with flexible high pressure hoses and strainer for hot and cold. • 6 volt DC plug-in transformer that could accommodate electrical connections up to 6 faucets. • Should have integral spout mixer. • No pop-up drain. • 5 9/16” from cock hole to aerator outlet. • Height 6 7/8” • The faucet should be for single cock hole.


ITEM #3- Water tubing • 120’ ft type “L” copper ½” (Individual cuts no less than 10’ in length)

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OFDA’s Office of the Director assists the Director and Deputy Director with tracking trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field, recommends strategies for action, and maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors.  
 
INTRODUCTION

Created in 1947 by the United Nations Participation Act, the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN) assists the President and the Department of State (DOS) in conducting United States (U.S.) policy at the United Nations (UN).  An important function of the USUN is to keep the DOS informed of events at the UN.  USUN officers report on meetings and make recommendations to DOS as to what course of action the U.S. should pursue.  This information is also relayed to overseas American Embassies which have an interest in particular items under UN consideration.  The USUN is also a link between the U.S. Government (USG) and the UN Secretariat.  The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) maintains a liaison at the USUN to represent USAID’s views and interests on humanitarian assistance issues and to report to USAID on the proceedings of UN activities.

OBJECTIVE

To assign a Humanitarian Advisor to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (USUN) in New York as the senior advisor and USUN authority on humanitarian affairs.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Humanitarian Advisor serves as an authoritative source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Ambassadors and staff.  He/She will help plan USUN strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively lobby members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaison with the UN Secretariat and the representational offices in New York of UN specialized agencies; negotiate resolutions in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and anticipate and prepare documents, briefing memos and statements for USUN Ambassadors for important meetings and events.

The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area.  The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradicts existing knowledge.

The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues and keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments.

Contacts will be with DOS and USAID employees at all levels, both in New York and Washington, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, congressional staff, experts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations.  The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions.  The Humanitarian Advisor post is organizationally located within OFDA’s Office of the Director while physically located at the USUN offices in New York City.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Fourth set of questions and answers.<BR><BR>1. Were making an assumption that the Proposal Summary sheet (was in the BAA announcement as a separate file but not mentioned in the actual BAA document) has to be completed and included in the submittal.  <BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>This is a Contracting Requirement that must be addressed even though it was not specifically mentioned in the BAA.<BR> <BR>2. Is this Proposal Summary page part of the 15-page limitation or not?  <BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>No, this is over and above.<BR> <BR>3. Is the preference to have the Proposal Summary sheet as a separate file on the CD or incorporated into the White Paper submittal? If in the White Paper submittal do you want it presented before or after the Cover Page?  <BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>Yes separate file for contracting to easily identify.<BR><BR>4. What is the software preference for the files on the CD (i.e. is the White Paper and Quad Chart suppose to be submitted just as a *.doc or is the preference in *.pdf format)?  Realize the Gantt chart will be in *.mpp format.<BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>Preference is for a Microsoft Office Word with the quad chart and the Gantt chart embedded.  However, Gantt chart must also be submitted in MS Project format as a separate *.mpp file.<BR><BR>5. In reviewing the postings for BAA-UAST0002, Unmanned and Autonomous System Testing, a question was asked (Modification 1) about whether the BAA would be interested in the R&D of new SIGINT/COMINT sensors for unmanned systems. The response to this question was yes.<BR><BR>We would like to obtain a clarification of this Q&A as it relates to the BAA's four technical topic areas of interest. Is the BAA potentially interested in developing a SIGINT/COMINT sensor, as prime mission equipment, for intelligence gathering purposes (if so, then which area of interest and capability framework would this interest fall under) or would the interest be in investigating the dual-use of a  SIGINT/COMINT sensor as a platform to also perform the test and evaluation of UAS?<BR><BR>Response: Modeling and Architecture<BR><BR>Refer to the technical topic areas on page 18. In column 3 the BAA describes the types of S&T investments that are needed in UAST.  Without knowing the details of your proposal, we could surmise you are proposing an architectural framework for SIGINT/COMINT.  Therefore, this would lead us to believe that you are primarily addressing modeling and architecture (MA). Even though this may be primarily focused on MA, it could have relationships to other subtopic areas as indicated by the parenthesis references in column 3.  For instance, this architecture could utilize a SIGINT/COMINT platform to verify the feasibility and scalability of this approach. <BR><BR>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The vision of a digital system that makes information readily available to an individual has evolved from Vannevar Bush&rsquo;s Memex concept to the revolutionary realities of the World Wide Web and millions of smaller digital collections. <span>&nbsp;</span>Today, search engines can recall thousands of potentially relevant documents in milliseconds from digital storehouses that swell by petabytes each year. <span>&nbsp;</span>Preserving, securing, analyzing, and accessing the contents of this digital ocean is essential to national security, commerce, and daily life. <span>&nbsp;</span>Current systems are divided into those that provide a query or aggregation layer on top of variably restricted and implemented systems, and those that serve the specialized needs of an enterprise, group, or individual. <span>&nbsp;</span>Major challenges still exist in creating systems that can secure, organize, characterize, search, and distribute digital information, in its many encapsulations, across a unified framework. <span>&nbsp;</span>In many ways, the management of digital information is still where computer systems were before the invention of internetworking.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For military organizations, secure access to resilient, reliable information is absolutely essential as it can be, literally, a matter of life and death. <span>&nbsp;</span>Military operations involve a multitude of networks and systems operating under various degrees of duress, with a wide variety of information needs, objectives, and constraints.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order to further explore these areas, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&rsquo;s (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) invites submission of whitepapers from all those engaged in related research activities. <span>&nbsp;</span>In addition, a DARPA-sponsored workshop has been planned for 15-16 July 2008 in Northern Virginia, for the purpose of reviewing on-going research in the implementation of distributed, resilient, and secure, digital object storage and retrieval (including analysis, query, and dissemination).<span>&nbsp; </span>Information presented at the DOSR workshop will contribute to the formulation of future areas of DARPA research, such as creating a prototype system capable of experimental deployment in an incompletely trusted network.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Authors may be invited to present related work and on-going research activities associated with digital object storage and retrieval including: <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
