The Government will evaluate the extent to which offerors identify and commit to utilizing SB, SDB, WOSB, HBCU/MI, and HUBZone Small Businesses in the performance of the contract.  Such utilization may be as the co ntractor or a subcontractor, or as a member of a joint venture or teaming arrangement.  (b) Past Small Business Utilization.

This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror's performance over the pastthree calendar years in complying with FAR 52.219-8, “Utilization of Small Business Concerns”.

<DESC>The Federal Government intends to award up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Minor Construction and Services.  The location of the work is primarily at Naval Air Facility, Key West Florida and other Federal Government locations within the Florida Keys and Key West.  However, work may also be required at other Federal Government areas within the area of responsibility of South Florida extending approximately in a horizontal line from Ft. Myers, Florida to West Palm Beach, Florida, and areas south to and including Key West, Florida.  The Government intends to set aside one contract to a certified 8(a) contractor, one to a Small Business contractor, with the other contract award unrestricted.  To receive award, all contractors must be technically qualified in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation, including satisfactory past performance.  The successful contractors will compete with each other for Task Orders under the terms of the contract.  Task Orders will be awarded based on Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable Proposal.  The value of each Task Order will be in the range of $2,000 to $100,000.  There is no limit on the number of Task Orders one contractor may receive.  However, the minimum guaranteed amount to bind each contract is $10,000 (ten thousand dollars).  The government intends to issue each contract for a base year with four option years.  The total maximum amount, including base year and option years, cumulative including all contracts, is $10,000,000 (ten million dollars).  Work will involve a variety of construction and service type requirements, which are generally, repair, maintenance, or services related to existing Federal Government facilities within the area of responsibility.  Construction requirements may include, but not be limited to, roofing, concrete, masonry, mechanical work, electrical work, facility or office renovation or rehab, paving, painting, fencing, and civil work.  Service requirements may include, but not be limited to, landscaping, debris removal and disposal, signs and lettering, pump-out of lift stations, septic tanks or grease traps, surveys, soil borings, removal of contaminated soil, oil, or other hazardous material abatement, interior or exterior cleaning of housing units, concrete pumping, inspection and cleaning of chimneys, hoods, or vents, bulk piping system pressure leak testing, invasive exotic plant removal.  It is expected and anticipated that awarded contractors will subcontract portions of the work or services as necessity dictates.  The Small Business size standard is $28.5 million.  NAICS Codes include the following 2-digit categories:  23, 33, 54, 56.  Personal services will not be ordered under this solicitation.  Interested parties are encouraged and invited to inquire at any time by telephone or e-mail.  The solicitation date is not yet established, but award is expected by September 2002.

<DESC>Services include, but are not limited to planning, architect and engineering services, and related technical services for the preparation of environmental impact documents, integrated cultural resources management plans, integrated natural resources management plans, environmental studies of various types normally used by the U. S. Navy, and technical services related to such documents as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, PACNAVFACENGCOM.  This contract will be used for the preparation of larger scale and more intensive National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental impact documents, including Environmental Impact Statements and Complex Environmental Assessments.  The A-E must have expertise and experience in conducting multi-disciplinary technical studies in the physical and biological sciences, cultural resources, noise, traffic, air quality, socioeconomic, and infrastructure analyses.  Short-fused projects may require the A-E to concurrently prepare multiple NEPA documents in a very condensed period of time.  Related technical services may include, but are not limited to, preliminary site assessment studies, feasibility assessments and civil engineering services with associated multi-discipline A-E support as required.  Examples include preparation of technical reports including conducting engineering investigations and concept studies, or feasibility assessments to obtain sufficient site data to determine the environmental impacts of a proposed action.  A preliminary site assessment study may require additional analyses, including topographic, geotechnical, hazardous materials, and infrastructural (roads, drainage, electrical, water, sewage, etc.) aspects of proposed actions.  The term environmental impact document includes but is not limited to any Scoping Document, Record of Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Environmental Assessment (EA), Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), Notice of Intent, draft or final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Record of Decision (ROD), general planning document or the requirements of such other governmental agencies for which PACNAVFACENGCOM may be tasked to provide environmental impact documents.  Also included under this contract scope are:  (a) any preparatory work, presentation, briefing, consultations, study, or report which may be required prior to the initiation of any environmental impact document, (b) supporting studies for RCEs, EAs, DEIS and EIS such as flora and fauna studies, land management plans/studies, cultural (historic and archaeological) studies and consultations, noise, air and water surveys, traffic surveys, hazardous waste impact studies, socio-economic impact studies, and (c) general planning studies.  The primary tasks anticipated under this contract are the preparation, updating, and review of environmental impact documents.  Secondary tasks may include related technical services as outlined above, preparing or updating integrated natural resources management plans, flora/fauna guides/plans, soils conservation studies, historic preservation/cultural resources studies, integrated cultural resources management plans, repatriation studies/plans, interpretive plans, and assorted environmental planning guides/brochures.  Additionally, the A-E may be assigned ancillary work involving word processing, graphics, reproduction, manuscript editing, and other services related to environmental impact documents under preparation by the A-E or by PACNAVFACENGCOM staff.  The type of environmental impact assessments/statements and studies required in the preparation of environmental impact documents will generally involve technical engineering considerations, but for some assignments, there may be no technical engineering requirements.  Project assignments may include projects for governmental agencies other than the U.S. Navy, such as the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Marine Corps, for which PACNAVFACENGCOM may be tasked to provide environmental documents.  Many military areas of work anticipated under this contract will not allow the entry of aliens.  The field crew of the A-E shall be composed of U. S. citizens who can qualify for access to military areas after appropriate security checks are made.  The A-E shall abide by prevailing security requirements during visits to such military property and shall obtain the required permits and passes in a timely manner.  The nature of specific work assignments may require the A-E to obtain a secret security clearance.  The Government utilizes the following software suite:  Microsoft WINDOWS NT 4.0/5.0 WORKSTATION, Microsoft OFFICE 2000 PROFESSIONAL (WORD 2000, POWERPOINT 2000, EXCEL 2000, ACCESS 2000), and Internet Explorer 5.5.  In preparation of documents and correspondence, the A-E shall ensure compatibility with the Government's software.  The contract will be an Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an "as-needed" basis during the life of the contract, providing the Government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project will be a firm fixed-price task order.  The Government will determine the task order amount by using the rates negotiated for the basic contract and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract base period shall not exceed twelve months or $1,250,000 total fee, whichever comes first.  The Government guarantees a minimum amount of $25,000 for the contract.  Should an impasse on the price occur over the initial or subsequent projects, the Government will apply the dollar value of the Government estimate for that project or projects toward the minimum guarantee.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional three option years, each with a maximum fee of $1,250,000 per year, for a total contract performance period of four years.  There will be no further synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.   Estimated date of contract award is on or about September 2002.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms:  (1) Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for preparing environmental impact documents and environmental studies of various types including integrated cultural resources management plans and integrated natural resources management plans that are normally used by the U.S. Department of Defense for projects and activities in the Pacific area; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm and particular staff members in the preparation of environmental impact documents and environmental studies including technical engineering studies and environmental engineering considerations.  Specialized experience shall include, but not limited to, knowledge of environmental laws and regulations, biological resources, cultural resources, traffic, noise, and air quality; (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time and ability to handle multiple projects at one time; (4) Past contract performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Architect-Engineer firm's design quality control practices/techniques, and demonstrated success in producing quality environmental impact documents; (6) Use of Small or Small Disadvantaged or Women-owned Small Business firms shall also be considered; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the projects; (8) The volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense Architect-Engineer contracts among qualified firms and firms that have not had contracts with Department of Defense.  Each firm's past performance and performance rating(s) will be reviewed during the evaluation process and can affect the selection outcome.  IN BLOCK 10 OF THE SF 255 AND ANY ADDENDUM, STATE WHY YOUR FIRM IS SPECIALLY QUALIFIED BASED ON EACH OF THE ABOVE EVALUATION CRITERIA.  FOR SELECTION CRITERIA (2), PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FOR ONLY THE STAFF PROPOSED FOR THIS WORK USING THESE COLUMN HEADINGS:  "NAME", "RELATED PROJECTS WORKED ON", "YEAR", "FIRM" AND "TECHNICAL ROLE".

<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency plans to award a contract to Defense Group, Inc. to provide professional, advisory, and management services required for Program Management support for the Restoration of Operations (RestOps) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The purposes of this is to 1) obtain outside points of view to avoid too limited judgement on critical issues within the ACTD, 2) obtain advice regarding developmentsin industry, university, or foundation research that assist the Tec hnical Manager in making judgements on the development and use of technologies for the ACTDs, 3) obtain the opinions, special knowledge, or skills of noted experts to assist working groups, policy groups, or Integrated Porduct Teams woriking within the ACT D, 4) enhance the understanding of, and develop alternative solutions to, complex issues that arise during the course of execution of the ACTD, and 5) support and improve the operation of organizations involved with supporting the ACTD.  This support will extend from the expiration date of the current contract, July 5, 2002, through the scheduled completion of the RestOps program, September 30, 2004.  DTRA believes that Defense Group, Inc. (DGI) is the only contractor capable of accomplishing this effort in  a timely and cost effective manner based on their unique extensive knowledge of the program from its inception in 1993, the trust and relationships they have developed with various participating organizations,any other source, by necessity would incur eff ort over and above that contemplated by this award to intricately coordinate with DGI's current effort and learning the idiosyncrasies of those organizations and the leaders they support, and the corporate memory of the various integrated product teams the y support.  DTRA believes that any efficiency obtained through competition could not compensate for severe delays, and additional costs of educating a different contractor on the program and methodologies particularly on a program nearing its conclusion. S ee Note 22.  No solicitation exists for this procurement.  Any questions concerning this contemplated contract award may be addressed to HQ, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, ATTN:  Mr. Edward B.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contemplates award of a contract for planning, and collaborative development and implementation of the protocol for the population-based and qualitative components of the post-intervention evaluation for Diabetes Interventions Reaching and Educating Communities Together (Project DIRECT).  

Project DIRECT is a multi-level approach to reducing the disproportionate burden of diabetes in African Americans.   Project DIRECT is the first comprehensive community based project in the United States to address the growing burden of diabetes in African Americans. The goal of the project is to use existing knowledge of diabetes risk factors and complications to implement community level interventions to reduce the prevalence and severity of diabetes in communities with large African American populations.  The post-intervention population-based survey will be a cross-sectional survey and will be conducted in the intervention community (Raleigh, NC) and the comparison community (Greensboro, NC). The CDC is collaborating with the state of North Carolina to implement and evaluate public health strategies for reducing the burden of diabetes in this predominately African American community.

The contract awardee will be expected to coordinate the planning, and collaborative development of the protocol for the population-based and qualitative components of the post-intervention evaluation; submit this protocol for approval by the institutional review boards (IRB) of the CDC, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHSS) and other organizations as necessary; develop a package for approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); and, implement the protocol.   The awardee will be responsible for data collection, data management, data analysis, and for meeting the reporting requirements of the contract.  More specifically, the awardee will be responsible for evaluating the qualitative and quantitative effects of the three intervention strategies: health promotion, diabetes outreach, and diabetes care improvement.

The period of performance is anticipated to be 36 months; a cost reimbursement type contract is contemplated.  The award type is full and open, under NAICS code 54171.   The solicitation will be posted to the  http://www.fedbizopps.gov website on/about 6/3/02.   A hard copy of the solicitation will not be issued.  It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Offerors are cautioned to include Solicitation No. 2002-N-00421 on all documentation submitted in response to this requirement.  No telephone requests/inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>AIRFIELD PAINT TRUCK.  1) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 
2) Solicitation F65501-02-R-A023 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 3) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-5.  4) This solicitation is unrestricted.  The NAICS code is 333120; Size standard: 750 employees. 5) ITEM DESCRIPTIONS: 
L/I 0001- One (1) Airfield Paint Truck to meet the following requirements: Must be a truck mounted self-contained airless application, capable of either utilizing waterborne or low VOC traffic paint.  There are specifications that we need to follow that are critical for air transportability of the truck on Air Force cargo aircraft. I have enclosed technical data obtained from Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio in regards to air transport requirements. Mr. Mark Kuntavanish (937) 785-6039 is the point of contact on this matter and is willing to give guidance in technical questions pertinent to the Air Force on airworthiness requirements. This must include provisions for tie downs that must meet transport requirements.   The base chassis must be of low profile cabover design. There are very specific height, width, length and weight requirements for transport on aircraft that must be followed. If the vehicle does not meet air transport requirements dictated by Air Force Regulations the vehicle is useless.  This is dictated by airworthiness requirements stated by Wright Patterson AFB. The following chassis will be considered: Volvo, Sterling Condor, Peterbilt or Mack.  All produce a low profile cabover chassis. The chassis selected must be new, unused and current model year. Please include an option for an air-conditioned cab. A protective canopy shall be provided to protect the operators from the sun and weather. It needs to be of sufficient design to ensure easy storage for air transportation. An Arrow board used for traffic control must be mounted in a fashion to permit loading on Air Force cargo aircraft. It may be collapsible or easily removable. Flashing strobe light beacons must be mounted on the vehicle for airfield operations. We require the paint portion of the machine to be of airless operation, with the capacity to carry 2-345/250gl bulk containers of paint. It shall have the capability to supply paint from either container to any paint gun. The machine must have the capability to paint 36" lines without lagging or pulsating, and the capability to spray 3 colors at one time. We need 3 isolated paint systems with the capability to direct paint from any of the 3 systems to any paint gun.  The truck shall have the capability to transfer paint from one tote to another, the capability to reload totes on the truck from totes on the ground, and a way to secure totes on the truck bed but still have the ability to remove the tote from the truck bed for air transport. Chain tie downs are not acceptable as a means of securing totes on the bed. The auxiliary engine should be of high quality and the most horsepower available.   All engine controls should be mounted so the rear operator can have access to them without moving from his station. The Hydraulic System should be capable of supplying more hydraulic pressure than needed. Our experience is that if the system is of minimum spec the pumps will be working at maximum output, stressing the system and causing shortened life expectancy. The air compressor shall be rotary screw type, hydraulically driven and rated to ensure maximum airflow when air demand is at its most.   Request a larger compressor then required so the compressor isn't running at maximum to keep up with demand. An air receiver with a minimum capacity of 10 gallons and a manifold built in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code. Our experience is a minimum CFM compressor soon balks when air demand is the greatest.  Require 6 paint guns and 6 glass bead guns on the left side of the vehicle and 2 paint guns and 2 bead guns on the right side. The requirement for 4" - 36" lines and various paint schemes required by Air Force regulations mandates the requirement for 6 paint guns on the left side. The carriage on the right side with the 2 paint guns and 2 bead guns are utilized in street painting operations.  The paint and bead guns should be the Kamber Model 50-A, or equal, for paint and the Kamber Model 90HO, or equal, for the bead guns. Require the paint guns to have a power open/power close feature.  A spring close feature is not acceptable as it fails at the most in opportune time, leaving paint spills and fogged edges of paint lines. Each set of guns needs to be mounted on carriages that have the capability to be moved by an operator by use of a steering wheel and shall be hydraulically operated. The carriages shall have separate wheels mounted on them to follow the surface of the pavement so the paint guns are maintained at a fixed height to the road surface. The carriages need to have the ability to be lifted by pneumatic lift cylinders controlled by the rear operator without leaving his station. Carriages need to have a means of being secured during transportation. The carriages need to be of a configuration that during transportation they are secured within the vehicle platform.  Air blower nozzles shall be installed at each gun position for clearing of debris in front of paint guns to ensure clean pavement is being painted. This needs to be an "on demand" configuration to use as needed.  Each gun needs to have the ability to be skipped to any cycle needed by the operator. The range of this skip line system shall be in .1 ft increments and have a cycle length variable from .1 ft to 999.9 ft., the system shall be electrical and not mechanical. The reason for this is the need for an infinite line combination encountered in striping of airfields, commonly called zipper lines used for traffic control on airfields are the most difficult to make.   A pressurized tank, having a capacity of 3000 Lb. of glass bead is to be provided. This tank needs to be of all steel ASME construction with a top opening of not less then 14" in diameter. A vacuum glass fill unit capable of 200 pounds of beads per minute is to be supplied with a suction hose of at least 12 feet with a quick disconnect. A bag splitter/strainer combination with a 55-gallon drum shall be provided. We require some kind of moisture separator shall be installed on the glass bead system to ensure a dry stream of beads is supplied to the bead guns. A solvent cleaning system shall be installed for flushing of the paint pumps and the entire system.  Also, it shall have separate lines to enable flushing of the paint guns only. This system needs to be of a construction to permit use of water as a solvent for use with waterborne coatings. System needs to have capability of flushing lines after the high-pressure pumps for overnight cleaning, and must have a cleaning gun to clean gun carriages after striping operation after each day.  All paint lines, valves, pumps; hose fittings and all components that are in contact with the marking material shall be of stainless steel, to ensure compatibility with waterborne coatings.  A paint heating system capable of maintaining 130* F at the paint guns is needed on the vehicle. It shall be capable of heating the entire painting system through heat exchangers that can be isolated so if heat is not required, no paint is moved through the exchanger. The system needs to have the capability of temperature control to vary output of the boiler. The boiler of the system shall be plumbed in a matter that it gets fuel from the vehicle chassis fuel tank and not a separate fuel tank. The unit shall have an intercom system with headphones for each operating station, including the driver. The headsets need to be of the noise attenuating variety and of the duel ear headset variety with closed microphones actuated by a push to talk button. The drivers set can have an open microphone and may be a wired system.  Please provide pricing for a cordless system for the rear operators.  The unit shall have an optical line guidance system and a laser line guidance system for primary guidance. A hydraulically operated mechanical boom type line guidance system shall be installed on the front as a backup in case of a failure when at remote location. A cleaning solvent gun on a retracting hose reel shall be installed for cleaning of paint guns and carriages after striping operations have ended for the day.  Request a self retracting hose reel with 50 feet of hose with an airless gun with a 2 foot extension and airless tip for doing hand work such as crosswalks, arrows etc. This reel and gun may work off any paint system.  A footage counter needs to be installed for each paint gun position, capable of measuring the precise number of feet of line actually applied.  Request one replacement gun for each gun on the unit along with a rebuilt kit for each gun. Any other replacement parts you deem necessary for operation should be included with this quote.  Successful bidder shall provide training in the use of the machine, to include operation, maintenance and safety.  6) DELIVERY:  FOB DESTINATION to Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  7) FAR 52.212-1 ?

<DESC>THIS ACQUISITION IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. Collect Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) remeasurement data, Global Positioning System (GPS) location data, and down woody fuel data from 467 CFI plots. Option to add 0 to 83 CFI plots for CFI remeasurement and down fuel inventory. Restore CFI plots located in disturbed areas. Perform routine maintenance on CFI plots outside the disturbed areas. Disturbances were due to timber harvest and wildfire. For timber harvest, the selection, shelterwood, and clear-cut silvicultural cutting methods were all commonly applied. For the larger wildfires, salvage logging was commonly applied. Pre-commercial thinning treatments were applied during the past 10 years. The CFI plots are located on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in Otero County in Southern New Mexico. A large number of the CFI plots are in ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forest cover types mixed conifer is a mixture of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, White fir, or Southwestern Wite pine). A small number of the CFI plots are in the Spruce fir cover type. Other woodland tree species are Gambel oak, Pin&#61468;i&#61465;on pine, and various Juniper species. Roads are improved/unimproved dirt roads, jeep trails, and old logging roads. 4-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Majority of the CFI plots are between 7,000 to 9,000 feet in elevation. In 1992, 467 of 550 CFI plots were remeasured. On 467 CFI plots, there was an average of 31 live trees per CFI plot. This average includes all tree species that were 5.0 inches in diameter or greater. In addition, the maximum number of trees on any single CFI plot was about 100. Since the 1992 CFI remeasurement, 30% to 50% of the CFI plots have been disturbed. During the winter (especially December and January), snow may limit access to the CFI plots. Lodging for field crews is available in Ruidoso, New Mexico and possibly in the community of the Mescalero Indian Reservation.

INDEFINITE DELIVERY / INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) SOLUTION ORDER CONCEPT MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT (MACC) AT NAVAL TRAINING CENTER, GREAT LAKES, ILLINOIS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE ENGINEERING FIELD ACTIVITY MIDWEST AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.  

This acquisition will be limited to 8(a) firms servicing the Chicago District Office which have a NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, and 235.  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.

This solicitation will result in the award of three contracts to three 8(a) contractors who provide the most advantageous, responsive and responsible proposal resulting in the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  It is the intention of this acquisition to procure renovation, alteration, repair, construction and design/build capability by means of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solution Order Concept Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Naval Training Center, Great Lakes and their fifteen state area of responsibility.  The fifteen state area of responsibility includes Naval Installations in CO, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MI, MN MO ND, NE, OH, SD, WI and WY.  However, the majority of the work will be at Great Lakes, IL.   This acquisition is for a base year of twelve months for a maximum value of $10 million.  The contract contains two twelve-month options for a total maximum duration of thirty-six months or a value of $30 million whichever comes first.

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately three to five offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling.  Phase I factors relate to the base year and two option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) and price proposals for a ?seed? project, which has been identified as Construction of a Small Arms Ammunition Bunker at the Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois.  The estimated price range for the seed project is $250,000 - $500,000.  Firms are expected to participate in the pre-proposal conference.  The Government may choose to award the seed project based on initial proposals without holding discussions.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any one or all proposers; to award the seed project to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price; and to award contracts to the three proposers submitting proposals determined by the Source Selection Authority to be the most advantageous, best value, to the Government.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price (price of seed project plus modification markups).  The best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project and an IDIQ construction contract for the base year.  The second and third contracts will be awarded at the same time with a minimum guarantee of $25,000. 
INITIAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  Phase I of this procurement will result in a narrowing of offerors to approximately three to five based on Phase I evaluation factors that include:  (1) Past Performance (2) Technical Qualifications, (3) Scheduling.  These Phase I factors relate to the base year and two option years IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, dormitory and community support type facilities, not just the seed project.  The selected firms will be selected to submit Technical and Price proposals for Phase II.  For evaluation purposes the Government will calculate the total price proposal as the sum of the seed project plus the mark up evaluation price.  After proposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made based on the individual seed project.  The selected firms will be requested to submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals in Phase II for the seed project will not be considered for an award.  The Government will award the seed project based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award to the Government.  If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal revision.  Price and overall technical rating are of equal significance for the best value awards.

OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested from approximately three to five offerors who submitted proposals during Phase I which are determined to be the most highly qualified.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions to provide an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.

FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD;  All three contractors awarded an IDIQ Contract will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value trade-off continuum or low price.  If the Government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the three IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

<DESC>This is a modification to the Presolicitation Notice for solicitation N68335-02-R-3160 which stated the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst's (NAWCADLKE) intent to contract sole source with The Boeing Company, P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO, to procure peculiar support equipment (PSE) in support of the Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR).  The aforementioned notice erroneously defined the PSE as the ATFLIR Pod Level Test Set, P/N 74D740503-1001.  The ATFLIR Pod Level Test Set is not defined by this one part number.  Rather, the ATFLIR Pod Level Test Set is defined by two part numbers with their own noun nomenclature as follows:  Electro-Optics Pallet/Pod Test (EOPT) System P/N 74D745003-1001 and the ATFLIR EOPT Ancillary Test Equipment P/N 74D740503-1001.  As stated in the aforementioned notice, the Navy intends to procure fifteen (15) ATFLIR Pod Level Test Set units as part of the base contract with three options containing fifteen (15) units each via a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement Number N68335-02-G-3117.  The Boeing Company is the only known source with the knowledge, experience and technical data required to produce this item.  The Government does not own the drawings and other design documentation.  Any firms that recognize and produce the required items are encouraged to identify themselves.  A determination by the Government whether or not to open the requirement for competition based on the responses to this notice is entirely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The 311th Human Systems Program Office, (311 HSW/YA), Brooks AFB, Texas is preparing to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) program System Development & Demonstration with Production Options (SDD/Production) contract.  The draft RFP is located in the Files Link below. There are two areas within the draft RFP that are still under construction.  They are the cost arrangement for the production options and the strategy for oral presentations.  The draft RFP will be updated in these areas at a later date.  Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements thereto.  We anticipate a single award for the SDD/Production effort.  A small business set-aside is not considered appropriate for this program effort.  The SDD contract will feature cost-reimbursement contract type with a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) pricing arrangement. Production is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price options.  The estimates for SDD and the production options are $24 and $282 million respectively.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 336413.  The contract award will be based on full and open competition.  In order to maximize opportunities to all offerors, potential offerors were notified of program progress and given instructions how to optimize their potential for successful award of the SDD/Production competition.  On 9 May 01, the San Antonio RFP and Acquisition Highway (SARAH) and Commerce Business Daily Notice to Offerors posted information to all offerors, excluding the current Program Development and Risk Reduction (PDRR) contractors, that requested the following items by the listed dates in order to be a potential offeror for the SDD/Production contract: Funding documentation to support their pro-rata share of Government Testing - 30 Jun 01; System Design Information (Conceptual Drawings) - 30 Sept 01; 14 Test Samples each Material - 31 Oct 01 and 25 Prototypes - 30 Jan 02 . During SDD, the successful offeror will translate their design approach into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective design; validate the affordability and producibility of the system, prove the production processes; and demonstrate system performance to specifications through testing. The proposal evaluation will rely substantially on results of the prototype unit Government testing.  Therefore, offerors who were unable to submit their prototypes and their share of the Government test funds, will not meet minimum criteria in the selection process.  During the  next phase (SDD) the following activities will occur: Developmental Test &Evaluation (DT&E), man-rating, safe-to-fly certification, Operational Testing &Evaluation (OT&E), technical data development, provisioning of spare parts, Functional Configuration Audit (FCA), Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and Production Readiness Review. The Government will base its decision to enter production on the results of DT&E, OT&E, production readiness, and system affordability. Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) principles will be used to meet technical requirements at a price the user is willing to pay. Teaming or partnering within industry allows for the most promising technical design and expertise. Please indicate how teaming or partnering will be considered in your approach.  We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 17 Jun 02.  The RFP will be issued via the SARAH hompage internet address:  http://sara.brooks.af.mil (Click on 311 HSW Human Systems Program Office.  Find solicitation number - F41624-02-R-1007and click on it.  Scroll down to the bottom and click on the files link.)  Information concerning this acquisition will be updated at this location   Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this draft RFP require clarification in order to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing via e-mail to the POC.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. Michael Higgins at (937) 255-6005.

<DESC>17. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to modify sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00024-99-G-5220 with Northrop Grumman Norden Systems Inc. (NGNS) of 65 Marcus Drive, Melville, NY 11747 to extend the ordering period for one year from the current expiration date of 20 June 2002.  The BOA provides for the issuance of multiple orders for Design Agent, Engineering and Technical Services in support of Engineering Changes/Product Improvement and Studies under the AN/SYS-2 (V) Integrated Automatic Detection and Tracking (IADT) System Program.  The BOA allows for the placement of firm fixed-price (FFP) type contract or cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contract orders.   NGNS is the original designer, developer, and the sole producer of the AN/SYS-2 (V) IADT System.  As such, NGNS is the only known firm possessing the requisite technical expertise and background to perfo rm the required design agent, engineering and technical services in a cost effective manner while minimizing the impact to the AN/SYS-2 (V) deliveries to the Navy’s shipbuilding schedules.  The modification will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This synopsis is for informational purposes only and the benefit of potential subcontractors.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate only with the source identified herein.  Parties interested in pursuing subcontracting opportunities are encouraged to contact the subcontracting department at the above address.  See Numbered Note(s): 22!!

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. RFQ-NCI-20034-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-06.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized in FAR 13.6.

The North American Industry Classification code is 334516, and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small business.

Background:  The Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit DNP of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently engaged in the study of fundamental mechanisms that underlie the development and remodeling of neuronal circuits in the mammalian olfactory system.  These studies use expressed fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, dsRed) in the olfactory system and will focus on imaging primary afferents as they converge and form synapses onto the olfactory bulbs.  Since these fluorophores have highly overlapping emission spectra the ability to separate their individual fluorescent signals is critical to the outcome of the experiments.

Requirement: The Microscope must use an optical grating (prism) that separates the emitted light into multiple wavelengths and then detects this light through a 32 channel detector. The system must be equipped with a spectral scanner that incorporates a 32 channel PMT using a grating for high speed, efficient, electronic switching between spectrally separated detector elements. Both binning and spectral scanning must be electronically.  The system shall be able to discriminate the fluorescence signal produced by fluorophores with widely overlapping emission spectra (i.e. GFP, YFP, FITC).   System must be capable of emission fingerprinting with at least 10nm collection upon delivery  to our facility and support all acquisition modes x,y,z,t and lambda RAPIDLY.  Performance must include rapid spectral curve generation using a lambda stack that can collect pixel by pixel 12 bit up to 2KX2K.  Any ROI selectable for immediate plot of spectral information at least 10nm resolution. System must be able to generate a Lambda - time stack of at least 80nm of information in single pass of the image for high speed kinetic acquisition. System must be able to achieve the same kinetic rate for z + lambda stacks  as well as z, time, lambda stacks.   The system will include a 40mW argon laser (458, 488, and 514) and two helium neon lasers (543nm and 633 nm).  This laser combination provides the excitation wavelengths needed to excite commonly used fluorophores.  The system will include the non-linear optical elements (NLO) essential for coupling a femtosecond laser system (MIRA 900F from Coherent) giving the confocal multi-photon capability.  The system shall have a META detector and a separate internal conventional PMT detector with independent pinhole as well as two external detectors for 2-photon sensitivity detector.  Each detector must be equipped with its own pinhole for the possibility of simultaneous scanning with identical slice thickness.  The system shall allow full 360 degree scan rotation (in 1 degree increments), scan zoom and offset with no x/y stage centering required.  The system shall include an Acousto Optical Modulator (AOM) coupling of external Coherent TI Sapphire Mira laser. Fully tunable between 700-1000nm.  Line selection and attenuation must be rapid, continuous with at least .1% increments, and fully selectable with ALL laser lines coupled to the system.  Digital Scan control to allow the following software/hardware functionality: constant scanning velocity for all speeds, even illumination along scanning field with identical pixel conditions, short fly back time(<2% of frame cycle), on-line modification of scanning and detector settings for optimum image parameters, on-line histogram and lut?s for optimization, sample preservation via beam blanking only in ROI?s and FRAP designated regions. Ease of operation and setup is critical for our multi user environment therefore the system must also provide single button control to implement identical system conditions from any previously collected image.  Reliable quantitative data must be achievable. Highly reliable linear data is critical.  

The Microscope shall be delivered FOB destination to the The Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit DNP of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) in Bethesda, Maryland and be up and running with ALL specified performance features intact and installed no later than  September 30, 2002.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform interested parties that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland, intends to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement, N00019-02-G-0350, on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, 7700 Arlington Blvd., Falls Church, Virginia in support of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tactical Control Systems (TCS) program.  The order will consist of the performance of studies and design analysis in support of the Phase I and Phase II Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program.  The near term objective is to develop an interface device that will allow a level 2 communication between the Mission Control Element (MCE) and the Tactical Support Center (TSC) for the Global Hawk Demonstration Program.  In the development of the interface device, a Tactical Control System (TCS) product, it is the Navy's goal to reuse as much of the TCS software (Block 2 Version 2) as practical and to identify feasible changes to the TSC and/or TCS for the optimum interface.  The long term goal is to achieve a fully integrated and seamless TCS/TSC system which will be used by the future BAMS UAV.  This future TCS/TSC system is envisioned to provide level 4 UAV control.  The purpose of this BOA study is to determine the feasibility and options for the fully integrated TCS/TSC.  Successful completion of this effort requires intimate knowledge of the TCS core hardware and software, various UAV related systems and the relationship of UAVs within the air reconnaissance architecture.  Raytheon Company is the only known source that possesses the peculiar engineering data, knowledge of TCS design and operation requirements, capability, and expertise required to successfully provide these supplies and services in an accurate and timely manner.  The estimated period of performance is July 2002 to January 2003.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to warnerlm@navair.navy.mil.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>USPTO Dark Fiber/Managed Lambda Request For Quotes
 
PROPOSED ISSUE DATE:  5/3/02

The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires quotes on multiple solutions for dark fiber or lambdas via Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) between two sites in Northern Virginia.  The installation schedules identified are critical requirements to support USPTO operations during the upcoming move.  Offers won't be considered which can't meet these scheduled delivery dates.  The two locations of the USPTO sites are:
 
Location A
US Patent and Trademark Office
11th  Floor Computer Room
2121 Crystal Drive
Arlington, VA 22202
 
Location B
US Patent and Trademark Office
Concourse Floor Main Distribution Frame Room
400 Dulany Street (Building E)
Alexandria, VA 22314
(new construction)

The USPTO is looking for quotes on four specific solutions:

(1 - A single point-to-point dark fiber path
(2 - Two fully-redundant and fully-diverse dark fiber paths
(3 - A single point-to-point managed-lambda path 
(4 - Two fully-redundant and fully-diverse managed-lambda paths

Path terminations will occur inside each building.  A vendor may provide a quote for one or all of the requested solutions.  However, each quote should be separate from any other quote, to allow the USPTO an opportunity to consider each solution and quote separately and independently.  

For quotes (2 and (4, the proposed solution must be fault tolerant, provide redundant and fully diverse (conduit & manhole diversity) paths, and provide diverse entrances into the building at Location A and into the USPTO manhole at Location B.  At Location B, the path from the USPTO manhole and the Main Distribution Frame Room is fixed.  

The requirements for dark fiber are:
?	Two strands of dark fiber via one path and two strands of dark fiber via another path (fully diverse) from Location A to Location B (this path is needed by August 2003).  

The requirements for lambda via DWDM are:
?	Two 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and two Fibre Channel interfaces on protected lambdas from Location A to Location B (required by August 2003).  


For each quote, please provide the following information:
 
?	A geographical map depicting the actual path proposed.  Indicate on the map whether all, or some, of the path is aerial or buried.  For quotes (2 and (4, the map should clearly indicate the diversity of proposed paths (conduit and manholes) from Locations A and B.
?	The network security, network topology & infrastructure, support & service, Service Level Agreements, and fiber protection.  
?	An installation schedule.
?	Identify any known or anticipated right-of-way problems.
?	A differentiation between non-recurring costs (NRC) and monthly recurring costs (MRC) (using commercial and/or government pricing).  For NRC, differentiate costs for feasibility and engineering studies versus costs for construction and installation.
?	If quote is part of an existing GSA contract or schedule, provide the contract and schedule number under consideration.  If other government contracts are considered, provide name of government agency currently using contract, contract number, and name/telephone number of Contracting Officer at government agency.
?	For all options quoted provide NRC and MRC for a three-year base period contract and five option years.
?	The month and year when the first MRC is expected to be paid by the USPTO. Provide a monthly schedule of all prices for both the base and option years.
?	Provide previous installations and references.
?	Any terms, conditions, disclaimers, and/or limitations connected with the quote.

USPTO intends to award a contract/contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror or offerors whose offers, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical, price and past performance.  Multiple awards may be made when that results in the most advantageous combinationof solutions that achieve the required redundancy.
The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

All questions regarding this notice should be submitted to Brenda Carswell, via e-mail at Brenda.carswell@uspto.gov, or via telephone at 703/305-9127.  All responses to any questions received will be posted on the USPTO's web site, located at www.uspto.gov.

The deadline for submitting quotes is 5:00 pm EST, May 17, 2002.

The Boeing Company is the current JDAM prime contractor, and has sole responsibility for design and warranty of the JDAM weapon system.  Boeing is not required to furnish a technical data package to the Systems Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available to interested sources to aid in accomplishment of the receiver upgrade.  The scope of this effort is to design and test an upgraded GPS receiver compliant with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) security protocol and the addition of added signal acquisition capability in a jammed environment.  Direct all questions and routine communication concerning this acquisition to the contracting officer, Ms. Stacey Hughes, (850) 882-3525 ext 3124.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns relating to this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager previously identified.

BACKGROUND
	The Fishery Sampling Branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Science Center oversees the placement of fishery observers on commercial fishing vessels.  The placement of these observers may be required by various federal laws, most notably the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   Additionally, the presence of observers is mandated by various fishery management plans (FMP's) and by some Atlantic coastal states' fishery regulations.  The industry, in general, is aware of the program and its function but this understanding does not always extend to the docks and the individual vessels.  The objective of this requirement is to develop materials to educate the industry (at the vessel level) of the program's mission and objectives as well as the authority under which NEFSC operates.  Additionally,  a kiosk display needs to be developed to present at trade shows and fish expo's in order to attain wide dissemination of the program's story to the public and fishing industry.
	
SCOPE OF WORK
	Through consultations with the Fishery Sampling Branch staff at Woods Hole, the contractor shall design and prepare various hand-out materials suitable for presentation to the industry to educate them on the Observer Program's objectives and goals. 

	One document shall cover the basic Observer Program, its development, purpose, and legislative mandates.  This document shall be several pages long and prepared as a brochure.  Other documents shall focus on specific fisheries, and/or specific Fisheries Management Plans that require observers.  This would include, but not be limited to, Gillnet, Trawl, Seine, and Long-line Fisheries.  These documents shall be prepared as one (1) double-sided, laminated document which is suitable for observers to take along on vessels.  These hand-outs shall be directed towards the industry in situations which have not typically had observer coverage or in situations where compliance has been an issue. 

	Excerpts from the handouts shall be consolidated into a traveling kiosk to be used by NMFS at various trade shows and fish expo's along the east coast.

DELIVERABLES AND TIME TABLE

June 1st		Initial meeting between NMFS and vendor to begin discussions to gather information and visuals for preparation of the documents.

August 1st		Draft documents are presented for NMFS review

September 15th	Final versions of documents and the Kiosk are presented

<DESC>THIS NOTIFICATION IS MODIFIED TO ADD NAICS CODE 561990 TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (DATE OF MODIFICATION IS 5/3/02). The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) is seeking sources of COMMERCIALLY available technologies suitable for In-Transit Visibility (ITV) is defined as: The ability to track identity, status, and location of supplies and equipment cargo (excluding bulk petroleum, oils and lubricants) from origin to consignee or destination across the range of military operations. We envision Naval transportation nodes (ARG, MPF shipping) will be instrumented to allow the capture of ITV data at entry/exit points (Well Decks, Vehicle ramps, underway replenishment stations).  Sustainment items (rolling stock, 20-ft shipping containers, Quadroons, palletized loads) will have RFID tags/sensors affixed.  This ITV architecture should be compatible with current USMC Information System architecture and shipboard systems.  The system will be designed for high portability/transport and can be rapidly employed and put into service without extensive support equipment or specialized crew.  The system will need to be designed to achieve high reliability; availability and durability to ensure it will be operational under extreme conditions.  Technical objectives consist of optimized design configurations based on transportability, interoperability and employment requirements; high reliability, availability, maintainability and durability; safety features, and advanced materials that either eliminate or significantly reduce life cycle costs.  Key components of this system demonstration will be the sensors and the readers to be used in detecting the presence of items.  The sensors will be attached to the items of interest, for example a truck or container.  The readers will be used to locate the sensors (e.g. the items) and transmit the location data to a central storage device such as a computer server.  The computer server would be provided with the ability to interface (seamlessly) with the shipboard IT 21 infrastructure and into the Navy-Marine Corp network.  The data would then be accessible from remote locations via the Network. The project office conducted an initial assessment of the technical challenges involved in this effort.  This assessment identified a number of issues or factors that potentially may influence/impact the design of this RFID system. These issues include: (1) Physical/Environmental: Exposure to moisture, weather, saltwater, wear on the equipment, etc. and the need to perform a ship alteration if the RFID system was permanently installed on-board ship; (2) Radio Frequency Issues: On-board and host nation frequency approval issues that may preclude a system from being employed; (3) Wireless Security: Encryption, Authentication etc. Need to be aware of security requirements for passing data wirelessly from Tag to Interrogator to Server.  (RF Issues should include wireless security); (4) Life Cycle Support: Battery life, high reliability, availability, maintainability and durability, etc; (5) Safety: Portability vs. non-portability, tying into the ships electrical system, RF interference issues, etc. Respondents should provide the following information:  Name and address of Company, Company Point-of-Contact with phone and fax number (email address if available), Brochures and/or pamphlets and technical data concerning technical challenges involved in this effort.  Responses should pertain only to Equipment Product Information sought, do not include software/software development information. Deadline for receipt of response is 31 May 2002. Submit all responses to: Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Contracts Office, Port Hueneme, 3502 Goodspeed Street, Suite 2 Building 41, Port Hueneme, CA, 92043-4337. It is requested that all proprietary information that is not to be disseminated in government documents be clearly identified. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR SOLICIATION AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE RESPONSE HERETO, OR ON FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION SUBSEQUENTLY SOUGHT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MADE.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN IFB, RFP, RFQ, OR CONTRACT.

This contract will also include projecting and implementing shutdown and closure of the CCS.  Using the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), the SMC anticipates that this effort will be available only from the original source.  This is predicated upon substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Interested offerors should submit a statement of capability that convincingly demonstrates that continuity and program success will not be compromised.  Any firm which believes it possesses the above technical expertise is encouraged to provide written notification to the Contract Manager.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the requisite technical expertise.  Written responses, including corporate interest, capabilities, and relevant experience (not to exceed 10 pages), should be sent electronically to Capt Richard Marsh at richard.marsh@cisf.af.mil no later than 20 May 02.  A solicitation for this extension may or may not be established in support of this effort.  Only written responses will be considered.  VERBAL RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the information provided is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The IRS is in the process of analyzing the capabilities within the market place to provide training space administrative services in IRS Campus Centers at 10 sites located in Andover, Massachusetts; Chamblee, Georgia; Holtsville, New York; Covington, Kentucky; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Fresno, California; Overland Park, Kansas/Kansas City, Missouri; Ogden, Utah; and Austin, Texas.  This function currently comprises 194 training rooms, ranging in size from auditorium to breakout rooms.  Some of the training rooms are equipped with computers.  Approximately 10,000 annual training events are scheduled in the rooms.  Events range from hour-long training sessions to sessions spanning several months.  Since the facilities are open 24-hours a day, business managers at the campus may ask to schedule a training session, and will expect administrative training staff support, at any hour.  Customers of the training centers are all employees of the agency, which comprises approximately 63,600 customers. The IRS is interested in those contractors that have experience in supporting training centers who are able to perform all of the following functions:  
1.	Scheduling classroom space to maximize usage; including resolving conflicts.  This is especially important, since many training events are time-sensitive and cannot be easily rescheduled to periods of low training activity
2.	Ordering and providing supplies for instructors and students, receiving course materials (internal textbooks, commercial texts, and government forms) and notifying customer contact  points of classroom locations
3.	Set-up and maintenance of classrooms and equipment, including AV equipment and computer hardware
4.	Providing instructor orientation to the facility, its equipment, and its services
5.	Photocopying class materials for the instructors 
Since access to the facilities is restricted to government employees, access to the facility requires Federal government background checks.  Background checks are submitted to a federal background investigation center and are not paid for by the Government.  The agency will provide the facility including training furniture and equipment from its current facilities (e.g., tables, chairs, podiums, overhead projectors, VCRs and computer hardware, etc.).  Through this RFI, IRS seeks interested, experienced parties to furnish capabilities statements with information illustrating the existence and experience in these services.  
IRS will use the information provided in the responses to this RFI to assess the interest and desire of either contractor or Government organizations in providing these types of administrative training services in a Campus Center environment.  
Based on that assessment, IRS will decide whether to issue a solicitation for the services. This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to this RFI will not be considered as proposals or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 
Address responses to Arthur Dalton (202/283-1172), IRS-A:P:P:P:, 6009 Oxon Hill Rd., Oxon Hill, MD 20745.  Fax responses acceptable: 202/283-1529.  E-mail responses acceptable: Arthur.L.Dalton@irs.gov.  All final written responses to this RFI should be received by 5/17/02, 16:00 local time.

<DESC>DESC:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and  Information Services (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking potential sources to provide the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery.   The information received will be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its affiliated U.S. Government (USG) agencies, such as the U.S. Navy,  to assess the availability of sources for commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for the remainder of 2002 and beyond.

All responsible sources are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience.  State whether large, small or disadvantaged business concern.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 514199 applies.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this request.   

NOAA and the U.S. Navy conduct numerous operational programs for which SAR data provides mission critical information.  These data are required for monitoring environmental conditions in oceans, coastal regions, lakes and rivers, and for other areas of interest worldwide, including the monitoring of natural and human-induced hazards.  The requirements for these data are documented in the Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD) II (dated 9/12/01) for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) available in the Latest News section at http://npoesslib.ipo.noaa.gov.  

NOAA is seeking information on the (1) readiness and performance, (2) licensing and distribution, (3) schedule and cost, (4) volume and area of interest for missions, and (5) statement of capabilities and other comments to provide commercial SAR satellite imagery as described below. 

1.  Please provide a description of your technical capabilities to provide commercial SAR satellite imagery.  At a minimum, address the following:

-	Sensor(s) and satellite(s) 
-	Frequency of coverage (repeatability)
-	High level formats (e.g. CEOS, GeoTIFF, other)
-	Low level data formats (e.g. Level 0 data)
-	Data content (sigma-naught, beta-naught, or other value, calibrated)
-	Data representation (8-bit vs 16-bit)
-	Applications look-up tables (e.g. ice LUT)
-	Data compression (MrSid, other)
-	Ordering processes and required lead times
-	Anticipated file sizes, delivery mechanisms and time lines. 

2.  NOAA is seeking limited data rights to broadcast and distribute SAR satellite imagery for environmental monitoring, education,  non-commercial, and other governmental purposes.  Data and data products or value-added products containing commercial SAR satellite imagery will not be distributed to other commercial entities.  Please describe your current copyright and license agreements.  Address distribution to academic institutions, scientific organizations, or contractors who are acting on behalf of the U.S. government for non-commercial applications.   Discuss the possibility for data sharing with other governments worldwide in areas of common operations, e.g., among foreign national ice centers.

3.  Please provide a schedule and rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) for the costs to the U.S. government to acquire commercial SAR satellite imagery.  Discuss pricing options based on volume, multi-year contracts and redistribution tiers.

As an option, NOAA would like to use its Fairbanks, Alaska Command and Data Acquisition Station to acquire and process SAR satellite imagery.

<DESC>NA We intend to award a sole source contract to KOR Electronics, 11958 Monarch St., Garden Grove, CA 92841 for a Universal Radar Targets Simulator (URTS).  This is a high precision, portable radar simulator using proven Digital Radio Frequency Memories (DRFM)  technology.  The URTS will provide for laboratory direct connection (injection capability) and free space illumination of radar systems for test and evaluation, operator training and mission preparation.  Operation shall be in any 400 Mhz band from 2GHz t o 18 GHz and shall generate coherent, high fidelity target returns.  The URTS is sole source to KOR because of the need for compatibility with other similar systems already present on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and at other test ranges.  The integrit y of the comparison of data between sources, requires that the data be generated in a like format.  KOR DRFM technology is already located at various WSMR and other DOD test sites.  The introduction of data generated by another vendor's DRFM technology wou ld make the sharing and comparing of data very difficult.  See Note 22 (any proposals must be received within 10 days from the date of this publication).

<DESC>NA Potential Sources Sought:  Marine Location Marker (MLM), MK58, Modifications 1, NSN: 1370-01-074-0591 - DODIC L580.  The Coast Guard and Navy use the MK 58 Mod 1. The marker is launched from aircraft in either day or night to mark the course of enemy subma rines in antisubmarine warfare operations.  Markers may be launched from high-speed aircraft or helicopters.  They can be used for any type of air to sea surface marking that are referenced by smoke and flame.  A marker consists of an aluminum body approxi mately 21.78 inches in length and 5.03 inches in diameter, weighing approx 11.5 pounds.  The center of gravity should be 7.93 inches from the base end of the marker.  It is activated upon entry into seawater and produces yellow flame and white smoke for a minimum of 40 minutes and a maximum of 60 minutes.  The marker is armed by removal of an adhesive backed metallic foil strip.  A pull ring removes the foil strip.  A replaceable protective cover protects the ignition end of the marker in shipping.  A respo ndent must have personnel trained, skilled and experienced in handling of red phosphorous compositions that are extremely flammable and environmentally sensitive.  Specialized formulation skills are necessary to meet the precise burn time ranges required f or the MK-58.  Also required are unique pressing, testing and assembly equipment designed and tooled for production of very sensitive/volatile hazardous materials.  Facilities must meet proper fire/explosive safety requirements, such as deluge systems, suf ficient storage and manufacturing space to meet quantity distance requirements.  The Navy is the design agency for these markers.  A technical data package is available for review but the Navy intends to develop a form, fit and function technical data pack age for the fiscal year 2003 requirements.  Projected procurement quantities are approximately 1700 per year and expected to increase substantially.  Interested companies may propose using commercially available or a modified commercially available marker,  provided they meet the requirements of the performance specification.  Also include a description of company capabilities and qualifications to HQ OSC, ATTN: AMSOS-PRB, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000.  Request that companies interested in producing the MLMs respond to the sources sought no later than 03 June 2002 and identify as Marine Location Marker Sources Sought/Market Research as the subject of your response.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to make a firm-fixed price, award to provide technical assistance for several programs that include sensors that provide Intelligence and Early Warning to various ground components in a multi-theater scenario. Assistance consists of functionalities, capabilities, and operational impacts. A solicitation will be issued by Gov.Works under the franchise authority of the Department of Interior on behalf of US Army PMO ARL, Bluemont, VA.  The Army requires technical assistance in the area of sensor electronics for various ground and airborne payloads.  Offeror must be able to perform the following activities in support of the program offices.  1.  Analysis ? Understand the requirement from the user community and generate technical analysis in the form of graphics, papers, programs that support a set of solutions that either indicates success or failure of an approach.  An in-depth knowledge of the sensors under consideration is essential.  The ability to analyze raw complex data and perform the playback operation with parametric is required.   2.  Proof of Principle ? The offeror must be able to provide special proof of principle equipment to include but not limited to Doppler MTI Repeaters, Ground Surveillance Raiders, Video Dissemination Resources, along with design documentation in small quantities for the evaluation of prime mission equipment.  3. Training ? Aid and execute a training program that encompasses the soldiers in the unit and the prime (subcontractor) contractor along with the material developer and accomplishes the objective of generating competence in the use of the sensors.  This is a recurring activity due to high turnover in the Military.  Soldier's ability to grasp and retain training varies widely across the spectrum.  4.  Testing/Fielding ? Provide technical support for all elements of testing and fielding the sensors and associated equipment.  Establishing attainable test objectives and providing ground support in the way of ancillary test fixtures/equipment for the duration of the test is included.  The ability to show why a sensor was unable to meet the objectives and developing a remedial plan for re-testing is also essential.  This testing can be formal or informal engineering tests and may be conducted either CONUS or OCONUS.  5. Enhancements ? All users of sensors ultimately require major enhancements to meet the new threats that have arisen since fielded.  These enhancements often involve complex redesigns that stress the configuration envelope. The offeror must be capable of giving specific technical assistance to the Government in meeting these new requirements, along with feasibility and trade-space studies that support an approach.  Often, an approach will be directed and then a justification must be produced along with any caveats. 6.  IPR, TIM, CDR Support ? Frequent program reviews where positions are defended to Army leadership and vendors are required to be attended and supported by the offeror.  Advance planning and support in the form of quad charts and briefing slides are expected to be produced and briefed at various levels.  The offeror must remain current on technology as applicable to this effort by attending O-6 Steering committees, seminars, conferences and other reviews.  Reports and documentation are expected from these activities.  7.  Source Selection ? Occasionally a source selection board will be convened to select a vendor from a competition.  The contractor must have no conflict of interest issues with serving on these boards and must be able to filter a vast amount of data for relevancy.  8. Clearances ? The offeror must have a current Top Secret facility clearance and employ TS-SCI engineering staff who can be cleared at the highest levels of SI to execute this program.  Travel ? An extensive amount of CONUS and OCONUS travel is required to meet the objectives of the customers.  The contractor must be flexible and able to support extended fielding exercises. There is an incumbent contractor who has been performing this work.  The Government anticipates awarding a three year IDIQ contract.  This is a request for qualification statements only.   POC: Department of the Interior; Attention: Rhonda Fernandez, 381 Elden Street - MS 2510; Herndon, VA 20170. Questions can be e-mailed to Rhonda.Fernandez@mms.gov.  Phone calls will not be accepted or acknowledged.

<DESC>Since 1973, the USGS Optical Science Laboratory has been responsible for calibrating film cameras for the aerial mapping community and has gained wide recognition in providing that service.  Today, with the introduction of digital technology, the aerial mapping community has a choice of using film or digital cameras for their mapping projects.  However, the USGS does not presently offer the capability to calibrate the new digital cameras as it does film cameras.  In 2000, a panel of experts commissioned by the USGS and the ASPRS (American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) recommended that the USGS obtain a digital camera calibration capability to satisfy this National need.  In response to that recommendation, the USGS is in need of a digital camera calibration system capable of determining the following geometric calibration parameters:  focal length, principal point, Gaussian and balanced coefficients of radial and decentering distortion, and coefficients to model differential scale.  The system needs to be highly automated and incorporate rigorous mathematical modeling equivalent to the SMAC (Simultaneous Multiframe Analytical Calibration) program used in the USGS analog calibration facility.  It also needs to be capable of calibrating a wide variety of digital cameras suitable for aerial mapping and transportable so that the system can be moved to other USGS sites.   Pictometry International has submitted an unsolicited proposal for their current operational digital camera calibration system enhanced to meet the requirements stated above and would be delivered to a USGS site within nine (9) months after agreement.   The USGS is seeking alternative solutions to provide a digital camera calibration capability that:  (1) meets the geometric calibration requirements stated above;(2)  can handle a broad spectrum of digital cameras, and; (3) satisfies the aerial mapping community?s needs.  Proposed alternative solutions should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer.  This notice is for informational purposes only; no solicitation package exists.  This may represent the Government?s only notice of this procurement.  The point of contact for this announcement is Maggie Russell at (703) 648-7366, fax (703) 648-7901, or e-mail at mrussell@usgs.gov. See note 22.
