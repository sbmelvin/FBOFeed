<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27.  

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure Algorithm and System Interface Development and Data for Distribution for the Visible Human Project Insight Toolkit (ITK) in its effort to promote and extend ITK, its open-source software initiative in image processing tools.  The NLM application programmers interface (API), known as ITK, is the core of this software development project.  Proposals meeting the following mandatory requirements may be submitted for review and approval:  (a) algorithm validation data collection and data processing (with a focus on time-varying data applications such as longitudinal data collections on chronic, degenerative diseases) as well as tools for managing public data collections; and/or (b) contract programming that extends ITK through incorporating additional algorithm families not already represented in ITK or projects that incorporate ITK into software and hardware systems in support of clinical applications (with an emphasis on multidisciplinary, multi-scale, practical applications).  Project proposals must be submitted as algorithms to be included in ITK and must comply with style, documentation, and coding conventions for Insight software, or the software deliverable must adapt ITK or its software engineering components to be part of the foundation of public data processing services or products.  Alternately, data collections for algorithm validation are also included in the request for quotes, provided that all examples, data, and software tools are compatible with the existing Insight software base.

NLM is specifically seeking contractors with the discipline necessary to work on an open-source software project, adhering to high standards of quality and consistency with the existing project code.  Contractors will be required to make commitment for up to one year for programmers and systems integrators to assist in the implementation of their software.

<ARCHDATE>07162005
<CONTACT>SANDIE WILLIAMSON CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369337     slwillia@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Hazards Team (GHT), National Seismic Hazard Mapping Group (NSHMG), Golden, CO has a requirement for research activities supporting specialized seismic hazard analysis and cost benefit analysis.  The Geologic Hazards Team conducts research in geology, geophysics, seismology and engineering seismology in order to assess seismic hazards and risk on regional, national, and international scales.  The GHT and NSHMG produce National Seismic Hazard Maps that are incorporated with the International Building Codes.  Currently the IBC is adopted by jurisdictions in 44 states and is being used to design billions of dollars worth of new construction each year.  However, there is some resistance to IBC adoption in the Central U.S, largely due to the fact that the 500-year recurrence time of large earthquakes has lead to a faulty perception that the risk is low.  There is concern about the cost of implementing new IBC provisions when compared to the benefits in terms of loss reduction.  The lack of cost-benefit analysis of the seismic provisions in the IBC is an obstacle towards the full adoption of products based on the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps.  The expected annualized losses of property and lives from earthquakes for the existing building codes and the reduction in losses that would occur under new IBC provisions will be evaluated and a quantitative assessment of the extra costs of implementing the new IBC provisions will be determined.  The cost effectiveness of mitigation between areas of short recurrence times and relatively robust infrastructure (e.g. California) and long recurrence times and fragile infrastructure (e.g. central and eastern U.S.) will be part of this study.  Therefore, the USGS, GHT  seeks the services of a firm with personnel experienced in seismic hazards analysis and cost benefit analysis, with expert knowledge and experience in the area of cost benefit analysis, fragility curve development, and computation of expected earthquake losses, with a background in civil and structural engineering familiar with the IBC to conduct a rigorous cost-benefit analysis for regions throughout the United States to evaluate the cost of adopting the IBC versus its benefits for reducing the losses of property and lives from future earthquakes to perform the work proposed herein.  The work being performed under this requirement does not require certification by a registered or licensed engineer.  The services described herein are not architectural and engineering services therefore are not subject to the Brooks Act.  It is anticipated that this contract will be for one 12-month base year with one additional 12-month renewal option period.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business with a NAICS Code of 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This is not a commercial item.  The Solicitation for this procurement will be available on or about August 13, 2004.  This announcement closes on September 2, 2004.  No written requests for the solicitation will be honored, the solicitation will be provided on http://ideasec.nbc.gov through the Federal Business Opportunity at http://www.fedbizopps.gov   Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Sandie Williamson at 303-236-9337 or at slwillia@usgs.gov   See Numbered Notes 1, 12, and 26.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) of the Government’s intent to solicit for potential sources for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 through FY 06.  The Government intends to compete and award the entire Air Force Summer Faculty Program by 29 September 2004 with one option as stated herein. Furthermore a formal Request for Proposal via the Federal Business (FEDBIZOps) web site (http://www.eps.gov) for potential sources for the SFFP as described herein will be announced on or around 1 July 2004 from the United States Air Force, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) seeking a qualified contractor for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 with one option for FY 06.    In 1979, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) initiated the Summer Faculty Research Program (SFRP) to introduce research faculty into Air Force laboratory facilities across the US.  The intent of the program has been to bolster research efforts and build critical links between Air Force scientists and their counterparts in the academic community.  The original SFRP was concluded in 1999 and a new program, the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program replaced it.  Under the SFFP, US College, university, or technical institute faculty members (known as SFFP fellows) perform mentor-based research in areas of interest to the Air Force in Air Force research facilities. The objectives of the program are to: 
1)	Provide the fellows high-quality, meaningful, mentor-based research at AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
2)	 Provide the fellows opportunities to stimulate professional relationships among the scientists and engineers in AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
3)	Enhance the research interests and capabilities of faculty in the US academic community
4)	Elevate the awareness of the US academic community of Air Force research needs 
During the summer, the fellows, under the mentorship of AF researchers, will conduct research at Air Force research facilities for a period of eight (8) to twelve (12) weeks.  AFOSR intends to award between forty (40) to one hundred (100) awards per year with awards restricted to university faculty members with PhDs in science, mathematics, or engineering and who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. To be considered qualified for this effort; prospective sources must demonstrate detailed knowledge and experience in the following areas: 
•	Ability  to advertise and select outstanding researchers who hold doctoral degrees, including providing an on-line web-site method of applying for the SFFP
•	Ability to establish an applicant review (evaluation) process and assemble review panels of experts to evaluate candidates’ applications (Panel experts shall be authorities in their field with previous research experience related to the areas of interest to the Air Force). 
•	 Ability to establish and maintain a database of AFRL research mentors for SFFP fellows, and a database of research interests for Air Force research facilities to provide high-quality research opportunities in these technical areas
•	Ability to establish and maintain a financial management system for electronically issuing fellows stipends and tracking costs.
•	Have an established prestigious reputation in science and engineering fellowship management. 
	 Under a contract, the dispensation provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Fee arrangement. The contract will cover administrative costs of the program and also for transfer of funds (pass through funds) to the contractor to pay recipient stipends. The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 56110, Management Services, size standard $30.0M.  Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code.  
	   	Interested persons may identify their interest to respond to the requirement or submit proposals at the appropriate time. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  For technical questions, contact the Program Manager, Ms. Leslie Peasant, at (703) 696-7316, e-mail, leslie.peasant@afosr.af.mil.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to the Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), Columbus, Ohio, for the design and fabrication of one Whole System Live Agent Testing (WSLAT) fixture.  Under the proposed contract, BMI will design the WSLAT fixture and then fabricate it inside the existing Material Test Facility (MTF) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  The WSLAT fixture will be used to challenge the Joint Biological Point Detector System (JBPDS) to confirm its ability to identify a select group of live biological agents. The JBPDS is the first DoD detector system that has been required to have the complete system challenged by live agents before it will be approved for Full Rate Production (FRP), imposed by a memorandum from the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).  The WSLAT fixture will have inner dimensions large enough to be able to house a complete JBPDS system (approximately 42 inches wide, 16 inches deep , and 58 inches tall) and will disseminate and contain up to BL-3 live biological agents.  The WSLAT system is being proposed to address the immediate need imposed by the DOT&E for the JBPDS program.  The proposed WSLAT system will be self contained in the Closed System Chamber room of the MTF at DPG.  The anticipated period of performance is 24 months with an estimated value of $14.2M.  Only BMI possesses the unique knowledge and experience required for the type of technology necessary to design and fabricate the WSLAT system.

<DESC>The planned work is to 1) Use on site materials to fill in an excavated channel and 2) build a rock chute drop structure.  These items are further explained as follows.

1)	The existing channel is 20-30 ft wide, 8 ft deep by 8000 ft long.  The banks are basically vertical, with some vegetation.  The plan is to use the soil located on each side of the channel to fill the existing channel and make a new channel that is shallow (2-5 ft deep) by 100 ft wide.  The material required to fill the existing channel will determine the exact dimensions used for the planned channel.

2)	The Rock chute at the lower end of the channel will be constructed using rock adjacent to the site (approx 1 mile haul).  This rock section will be approximately 4-5 ft thick, 77 ft long and an average of 80 ft wide.  The rock will have an average size of 3 ft and there will be either a geotextile or aggregate filter under the rock.  

The site is approximately 20 miles East of Ephrata, WA and is located along State Route 28.  Access to the site is good.


This is a total HUBZone Set-Aside

Estimated Amount:  $50,000 - $100,000

Solicitations will be issued on or about August 6, 2004

NIAID is in the process of designing and constructing a state of the art Integrated Research Facility (IRF).  The scanner must be modified to suit the containment application and state-of-the-art at the time of delivery with full complements of accessories. The offeror will be responsible for modifications of the equipment to meet containment requirements and will work with the project design team to ensure containment requirements are met.  The offeror will be required to participate in mock up and tests with the design team to ensure the containment integrity and provide for up to four (4) factory trips for a team of four (4) (commissioning agents and NIAID representatives) to witness all acceptance testing.  The offeror shall comply with the following general considerations in high containment:  (1) areas and spaces where animals will be processed before, during and after scan procedures shall operate under the guidelines of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 4th Edition (BMBL), CDC/NIH; all standard practices and special practices as outlined in the BMBL for ABSL-4 suit laboratories and for ABSL-4 vertebrate animal holding shall be practiced as standard operating procedures; (2) primary containment, as outlined in the BMBL, will be adopted where possible for limiting aerosol generation of infectious agent and preventing cross-contamination with other experiments.  As such, animals will wherever feasible, be kept in primary containment devices, including during imaging procedures; (3) separation of containment and non-containment zones shall be by a containment barrier; the barrier shall be constructed such that it can meet air tightness criteria (pressure decay test) and withstand chemical corrosiveness testing common for all containment spaces in this project as contained in the BMBL guidelines.  Construction of the containment barrier shall be by the General contractors unless the required equipment forms part of the containment barrier; those parts of the equipment forming the barrier and exposed to the contaminated side shall perform to the same standards as the rest of the barrier; (4) install all feasible equipment parts in non-containment space, separated from the containment zone and orient equipment so that regular and long-term maintenance can be performed without entering the containment zone and (5) maintenance and calibration that can not be performed outside the containment zone shall be performed either once annually (post fumigation of space) or shall be performed in compliance with the standard and special practices as described in the BMBL for BSL-4 suit laboratory space.  To minimize the footprint within the containment area, locate all support equipment and support space in the service floor directly above the magnet or gantry as feasible.  The offeror must comply to the following specific high containment design issues:  (1) containment barrier -  (a) isolate of bore/gantry space; (i) separate the animal (patient) zone from the equipment magnet bore space or gantry and develop with the project design team separation containment by means of a sealed tube extension of the containment barrier; modify equipment (removal of cladding, etc.) to provide enough space inside tube for group 2 non-human primate that is inside isolation device; (ii) assist project design team in designing animal isolator and provide information with respect assist is integration of RF coils within isolator design; (iii) develop calibrated movement system (table mechanics) within containment “tube.” and (iv) visual access of the animal patient is required by the person at remote controls (may be via CCTV); (b) cable routing across containment barrier – (i) assist the project design team in designing all cable penetrations across the containment barrier; (ii) wiring and cable penetrations across the containment barrier must be constructed to meet containment barrier performance criteria; typically, cable shielding will be stripped to expose conductor; solid conductors, not multi-stranded, are preferred and may be required; conductors are encased in epoxy or other material resistant to chemical typically used in containment environments to provide a gas-tight penetration and (iii) provide redundant cabling for future applications.  Unless cables can be changed out, provide 100% redundancy of all conductors; (2) controls and interfaces:  (a) separation of animal procedure and control space; (i) equipment controls and data capture will be separated from animal patient procedure room.  Controls will be operated form outside containment.  Separate animal handler will process animal patient in the equipment.  (ii) animal handler may need to work with, modify the animal patient’s physical and metabolic condition before, during and after a scan procedure, including administration of additional.   Assist the design team to work through these procedures and confirm the ability to safely and efficiently do same (this is not anticipated to require equipment modification at this time); (b) equipment Controls and Operation: (i) customize equipment controls where practical to operate outside the containment zone; (ii) where controls and user interface are required in the containment zone, ensure that the operation is manageable in a BSL-4 suit laboratory environment; (iii) controls, including electronics and switches that are installed in the BSL-4 suit environment must be able to withstand fumigation decontamination processes or must be able to be easily disconnected and stored when the general space undergoes decontamination; (c) communication between control space and animal handler; (3) Decontamination; (a) Fumigation; (i) investigate compatibility with current fumigation methods for decontamination, including paraformaldehyde, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  Assist the design team in integrating decontamination strategies with equipment; (ii) modify equipment to promote complete surface fumigation decontamination.  Eliminate concealed and hidden surfaces that can be inspected and surface decontaminated; and (4) physical requirements; (a) structural; (i) maximum total weight (individual equipment) 8Kpa; (ii) maximum point load 34Mpa.  Equipment must be analyzed for containment design issues such as:  installation access; maintenance access; removal access; equipment size and weight; life cycle expectations and decontamination, effects on equipment and shielding etc.  Upon acceptance of such test by NIAID, the offeror will be required to schedule the delivery, receiving and installation with the project officer (TBD).  The approximate final construction of the IRF is estimated to be mid- FY 2007.  Delivery will not take place until the building is completed.  NIAID is not or will not be responsible for storage of the equipment before the final acceptance of equipment in place.  After the completion of the installation of equipment on site, the offeror will be required to test and commission the equipment for final acceptance by NIAID.

To upgrade the current data acquisition and processing software for the Site Characterization and Analysis Penetrometer System (SCAPS) high-resolution piezocone.  The software shall be incorporated into the WinOCPT platform to create a seamless interface between the probe, specific data processing options, and a digital output format compatible with current WinOCPT capabilities.  In turn, the revised WinOCPT data output shall incorporate piezocone-derived data elements that can be displayed and modeled using Groundwater Modeling Software (GMS).  Ideally, data acquisition and processing functions will be controlled using WinOCPT, with an output format allowing for modeling of three-dimensional distribution of potentiometric head values and hydraulic conductivity using functions within GMS.  This will require total re-coding of the combined ARA-Vertek, PDA, and “handshake” programs into a single, seamless module controlled within WinOCPT.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to noncompetitively negotiate with American Association For Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), 5301 Buckeystown Pike, Frederick, MD 21704, to provide laboratory accreditation services. The proposed contract period will include the base year, October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005, with four one year option periods. The requirement is for the accreditation/certification of FSIS laboratories located in Athens, GA, St. Louis, MO, and Alameda, CA. The objectives are to assess each FSIS laboratory as follows: 1) is competent to perform specific tests; 2) maintains a quality system that addresses and conforms to all elements of ISO/IEC Standard 17025; 3) maintains the required documentation; 4) is operational. After completion of the assessment a written report of the assessor’s findings shall be submitted. Upon completion of a satisfactory assessment, the accrediting body shall provide a letter and certificates stating that the laboratory is in compliance with ISO/IEC Standard 17025 requirements as well as the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) International's "Accreditation Criteria for Laboratories Performing Food Microbiological and Chemical Analyses in Food, Feeds, and Pharmaceutical Testing" (ALACC). The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) is the sole assessment body possessing established cooperative arrangements with laboratory accreditation systems both internationally and in the United States. These arrangements facilitate the acceptance of test data between the A2LA-accredited laboratories and other countries, a critical element for FSIS laboratories regarding international equivalency and trade issues. These cooperative arrangements assure that FSIS laboratory data is recognized and accepted by these accrediting organizations and therefore the government in the countries that recognize the organization as an accrediting body. Examples of the cooperative arrangements include the Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation, the European Cooperation for Accreditation, The Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation and National Cooperation for Laboratory Accreditation (NACLA). NACLA is a U.S. accreditation body. These cooperative arrangements insure that the signatories agree to recognize the technical equivalency of each other's accreditations and therefore the data for the laboratories that they accredit is considered equivalent. This is not a request for competitive quotations. The Government anticipates conducting this acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures authorized under the test program in Subpart 13.5. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested concerns may submit a capability statement within 10 days after the posted date of this notice. All timely responses will be considered, however, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be addressed to the attention of the Contracting Officer referencing number SC-LQAD-5-01.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-bbg-5463
<RESPDATE>080204
<ARCHDATE>08172004
<CONTACT>Jim Sullivan, Senior Procurement Executive, Phone 202-619-3448, Fax 202-260-0855, Email sullivan@ibb.gov
<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a requirement for a contractor to provide specialized and timely non-personal expert “advisory and assistance” services, including analytical and research services as they may be required, to support the BBG in the performance of its entire worldwide multimedia broadcasting public diplomacy mission in the most effective, timely, and efficient manner practicable in a very competitive global marketplace.

The contractor must have recent pertinent experience in such functions as providing strategic (mid-term or long-term) and tactical (short-term) advice and assistance on planning, developing, testing, and evaluating unique radio programming, television (TV) programming, and other multimedia products, services, and methodologies (including but not limited to the effective use of computer technology in broadcasting and digital radio and television production techniques), as well as the use and development of programming on medium wave, FM, and shortwave broadcasting to attract substantial target audiences, as determined by the BBG.  The contractor may also be requested by the BBG to perform ad-hoc special projects and/or make special presentations to the BBG.

Because of the specialized nature (i.e., technical, business, cultural, logistical, and politica1 considerations) and the necessary timeliness of the contractor’s performance of the above-stated expert “advisory and assistance” services in support of the BBG during their development and implementation of the BBG’s multimedia programming efforts, the BBG intends to non-competitively award a negotiated firm-fixed-price contract to Bert Kleinman Programming, Inc. (BKP) of Arlington, VA for this specialized work on the basis of BKP’s unique technical, business, and other qualifications and recent pertinent experience in radio, television, and multimedia news, information, and music programming for mass audiences, BKP’s known capability to successfully meet the BBG’s overall time schedule for its multimedia programming efforts, and BKP’s comprehensive international broadcasting qualifications and experience.  

The term of this proposed contract is for one base-year, with a single one-year option, subject to annual funding availability.  BKP is the only responsible source known to the BBG that has demonstrated in-depth specialized business and technical knowledge (including, but not limited to, the above-stated radio and TV methodologies), and current radio, television, and multimedia experience with mass audience programming that is critical to the contractor's ability to perform the above-summarized work in a high quality and timely manner for the BBG.  Such unique BKP capability is due, in part, to BKP’s experience in dealing with the BBG and other organizations in addressing complex radio, television, and multimedia program planning, development, and implementation issues, including the Middle East and Russia.  

The Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this proposed procurement is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2), 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(l), that states: “When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.”  This Public Notice of the BBG’s intent to non-competitively procure BKP’s expert advisory and assistance services is NOT a request for competitive price quotations or proposals.  

However, other interested individuals or firms may express to the U.S. Government their interest in and detailed capabilities to perform the above-stated non-personal expert advisory and assistance services.  Any such written expressions of interest AND accompanying detailed written statements of existing technical, business, and other capabilities must be received by the Government (BBG) Contracting Officer (CO) within fifteen (15) calendar days of the GSA’s publication of this Public Notice in order to be considered.  Oral or incomplete submissions will not be accepted by the Government.  A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement, based upon any responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received from interested persons or firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

Any submissions or questions regarding this Public Notice shall be made in writing to the Government (BBG) Contracting Officer (CO), Jim Sullivan, via E-mail at sullivan@ibb.gov, and the interested person or firm making the submission and/or asking the question shall confirm the BBG-CO’s receipt of any such submissions and/or questions by telephonically contacting the BBG-CO at (202) 619-3448.  This Public Notice is not a RFQ, RFP, or IFB.

ORCA is part of the Federal-wide Business Partner Network (BPN) and can be found at http://www.bpn.gov/.  Click on VENDOR under ORCA on the left side of the screen to submit your information. The SF 330 Part II is Question 26 in ORCA; the preceding questions must also be answered.  Firms must first have a DUNS Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system.  (CCR can be also be ac cessed from the BPN website.)  Firms will also need their Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) generated from CCR to access ORCA.  The information submitted through ORCA is available, in a read-only format, to the public.  Part II is prepared on a branch office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF 330 Part II to ORCA is voluntary.

The information submitted to ORCA is available to the public.  Do not submit a SF 254 or a SF 330 Part II to the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).  ACASS will be modernized in late 2004 to r etrieve the SF 330 Part II data from ORCA and make it available to contracting agencies.  Until then, agencies will typically require A-E firms to submit Parts II with Part I when responding to a solicitation of A-E services.  A Part II is required for eac h branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if  a firm has one on file in ORCA.  You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at 503-808-4590, or by e-mail at caic.nwp@nwp01.usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This acquisition represents the initial procurement by DSCP-HROE for the Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) for the acquisition of the 15 SPEK Kits.  The SPEK was created to satisfy the Air Force’s requirement for a rapidly deployable, temporary kitchen for use in remote and undeveloped locations.  This item will not be stocked.  All orders will be issued as FOB Destination.  CONUS order will be shipped DVD.  OCONUS orders will be shipped to a Depot in order to be forwarded to the overseas location.

The SPEK is a complete food service facility capable of providing hot meals to 300 personnel at a time.  It was created to satisfy the Air Force’s requirement for rapidly deployable, temporary kitchen for use in remote and undeveloped locations.  The SPEK can be deployed by air or ground transportation.  Everything but fuel, water and food is packed onto a single air cargo pallet.  The entire SPEK can be set up by eight airmen in less than two hours and requires a four-person crew to operate the equipment and serve the food.  Testing has shown the SPEK to exceed the standard of feeding Unitized Group Rations to 300 airmen twice a day in two hours.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Bid date & time unchanged. CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS 1.	The Voice and Data Portion of this Quote QUESTION: “Since VA is terminating horizontal wire themselves, are we to furnish jacks and faceplates?” ANSWER: “All jacks and faceplates are furnished and installed by the VA.” QUESTION: “What are the feed requirements between closets (fiber and copper) and are we to furnish materials for VA to terminate?” ANSWER: “See Revised Drawing 18.D5.1, included in Amendment No.2, for Feeder requirements.  Also refer to the Specifications for additional information.” QUESTION: “Can you clarify the feed (counts) from other building to new closet and witch closet it is?” ANSWER: “See Revised Drawing 18.D5.1, included in Amendment No.2, for Feeder requirements.  Also refer to the Specifications for additional information.” 2.	Fire alarm system for section 13850 QUESTION: “Drawing 18.E3.1 show single station smoke detectors with sounder base, single station smoke detector with sounder base and strobe, mini-horns and ceiling horn/strobes, yet there is no mention of functionality of those devices within specification section 13850. Furthermore, there is no reference on drawing 18.E4.1 to indicate if these are connected to the fire alarm control panel. Are the single station smoke detectors to be monitored by the fire alarm control panel or are these to be stand alone 120 VAC connected? Is it the intent to connect the ceiling horn/strobe and mini-horns to the fire alarm control panel?” ANSWER: “Single-station Smoke Detectors are to be EST-compatible, addressable, and monitored by the Fire Alarm Control Panel.  Panel is shown on Drawing 18.E3.1.  This panel is to be connected to the existing Main EST Panel, located in the campus Boiler Plant, via the Base Loop System.  Ceiling Horn/Strobe devices and Mini-Horn devices are to be connected to the Fire Alarm Control Panel.” QUESTION: “Rooms 142 and 144 do not show any fire alarm devices. Is this an oversight? If fire alarm devices are to be located in these rooms please indicate what devices are to be located and whether they are to be connected to the fire alarm control panel.” ANSWER: “Rooms 142 and 144 are to receive Fire Alarm devices similar to those shown in typical Patient Bedrooms.  Revised Drawing 18.E3.1, included in Amendment No.2, correctly shows these devices.  Single-station Smoke Detectors are to be EST-compatible, addressable, and monitored by the Fire Alarm Control Panel.  Ceiling Horn/Strobe devices and Mini-Horn devices are to be connected to the Fire Alarm Control Panel.” QUESTION: “Are there any duct smoke detectors in this project?” ANSWER: “No.  There are no Duct-Mounted Smoke Detectors in this Project.” QUESTION: “Door holders are not shown on drawing 18.E3.1. Please confirm if door holders are included in this project.” ANSWER: “ There are no Electronic Door Holders in this Project.” QUESTION: “Smoke detectors are not located in the corridor structure of the office area of the building. Please confirm if this was intended to be designed as such” ANSWER: “No.  Smoke Detectors are not required in the Office area (CWT area).” 3.	Specifications 10800 QUESTION: “Paragraph 2.12 calls for the toilet Tissue Dispenser to be manufactured by Gabriel Service and Supply Company.  That is not a manufacturer of any Toilet Tissue Dispensers; it is a distributor we think.  Could you please forward us contact information so we can talk to them?  They are not listed in the Internet or in the yellow pages” ANSWER:  “See Amendment No.4 for revised Section 10800, Paragraph 2.12.” 4.	Bidder’s List QUESTION: “I have a bid announcement for the Transplant Lodger Building in Vancouver Washington, which has a listing for some underpinning work.  Can you tell me the best way to find out more information, look at the plans and specs and get a copy of a planholders list of the potential general contractors bidding on this job?” ANSWER:  “Go to website http://www.bos.oamm.va.gov/cgi-bin/WebObjects/BosPublic.woa  Select Find a solicitation Enter solicitation number 648-53-04 Go to bottom of screen and push 648-53-04 Wait while downloads information Go to bottom of screen – select View Solicitation Mailing List” 5.

See 18.E0.1.” 6.	Fire Alarm and Telephone/Data Systems QUESTION: “Reference dwg #E3.1: Is continuous conduit raceway system required for the Fire Alarm system?” ANSWER: “Yes.  Per Specification Section 13850, Paragraph 3.1A, all Fire Alarm wiring is to be installed in conduit.” QUESTION: “Reference dwg #E3.1: Is ‘Convergint Technologies’ the only approved Fire Alarm contractor?” ANSWER: “Yes, to the best of our knowledge ‘Convergint Technologies’ is the is the only approved Fire Alarm contractor.  They perform the programming.” QUESTION: “Reference dwg #E3.1: Is continuous conduit raceway system required for the TEL/COM system?” ANSWER: “Per Drawing 18.E0.1, the combination Telephone/Data symbol indicates that the Contract includes conduit to the accessible ceiling.” QUESTION: “Reference Spec 16781: Is the MATV system specified to be furnished and installed by the electrical contractor?” ANSWER: “This system is specified in Division 16, so it is typically included in the work performed by the prime Electrical contractor or one of their subcontractors.  All work specified in this Section is to be included in the Bid submitted to the VA by the General Contractor; the source of the Bid for this work is to be determined solely by the General Contractor.” QUESTION: “Reference detail 5/D4.2: Feeders 2003 and 5003 shown on the new PMP-2 one-line are not defined in the schedule, please clarify.” ANSWER: “Revised Drawing 18.E4.2, included in Amendment No.2, correctly identifies these Feeders as ‘2004’ and ‘5004’, respectively.

See the ‘Mechanical Schedule’ and the ‘Mechanical Equipment Connection Schedule’ on Drawing D4.1 for additional information.” QUESTION: “Reference detail 6/E4.1: Feeder 3503 shown on the one-line is not defined in the schedule, please clarify.” ANSWER: “Revised Drawing 18.E4.1, included in Amendment No.2, correctly identifies this Feeder as ‘3803’.  This Feeder is identified in the Feeder Schedule included with Detail 6/E4.1.” 7.	Fire Alarm System: QUESTION: “Drawing 18.E4.1 detail 7 shows no connection to the base loop system.  This clearly needs to be indicated as the new panel for this building will be connected to the existing base loop system and incorporated into the existing EST3 Fire Alarm Network.” ANSWER:  “See Amendment No.4.” QUESTION: “Drawing 18.D5.1 shows new conduit interconnected to the existing FA Loop Box near the sidewalk.  However, upon investigation with Chip Dryer at VA Vancouver, it appears that this is the old abandoned base loop system and it is not clear how the base loop system is to be re-configured for the new building.  What is necessary is a revision to this drawing clearly indicating how the base loop is to be re-configured for the new building.” ANSWER:  “See Amendment No.4.” 8.  Correct Door Schedule: QUESTION: Amendment 2, par. 45 deleted and replaced the Section 08000 Door Schedule. The posted door schedule under Amendment 2 on your website is still dated as 5/7/04, not 6/8/04, and there aren't any apparent revisions. What am I missing? ANSWER:  The new one still has the old date on it (in the upper left corner of each page), but the tile of the Schedule clearly reads: "DOOR AND FRAME SCHEDULE - REVISED 6/8/04".  Also, there are clear differences between the new schedule and the original, the most obvious being the addition of Note 4 in the "NOTES ON REMARKS COLUMN" on page one, and the addition of Note 4 in the "REMARKS" column of at least 30 of the doors throughout the schedule.

<DESC>SYNTHETIC MULTIFUNCTIONAL MATERIALS (SMFM), SOL BAA04-12, Addendum 7, DUE: 11/12/04.  POC: Dr. Leo Christodoulou, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 703-696-2374, Email: baa04-12@darpa.mil; Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dso0412. 

PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving proposals for research, development and proof-of-concept demonstrations of multifunctional materials and structures to realize new, revolutionary or unique capabilities of military utility.  The SMFM program seeks to advance materials capabilities by the integration of structural/mechanical attributes with other functionalities within a material system.  It aims to offer transformational options for achieving reduced weight, higher levels or unique performance, more flexibility in design, reduction of complexity and greater reliability.  The program intends to develop material systems that integrate structural/mechanical functions with one or more additional functions, e.g., power generation, self-repair/self-monitoring, sensing, actuation, communication, thermal management, ballistic and/or blast protection, signature management, catalytic/surface chemical activity, etc.  The specific objectives of this program are 1) the development and demonstration of synthetic multifunctional material systems; 2) the establishment of rules and tools for their design and use; and 3) the fabrication of demonstration articles and testing that clearly illustrate their revolutionary impact to the Department of Defense (DoD).  

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: 
All projects must identify a specific challenge problem that addresses the compelling DoD application and explicitly identify the multiple functions of the material or structure.  All projects must generate SMFM materials that achieve synergistic, not parasitic, combinations of properties; must design and synthesize efficient multifunctional structures in engineering-compatible time-frames; and must develop broadly applicable approaches, rules and tools for the design and use of multifunctional materials.   Approaches that extract and selectively exploit lessons from biology are encouraged.  Dynamic or adaptive material systems are of particular interest.  Integrated, multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts or teaming arrangements among industry, universities, federal laboratories, and users are also encouraged.  Since the emphasis of the program is on the development of structural material systems that are themselves multifunctional, structures composed of discrete components that require extensive externally supplied electrical power or communication, or command and control support (i.e., complex arrangements of sensors, actuators and control systems) to exhibit useful multifunctionalities are not of interest.

SUBMISSION OF WHITE PAPERS:
We invite white papers in response to this announcement.  Proposers are strongly encouraged (but are not required) to submit white papers in advance of full proposals.  The white papers should clearly describe the ultimate goal and multifunctionality attributes of the proposed SMFM system and specific quantitative milestones to be accomplished in the first eighteen (18) months.  The white papers should not exceed eight (8) pages in length, including the title page, all charts, figures and appendices.  The white papers should include an executive summary and cover the following topics: 1) the need, novelty, advantages and potential impact of the selected challenge problem to DoD; 2) the essence of the multifunctional material or structure clearly identifying its multiple functions and the underlying (postulated) operative physical mechanisms; 3) the uniqueness of the idea and its advantages over the state of the art; 4) the overall technical approach, including key challenges and how they will be addressed; 5) specific and quantitative milestone(s) that need to be achieved in order to demonstrate progress in reaching the ultimate goals of the program; 6) the potential for producing the materials or structures (one-of-a-kind demonstrations that cannot be made into a practical structure will not be acceptable); 7) a list of participants and their contributions; and 8) a chart showing tasks and the quantitative milestones along with a cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline by government fiscal year and task.  White papers sent in response to this addendum are due NO LATER THAN 1600 HOURS ET SEPTEMBER 13, 2004.  Recommendations for full proposal submission will be made within approximately thirty (30) days of that date.  DARPA reserves the right to request full proposals from any specific sections of any white paper submission and/or to encourage teaming between proposers and/or other entities.  To facilitate the submission of white papers, a website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been set up.  For more detailed instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to the instructions for BAA04-12 found at the website http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa04-12P1.htm. 

FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSALS:
In addition to the eight (8) categories in the white paper, each proposal must also 1) include at least two specific and quantitative yearly objectives for each scientific/technical task in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goal; 2) include clearly delineated intellectual property and material producibility arrangements; and 3) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other activities planned to facilitate qualification of the SMFM system and increase its readiness for transition into DoD platforms.

Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements may be required periodically.  A final demonstration of a deliverable SMFM material system is required.  Research programs should be no longer than 48 months and divided into at least two phases with specific and quantitative go/no go milestones at the end of Phase I.  Phase I should not exceed eighteen (18) months.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, teaming arrangements are highly encouraged.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Proposers may be required to brief their proposal to the DARPA Source Selection Committee.

Follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa04-12P2.htm.  To receive consideration under this addendum, PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT DARPA NO LATER THAN 1600 ET NOVEMBER 12, 2004.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA only.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a full proposal created with the requirements listed in this addendum and in accordance with the original BAA04-12 published.  Note: if the website is not used, please use the U.S. mail system at the address listed below or the BAA e-mail account. 

PROPOSAL EVALUATION:
Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA04-12.  For complete details on writing a full proposal, please see original FEDBIZOPPS solicitation, BAA04-12, http://darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CHANGE THE ACTION CODE FROM A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE TO A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) has interest and is seeking sources capable of providing information in terms of budgetary pricing for an analysis to be performed on future processing of currency in accordance with the Equipment Pricing Request, questions, and draft Conceptual Process Flow charts which are attached herein. All price quotes are for the performance of a cost analysis on future currency processing and are not obligations. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only.

The BEP is interested in a cost analysis. At this point, the BEP does not intend on purchasing any particular service, but would like to review service literature and pricing as part of a market research to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  All interested businesses are requested to submit written information and brochures, which will be reviewed by the agency. If pricing is available under GSA Schedule please provide the schedule number. A site visit will be held from September 7, 2004 through September 17, 2004. All interested parties must submit a list of all personnel who will attend the site visit with their Sources Sought Cost Estimate in order to ensure visitor access to this secure Government facility. All visiting personnel are reminded to bring a picture ID and to leave all cameras and recording devices at home as they are not permitted into this secure facility.

All information and brochures may be mailed to the BEP Office of Procurement, Attn: Christina Tayman, 14th and C Sts, S.W., Washington, DC 20228-0001 at (202) 874-3235 or faxed to (202) 874-2200.

<DESC>UPDATE******UPDATE*****UPDATE The solicitation, drawings, specifications, wage determination, and Addendum No. 1  have been uploaded to PIXs 7/16/2004. UPDATE*****UPDATE*****UPDATE The response date has been updated from 7/15/2004 to 8/16/2004. UPDATE*****UDATE******UPDATE The work consists of the ability to furnish all materials and perform all labor  required to provide power supply for Compression Aero Research Laboratory  (CARL) in facilities 20018E and 08185.  Project scope is to construct  underground cable ducts and provide new medium voltage cables to connect the  CARL test apparatus being relocated in Facility 20018E to the base power system  at substation C.  This work is supporting lab equipment installation.  It is  recommended that only a qualified electrical contractor with experience in this  specific type of work perform this task. The project includes associated  architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and  miscellaneous work.  Special requirements/concerns:  This project involves installing new concrete  encased duct banks in existing streets, and installing a new 15kV circuit from  Substation C to Building 20018E.  It is important that the work be completed  within the performance period without interruption, and that no unscheduled  power outages occur.  Traditionally, most medium voltage work has been done by  utilities.  It is vastly different from performing low voltage (120 or 480V)  commercial work.  The safety rules and the codes involved are completely  different for medium voltage systems versus low voltage systems.  Faults on  medium voltage systems are much more destructive physically, and much more  likely to result in death in case of accidental contact, therefore the  different rules.  Safety is the primary concern, and this work requires a very  specialized contractor with the proper experience. The estimated price range is between 250,000 to 500,000.  Period of performance  is 240 calendar days. NAICS CODE:  238210.  The size standard $12M. This is a  restricted procurement in accordance with the HUB Zone Act of 1997 (13 CFR  126), 15 U.S.C. 631 note.

If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the SAA anticipates release of a solicitation in August 2004. Telephone or e-mail requests for additional information will not be honored.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 03:  The list of attendees at the pre-proposal conference is herewith attached.  Further, vendors are advised as follows:  NOAA’s strategy of awarding Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) is an experimental approach that, after considering the responses, may result in (1) no BPA(s) being awarded; (2) award of BPA(s) with a term that is as short as one year; (3) award of BPA(s) as planned.  This decision will be based on an analysis of the perceived benefits to NOAA as well as Federal and Agency acquisition policy, regulation and procedure.   Regardless of this decision, NOAA reserves the right to award the first task order independent of the BPA.  Accordingly, prospective vendors are requested to submit a quotation for the first task order with pricing that reflects a base year with three one-year options.   In the event that a stand-alone order is awarded, the terms and conditions of the BPA associated with everything but its term will be included.     ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements with venders capable of providing short-term, project-based specific scientific and technical support.  During government fiscal year 2003, NOAA’s headquarters acquisition office acquired over $92 million worth of supplies and services to support the mission of the Ocean Service, Marine Fisheries Service, and Research Office.  Approximately 70% of the 1,200 transactions issued in 2003 were simplified acquisitions for services and supplies that directly support NOAA programs.  A portion of these simplified acquisitions were individual agreements for short-term (i.e., 6-12 months) technical and scientific services that required specialized skills to address a diverse range of projects that support programs and NOAA’s overall mission.  The type of projects include services to collect and analyze scientific data, creating, reviewing and revising scientific and technical plans and reports, reviewing program plans, procedures and results for compliance with pre-stated goals, building and sustaining coalitions among scientific and technical experts, implementing program plans, providing litigation support, and coordinating program/project actions among Federal, state and local governments as well as industry and citizen groups.  The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and scientific knowledge combined with detailed knowledge of NOAA’s mission, objectives and line office operating plans.  The following is a partial list of the types of labor that have previously been sought to work on short term projects:  physical oceanographer, coastal scientist, oceanographer, marine biologist, marine ecologist, environmental scientist, fishery biologist, and natural resource economist.   The level of experience can vary from junior level (graduate students) to principals and senior scientists.  NOAA’s mission, line offices and program objectives can be reviewed on its webpage: www.noaa.gov. 

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to create a more efficient process for acquiring and managing the scientific and technical support services described above, NOAA is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements to small businesses holding MOBIS Contracts (SIN 874) under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  The first task order to be placed against the BPA is also included with this announcement.  

Small businesses holding GSA MOBIS schedule contracts (SIN 874) who are interested in being considered for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the services described above should review the attached documents.  These documents include:  (1) A detailed Request For Quotation (RFQ-07_08_04); the prospective Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA 07_09_2004); and the first task order (BPA Task Order 0001).

<DESC>The University of Chicago, as the M&O contractor at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to operating and maintaining one or more of the utility systems at ANL. ANL consists of approximately 106 building on 1,700 acres and is located 25 miles south of Chicago, IL. Utility systems at ANL consist of a potable water storage and distribution system, a non-potable (canal) water treatment and distribution system, a laboratory water distribution system, a domestic wastewater collection and treatment system, a laboratory wastewater collection and treatment system, a steam generation and distribution system, an electrical distribution system, and a natural gas distribution system.  
PROCESS: In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the University of Chicago, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for this action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  SHOULD INTEREST BE DETERMINED SUFFICIENT, A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS MAY BE FORTHCOMING.  The Service Contract Act (SCA) will apply to any request for proposals issued. This requirement is unrestricted.  Small Business interests should note the FAR Part 19 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and Size Standards (SS) for the utility systems identified in this announcement.  Some, all, or any combination of the following may apply.  NAICS/SS:  221122/4 Million (M) Megawatt hours, 221210/500 employees, 221310/$6M, 221320/$6M, 221330/$10.5M.
OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this RFI is to determine the interest and feasibility of finding a contractor(s) to operate, inspect, maintain, and repair the utility system(s) located at ANL. The contractor(s) must furnish all labor, tools, confined space entry equipment, vehicles, and equipment necessary for the normal operation of the system(s) 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Contractor(s) must operate and maintain the facilities to meet all federal, state, and applicable DOE permits and regulations. 
POTABLE WATER STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: The Lab purchases potable water (also known as Lake Michigan water) from Dupage County Public Works.  The potable water for the Lab enters through the potable water metering station located inside building No. 127, which is located adjacent to the Fire Water Tank and the Domestic Water Treatment Plant, Building 129. The Water Treatment Plant, including two aeration tanks and a soft water well, was used to treat well water from four on-site wells prior to purchasing Lake Michigan water. The potable water flows through one of the two aeration tanks and the soft water well to the 500,000-gallon Fire Water Storage Tank using any one of the three low lift pumps. Four high lift pumps take suction out of the Fire Water Storage Tank and pump the potable water through the domestic water distribution system to the three elevated domestic water storage tanks.  The three elevated domestic water storage tanks maintain the pressure on the distribution system.  The combined capacity of the elevated storage tanks is 950,000 gallons.  The high lift pumps are operated in such a manner that proper water levels are maintained in all three domestic water storage tanks all the time and this assures proper pressure through out the distribution system. ANL purchased 184.6 million gallons of Lake Michigan water from the Dupage Water Commission in FY2003. ANL has four water wells that serve as a backup water source for the DuPage County Public Works Water Supply, if something caused a loss of water supply from the county. Maintenance of the four wells and the Domestic Water Treatment Plant, and operation, as necessary are in the scope of this effort. 
NON-POTABLE (CANAL) WATER TREATMENT AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: Canal water is used extensively as cooling water for refrigeration condensers, as makeup for cooling towers, and for programmatic experimental work.  Water is pumped from the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal by the Canal Water Pumping Station, which is located about 1 mile from the Lab on a separate piece of Lab-owned property. The Canal Pumping Station is equipped with a bar screen, a traveling screen, wet well and three low lift pumps, which transfer water from the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the Canal Water Treatment Plant.  At the Canal Water Treatment Plant there are two 45-foot diameter accelerators, each with a capacity of 1,500 gallons per minute.  The plant design capacity is 4,000,000 gallons-each plant is capable of 2,000,000 gallons  These accelerators are used to remove most of the suspended solids in the canal water after chemicals are added to enable coagulation, flocculation and precipitation of the suspended solids in the raw canal water. Normal flow through the Canal Water Treatment Plant ranges from 280 to 350 gpm, but can peak at 700 to 900 gpm. These are seasonal flows. The sludge from the accelerators is pumped from the Canal Water Treatment Plant Sludge Lift Station to the Laboratory Wastewater Treatment Plant.
Clarified water is pumped from the accelerators to the ground level 500,000 gallon Canal Cooling Water Reservoir Tank and on to the 228,000 gallon elevated Canal Water Storage Tank using one of the three high lift pumps located at the Canal Water Treatment Plant.  The Canal Water Storage Tank provides the necessary head to the canal water distribution system to enable it to supply canal water to all buildings and locations at the Lab that use canal water. All the canal water distribution main pipelines were replaced in 1987 and 1988.
NON-POTABLE (LABORATORY) WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: The Laboratory Water Distribution System uses potable water from the potable water system.  The 500,000 gallon elevated potable water storage tank fills with an Altitude Valve.  There is an air gap between the two systems.  When the water level in the potable water storage tank is too low to enable gravity flow to the Laboratory Water Storage Tank, a booster pump will engage and transfer potable water through the same line and air gap.  The Laboratory Water Distribution System serves all the buildings with laboratories in order to prevent any possibility of backflow of contaminants from a working laboratory into the Potable Water Distribution System.  
DOMESTIC WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT SYSTEM: Sanitary wastewater is collected across the entire ANL site from all buildings and facilities that generate sanitary wastewater. The sanitary collection system consist of six sanitary lift stations and associated forced mains, along with the underground sanitary gravity sewers and manholes, which transport the sanitary wastewater to the Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
The Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Plant is a secondary biological trickling filter plant with Imoff Clarigester type primary and secondary clarifiers.  The treatment plant is split into two independent treatment trains. The plant is designed for a peak of 1,000,000 gallons and has an average of 350-400,000 gallons per day. A DuPage County Public Works wastewater tanker truck comes to Building # 576 and removes the sludge (about 6,000 gallons) from the sludge holding tank about every six weeks at about the same time the sludge is removed from the digester portion of the Clarigester.  The sludge is hauled to the DuPage County Public Works Wastewater Treatment Plant for disposal.
The secondary effluent flows through intermittent sand filters and then is monitored for compliance with the NPDES Permit for this outfall.  It is then mixed with the effluent from the Laboratory Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The combined flow from the two treatment plants passes through the old chlorine contact tank (no longer used), then through the Monitoring Building and to the final monitoring point where the combined effluent is monitored to ensure compliance with the NPDES Permit for this outfall. The combined effluent discharges into Sawmill Creek.
LABORATORY WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT SYSTEM: Laboratory wastewater is collected across the entire ANL Site from all the buildings and facilities that generate laboratory wastewater, as well as from the Canal Water Treatment Plant Sludge Lift Station.  There are three laboratory wastewater lift stations that are used for the collection and pumping of laboratory wastewater for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) Facilities.  The laboratory wastewater collection system consist of these three laboratory wastewater lift stations and their associated forced mains, along with the Canal Water Treatment Plant Sludge Lift Station and its associated forced main and all of the  underground laboratory wastewater gravity flow sewers and manholes, which transport the laboratory wastewater to the Laboratory Wastewater Treatment Plant.  There are five additional lift stations serving the Boiler House area including the equalization pond that are included in this scope. 
The Laboratory Wastewater Treatment Plant is a physical/chemical wastewater treatment plant that utilizes chemical addition to provide and enhance coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation to separate suspended solids from the laboratory wastewater.  The treatment process utilizes alum and a cationic polymer as the coagulants.  Solids contact clarifiers are used to physically separate the suspended solids from the laboratory wastewater.  The plant is designed for 1,100,000 gallons; the average flow through the Laboratory Wastewater Treatment Plant is in the range of 400,000 gallons per day.  Sludge is dumped into a roll off container and later hauled to a landfill for final disposal. When the water leaves the solids contact clarifiers it is sampled for compliance with the NPDES Permit parameters for this outfall.  The clarified laboratory wastewater effluent then combines with the effluent from the Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The combined flow from the two treatment plants passes through the old chlorine contact tank (no longer used), then through the Monitoring Building and to the final monitoring point where the combined effluent is monitored to ensure compliance with the NPDES Permit for this outfall. The combined effluent discharges into Sawmill Creek.
STEAM GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: Steam is produced in the Boiler House (Building 108) and distributed across ANL utilizing a steam distribution piping system to all the buildings on site that require steam.  Approximately 90% to 95% of the steam is used for comfort heating and for hot water heaters; a small amount is used for programmatic experiments. The original equipment in the Boiler House is late 1940s vintage, but has been well maintained. Steam is produced as saturated 190 to 200 psig using water tube boilers. The Boiler House has four 85,000 pound per hour boilers (#1 through #4) that use only natural gas as the fuel supply and one 170,000 pound per hour boiler (#5) that can utilize coal or natural gas as the fuel supply.  The steam load for the Boiler House varies from a low of around 40,000 pounds per hour in the summer months to a high in the winter months of around 250,000 pounds per hour.  During the winter months, #5 boiler is operated using coal as the fuel supply; however, the site is only allowed to burn 12,000 tons of coal a year.  For this reason #5 boiler can only be operated on coal for about five months a year.  85% of the steam condensate is returned to the Boiler House steam condensate storage tanks and used as boiler feedwater.  The balance of boiler feedwater is made up with purchased water that is treated with water treatment equipment and chemicals inside the Boiler House to produce the required boiler feedwater makeup. Boiler feedwater makeup water requirements range from 40 gpm to 100 gpm depending on the time of year.
Steam is furnished to the ANL site through two main steam lines from two export steam headers located inside the Boiler House.  All five steam boilers are capable of discharging steam into both main export steam headers through non-return steam valves.  The majority of the steam distribution system is aboveground.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: Natural gas is provided from off-site by Northern Illinois Corporation (NICOR Gas) under contract with the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC).  Gas is delivered by NICOR at 150 psig to a pressure-reducing station outside the Boiler House, Bldg. 108. The pressure-reducing station is owned and operated by NICOR.  The gas pressure is reduced from 150 psig to 53 psig before it is piped into the Boiler House.  Inside the Boiler House a 4-inch line branches off to supply the Lab through the natural gas distribution system, and a main header feeds the five boilers.  Each of the five boilers receives natural gas at a further reduced pressure of 15 psig through another pressure reducing valve.  The Lab natural gas distribution system operates at 10 psig after pressure is reduced from 53 psig in another pressure reducing valve outside the Boiler House.  The main natural gas distribution pipelines across the Lab are 4 inch, 3 inch, and 2 inch. The main natural gas distribution lines were replaced across the Argonne site about three years ago with PE-2406 polyethylene pipe, schedule 40.  At the building interfaces the pipe materials change from PE-2406 to carbon steel pipe.  The natural gas pressure is reduced again from 10 psig to 6 ounces of pressure before it enters any of the buildings where it is used.
ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM: Electricity is purchased under contract by the DESC and transmitted to the site through the Commonwealth Edison system. Commonwealth Edison brings the electricity to the Lab at 138 KV where it is transformed to 13.2 KV for distribution around the Lab, and further transformed down to 4160 V in some areas.  The ANL electrical system includes three major substations and two smaller substations that deal with the overall distribution of electricity for the Lab, but there are other substations that handle electrical distribution for specific areas of the Lab.  Distribution lines are a mixture of overhead and underground.  Emergency power generators are not included in this scope except at Bldg 108, The Steam Plant.

<CONTACT>Joy Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-882-6180, Fax null, Email joy.smith@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) seeks innovative solutions for the next-generation of infrared (IR) sensors. The goal is to obtain advanced IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) with greater sensitivity, large FPA format, high uniformity, reduced noise, and improved resolution to permit target detection, tracking, and discrimination at long ranges for both high background such as boost-phase, and low background such as midcourse with cold objects. Consideration should be given to new or revived IR materials that have the potential to achieve high performance with cutoff wavelengths covering the whole spectrum of IR, especially with the ability to extend to >15 microns cutoff, very large format, and operating at temperatures >35K. Material systems to be developed should be manufacturable, producible, and therefore potentially low cost. Multicolor capability is also an important factor. Ideas solicited include, but are not limited to, innovations in Type-II Strain Layer Superlattice (SLS), high efficiency Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIP), HgCdTe grown on Si substrate, and Pb salt.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain industry concepts and market information for the aforementioned IR FPA development.  This RFI does not, in any way constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) and as such, is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for information/items provided in response to this RFI.  A follow-on RFP/solicitation does not exist at this time.  If a follow-on RFP is required, MDA will modify Broad Agency Announcement # HQ0006-04-MDA-BAA entitled, “Missile Defense Agency Broad Agency Announcement for Advanced Systems”.  Responses shall include two sections.  The first section shall include information identifying the company, point-of-contact, corporate capabilities and experience in less than three (3) pages in relation to the following criteria: (1) The prime contractor must be a United States Corporation or business entity; (2) Demonstration of Relevant Experience with IR materials; single device and small test arrays; large format, high operability, high quality FPAs; and sensors including ROIC and electronics; and (3) Past Performance References (Government or commercial) for this type of work within the last 5 years.  All experience submitted must be relevant.  The second section shall include the description of your technology, and technical and management approach in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate the innovation and potential outcome of the approach.  The technical section is limited to ten (10) pages.  All respondents are required to adhere to  U.S export control laws (e.g. Arms Export Control Act (as amended) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations).  Responses to this notice must be received on or before August 16, 2004, electronically to the point of contact listed below or via mail to Missile Defense Agency, Attn: MDA/CTV-Joy Smith, 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington DC 20301-7100.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure on a sole source basis to Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern, Pennsylvania for the installation of a 3.0 Tesla XMR system initially purchased from Siemens.  This requirement will be obtained through a modification to NIH Contract Number N02-HL-3-4214 with Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. for a  “3 Tesla Interventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging System”.  It is believed that Siemens is the sole source for this requirement based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this program is to support the collaborative research program between Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and NIH to study the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the clinical evaluation of novel interventional methods in cardiac MRI.  Over the last several years, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH has been developing new MRI techniques for the evaluation of cardiac patients.  NHLBI installed an interventional 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner in the Cardiology Branch to perform clinical evaluations of these methodologies.  This contract provides turn-key installation of a novel 3 Tesla Interventional MRI system.  The installation of this unique system will require the coupling of a 3.0 Tesla MRI system with a X-ray catheter table capable of transporting a custom designed patient bed between the MRI system and the X-ray fluoroscopy system.  Successful operation of the system will be dependent on precise engineering required to smoothly integrate the transport system for the X-ray table into the operation of the 3.0 Tesla scanner.  The transport system is a unique custom designed mechanism built by Siemens and composed of rails and a rolling patient table.  The rails must be installed within an RF shielded enclosure.  All electronic connections and power sources for the system must be compatible with an RF shielded environment.  Modification of the computer room of the site will be required to install the new electronic components associated with both the 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner and the X-ray fluoroscopy table.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten (10) calendar days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

 POSITION TITLE:  Senior Program Manager
 MARKET VALUE:  EQUIVALENT GS 15 – Range ($87,439 - $113,674)
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 4 years
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  USAID-BOGOTA, Colombia
 SECURITY ACCESS:  SECRET LEVEL
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: ECONOMIC UNIT
 
 
  POSITION DESCRIPTION
 

 
 As a USAID employee, the incumbent carries responsibility to understand and incorporate the Agency's five core values in all aspects of his/her work. These core values are: 1. Customer focus 2. Results orientation, 3. Empowerment and accountability, 4.Teamwork and participation, and 5. Valuing Diversity.
 
 BACKGROUND:
 
 Colombia –   Colombia, Latin America’s oldest formal democracy, is threatened by narcotics trafficking, guerilla and paramilitary violence, human rights abuses, corruption, crime, and a lack of effective government presence in over half of the countryside.  The volatile mix of armed insurgency and drug cultivation and trafficking, seriously threatens U.S. national interests and foreign policy goals for democracy, reduced illicit drug exports to the U.S., and regional peace and stability.
 
 Since September 2000, the U.S. Government has provided Colombia with over $2.4 billion in support of Colombian efforts to achieve peace and economic prosperity and to strengthen the state.  Colombia is the third largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid in the world after Iraq and Afghanistan.  There are nearly a dozen other USG agencies at post, and frequent high-level congressional and other delegations.  USAID/Colombia is the highest-profile, most politically sensitive program in the LAC Bureau portfolio, with an FY 2004 OYB of more than $120 million.  The USAID program addresses the major social, political and economic development challenges resulting from Colombia’s decades-old guerilla insurgency and large-scale production and trafficking of illicit drugs that help finance the operations of terrorist and extremist groups.
 
 The conflict has led to the displacement of more that 2.5 million people, the second largest displaced population in the world.  Assassinations, kidnappings, extortion and bombings are everyday occurrences in Colombia.  Because of the sustained, high level of violence, insecurity and crime throughout the country and direct threats against the U.S. Embassy and staff in Bogota, Colombia is a danger pay, hardship post.  USAID/Colombia has a staff of 73, including 11 U.S. direct hire employees, 9 U.S. personal services contractors, 3 third country nationals, and 50 Foreign Service nationals.
 
 The Economics Unit serves as the senior advisory unit to the U.S. Mission (the U.S. Ambassador, USAID Mission Director, and USG Country Team), on economic policy/institutional reform issues impacting on the achievement of USG strategic interests in Colombia, with particular focus on issues impacting trade/investment integration, employment, agricultural growth, alternative development, and government efficiency.  The Economist Unit leads the U.S. Mission dialogue with key USG/Washington institutions, including the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and with USAID Andean Missions on priority economic reform and regional economic integration issues facing Colombia within the context of the recently initiated Free Trade Agreement negotiations for Colombia.
 
 The Economics Unit also plays a strategic role in USG efforts to lead policy dialogue in economic reform-related areas with the Colombian Government and private sector; and with the IMF, World Bank, IDB and the rest of the bilateral donor community.  By attending donor meetings and providing critical advice directly to the U.S. Ambassador, USAID Mission Director and the rest of the Country Team, the Economics Unit effectively fosters and promotes USG national policy interests in Colombia. 13. BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION:
 
 The USAID/Colombia Senior Program Manager will serve as USAID/Colombia’s program planner and manager for all trade/investment-related economic policy and administrative reform support programs in Colombia.  These activities will in turn promote the establishment of a sound trade/investment policy environment and a strong public/private partnership program focus, in a manner which facilitates a buoyant response by the Colombian private sector to economic growth opportunities associated with the economic liberalization process.  These crucial  program strategy design activities will be carried out within the context of ongoing and path-breaking Free Trade Agreement negotiations between the US. and Colombia.
 
 Economic policy reform and trade/investment promotion represents a major component of USAID/Colombia’s overall support program for Colombia. Progress in this area is crucial to the sustainable transition of Colombia to a prosperous country free of narco-terrorism influences.  Program management responsibilities will include the identification of the major economic reforms required to establish a trade and investment-related policy and institutional environment conducive to macroeconomic stability and private sector-led growth in local and foreign private investment.  Also included will be direct management of the prioritization, planning and implementation of trade and investment-related economic policy and institutional reform-related technical support programs and activities; the maintenance of an active dialogue with senior public sector officials and local and international business leaders on the development of key economic policy and institutional reforms to facilitate trade/investment expansion; and on strategies and initiatives  for establishing innovative private/public partnership financing mechanisms designed to stimulate trade/investment flows; strategic guidance and managerial oversight of any equity fund support program developed by USAID/Colombia; the development and management of targeted dissemination programs designed to build the capacity of important segments of the public to better understand the opportunities and challenges associated with an FTA; and efforts to expand the understanding of key private sector groups regarding the importance of, and core defining elements of, the trade/investment integration process.
 
 Additionally, specific responsibility resides with this position for the identification and development of opportunities to link up cross-cutting corporate social responsibility-related initiatives to USAID country strategy and programs.  In this regard the position will play the lead role within the Mission on defining and facilitating the effective implementation of a cohesive corporate social responsibility support strategy.  These efforts will be designed to promote the extension and sustainability of key mission economic development and democratization objectives, by establishing a strong base of private sector financial and institutional support for critical job and income creation and social welfare enhancement initiatives which are tied to Mission objectives and programs.  This will in turn entail the innovative design and management of joint coordination/cooperation efforts between USAID/Colombia SO Teams and both local and international NGO’s and businesses in defining and executing these programs.  The end result should be a significant improvement in the sustainability of critical Mission development programs at the national and regional level.
 
 In short, the Senior Program Manager will oversee all aspects of the planning and implementation of economic policy and institutional reform-related support strategies and programs tied to trade/investment promotion for USAID in Colombia. Given the high visibility and level of concern for USG activities to restore sustainable economic vitality to a country which is clearly established as the regional lynchpin in the USG fight against narco-terrorism in the Andean Region, the Senior Program Manager will lead presentations, site visits, and dialogue with high level USG representatives and trade/investment promotion officials, as well as with senior representatives of the local and international business community.  In addition to program management responsibility, the Senior Program Manager will provide expert technical and policy advice regarding USG support to trade and investment-related economic reform/reactivation programs in Colombia.
 
 As a senior level advisor, the Senior Program Manager will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction, and will make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.  He/she will report frequently to senior Mission management, via the Chief of the Economics Unit.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process. NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.

All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  A statement that says, “Yes, this product meets this criteria” is not sufficient; please provide details as to how the product meets the criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.

Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact Sandra Perkins, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-4958.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract and the anticipated contract award date. The VHA Dental User Group, a group of VA dentists who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.  **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Mark Volin, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN AUGUST 13, 2004.

SCOPE OF WORK,                              SIMS BAYOU REACH 7.   1.0.	General.   The work consists of channel excavation, backfill, storm drains, articulated concrete blocks, metal and PVC sheet piling, relief wells, piezometers, sub-drainage system, storm drains, roads, fencing, hike and bike trail bridge, painting, and landscaping. This construction project includes dewatering and control of water from artesian and surface flows, managing unstable slopes due to silt deposits and slickensided soils, constructing Articulating Concrete Block (ACB) lined channels, installing steel sheetp ile, and building a pedestrian bridge.  The contractor will be required to coordinate with the local sponsor, as the local sponsor is replacing 3 highway bridges throughout this reach concurrently with construction on the bayou.  The contractor will also b e required to minimize site erosion and comply with all governing environmental regulations. 2.0. Geotechnical Considerations.   Sims Bayou is located on the Texas Coastal Plain and flows over the Beaumont clay formation from its headwaters to its junction with Buffalo Bayou.  The geology of the region consists of clay, silt, sand and gravel from upstream sources spread over the reg ion as the courses of the streams shifted laterally over the nearly featureless coastal plain.  This geologic formation has created some significant problems for construction along Sims Bayou:  artesian uplift, heavy storm runoff, silt deposits, and slicke nsided clay.   2.1 Artesian and Surface Water.   Significant artesian uplift, accompanied by si gnificant volumes of water, exists beneath Sims Bayou and has been the cause of sloughing of channel slopes on previous channelization work.  This artesian uplift poses problems during dewatering for channel excavation and for the excavation itself.  Very clean, poorly graded sand (SP) has been identified beneath the proposed channel invert.  This sand ranges in thickness to about 20 feet.  The artesian uplift reaches a few feet above the top of the proposed maintenance berm.  Relief wells are required to r elieve uplift for the finished channel and for dewatering and control of water during construction.  The dewatering and control of water features for the construction of Sims Bayou Channel Rectification are among the most complex ever used on a Corps project and requires the ability to effectively control water through the combination of diversion channel s and pumps.  This complexity is due partially to heavy rains.  Annual mean flow rates are less than 100 cfs, but urbanized hydrologic conditions result in spiked storm runoff events, which often exceed the capacity of practical diversion channels.  Peak f low rates recorded during Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001 were 9,030 cfs at the USGS gage at Hiram Clarke and 25,800 cfs at the USGS gage at Telephone Road. 2.2 Soil Conditions.   Isolated deposits of silt have been identified at various locations along Sims Bayou.  This silt can become very unstable when exposed along an excavated channel slope.  Slope failures at these locations are possible.  Considerable care must be taken durin g construction to properly identify silt deposits in order to effectively install the sand filter and geotextile over the silt to prevent piping and loss of the silt. The Beaumont clay is riddled with slickensides, which are smoothed surfaces along planes of weakness.  These slickensides are built-in failure planes for slope slides and sloughing.  This slickensided nature of the in situ clays can also cause concern duri ng channel excavation. 3.0. Structural Considerations.   The structural construction consists of reinforced concrete channel linings, concrete lateral linings, steel sheetpiling, reinforced concrete lined fishpond areas, a pedestrian bridge and foundation abutments, and a reinforced concrete junction box and lin ing for a realignment of an 84-inch CMP pipe entering the channel.   A pilot channel is to be constructed within an (ACB) channel.  ACB termination structures will be placed upstream and downstream of the Almeda Bridge to allow an optional bid item for the  relocation of the Almeda Bridge.   3.1 Cutoff Walls.   A steel sheetpile (SSP) cutoff wall with 200 feet of concrete lining downstream and 200 feet of riprap upstream is located at the upstream end of the project. The steel sheetpiling is approximately 6100 SF of large size PZ sections ranging in lengths from 15 to 40 feet with embedment depths of up to approximately 27 feet.  A diversion channel must be maintained through the wall during construction.  The 2,150 CY concrete lining at this cutoff wall will have a 4-foot deep exterior grade beam around the perim eter of the slab.  A 10-foot long scour cutoff SSP wall is constructed at the juncture of the slab and the ACB for all liner termination.    An existing SSP cutoff wall is located at the downstream end of this project.  There is an option in this project to remove this wall.  Six laterals require construction of 10-foot deep cutoff walls in conjunction with the ACB linings at the upstream ends of the lateral channels 3.2 Highway, Railroad and Pedestrian Bridges.   Construction of 10-inch concrete lined channel below existing highway and railroad bridges in multiple locations is required.  SSP cutoff walls will be used at the upstream and downstream ends of the channel lining.  The contractor must be able to construc t suitable construction joint locations to prohibit slab cracking.  All in channel slabs have a subdrainage system consisti ng of weepholes, PVC pipe, sand filter layers, filter fabric, and geotextile linings.   A 55-foot span prefabricated metal bridge pedestrian bridge and foundation will be constructed to span a lateral.   The foundation for this pedestrian bridge is a spread footing and is 8 feet wide to meet requirements similar to the remainder of the trails  on the Sims Bayou.  Procurement and installation of the bridge will be part of the contract. 3.3 In-channel Concrete Ponds.   The project includes the construction of four in channel concrete lined pond areas requiring 7,200 CY of concrete.  The slabs for these ponds are 24 inches thick in the central portions.  Ten-foot deep SSP scour cutoff walls will be installed at the concre te/ACB juncture at the upstream and downstream end of these ponds.    The contractor must have the ability to control shrinkage and temperature during the placement of these slabs.   3.3 Relocation of 84-inch Diameter CMP. An existing 84-inch diameter CMP discharges into the Sims channel from a sewer treatment plant.  Approximately 122 lineal feet of this pipe will be rerouted to enter the channel below the maintenance berm elevation.  To accommodate this, a juncture box has  been designed which consists of 14-inch, cast in place, reinforced concrete walls.  The construction will require a diversion channel or pipe to maintain flows (maximum of 80 million gallons per day) during the construction.   The contractor shall design the excavation and diversion piping for diversion.  The excavation will be over 20 feet deep and requires an experienced contractor in deep excavations to accomplish the diversion and construction of this pipe.    4.0. Laterals and Articulated Concrete Blocks (ACBs).   The channel and its tributaries will be protected by the installation of ACBs, which are placed by hand and then strung together by cables.  This type of installation requires a great deal of skill and knowledge in order that the installation progresses in  a manner that minimizes the exposure of unprotected erosive soils.  The ACBs are installed in areas that are subject to the sudden inundation of flood waters, which requires experience in phasing construction activities appropriately.  The ACBs are laid u pon a geotextile fabric to prevent the loss of material beneath the blocks but will yet function to relieve groundwater pressure.  In order for the Contractor to complete the work within the specified construction time the Contractor must effectively sched ule and progress block placement in conjunction with excavation, dewatering, sand bed placement, geotextile and storm drain pipe installation. 4.1 Storm Drainage Structures.   The work involves the excavation of backslope ditches and the construction of numerous drainage structures to handle sheet flow along the bayou.  The construction of the ditches and structures will be done in adverse working conditions where vehicle and eq uipment access is not easily accessible and wet conditions requiring pumping are a frequent occurrence.   4.2	Environmental Controls.   The Contractor shall institute environmental controls to minimize the lost of soil which would otherwise affect water quality downstream of the work area.  The Contractor will be required to phase construction and install temporary controls to minimize ero sion, sediment run-off, and dust.  All State, Federal and local environmental regulations shall be adhered too.  A detailed pollution prevention plan shall be developed and executed to effectively maintain pollution prevention measures both on side and at access points.   The Contractor will be required to haul excavated material on City of Houston public streets in a manner that prevents or minimizes damage to the streets. Damages to the streets will be the responsibility of the Contractor.   4.3 Utilities.   The excavation of the channel will be near or at existing utilities that cross the bayou and will require care and coordination with utility owners to ensure uninterrupted service.  The excavation in these areas may require temporary shoring to protect Contractor personnel. 4.4 Additional Site Work.   Additional site work along the bayou involves the placement of riprap, the establishment and maintenance of turfing, painting of steel sheet piling and the demolition and disposal of debris. 5.0. Contractor and Corps Partnering.   The Corps of Engineers has come to rely more and more on Contractors during construction to provide inspections of on-going work, to identify potential problems in the plans and specifications for the work, and in technical/engineering advice and guidance as construction progresses.  This is essentially the partnering clause of the specifications.  The contractor on complex jobs, such as Sims Bayou, must have a highly diverse and highly experienced work force.  Certain specifications, i.e. pressure relief w ells and piezometers, specifically require highly experienced and knowledgeable experts on the site.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment no. 0001 to Solicitation RA1341-04-RP-4025 is to provide the following for informational purposes only.  The hour and date previously specified for receipt of offers is NOT extended.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this Amendment prior to the hour and date specified in the solicitation/synopsis or as amended by (a) acknowledging receipt of this amendment on each copy of its offer submitted or by separate letter, fax, or email which includes a reference to the solicitation and amendment number.  FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS PIRIOR TO THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.  

Q:  In the selection criteria, part 1c lists the age of components as a factor in any purchasing decision. Shall I take that to mean that a refurbished tool would be an acceptable response to this solicitation? 

A:  Used and refurbished parts or system are acceptable.  Used components will, however, be down rated in the scoring to account for reduced life expectancy.

Q:  Furthermore, part 2 details criteria regarding past performance. In the case of offering refurbished equipment, we would obviously not be the original equipment manufacturer of the machine in question, and as such any customer testimonial would be of little relevance to this specific offering. Would your technical user's recognition of the established name brand of a particular OEM's standard ion etch /deposition product be sufficient in place of such past performance testimonials? 

A:  The Government would accept the name brand as indication of successful past units sold provided we can easily verify this.  We will still require references to customers who have purchased or used similar systems so that we can get independent information ease of system use and reliability.

Q:  Would the fact that the system is demonstrable immediately negate the need to document past delivery time performance of a machine that is not our own product? 

A:  Yes, if the system is fully operational at present we would not need any documentation indicating past delivery time performance.

Q:  Specification 1.1 mandates a chamber of less than .6m in diameter. Provided other physical constraints and ultimate pressure specified is obtained, would a minor deviation from this specification be acceptable? The chamber in question would be one of .65m ID. Specification 1.3 mandates an 8" conflat pumping port with no provision for a gate valve. So long as the ultimate pressure requirement is obtained, is the style and diameter of the flange a critical factor? Also, in the offering we may make, a gatevalve is already included on the system, and it's removal would not constitute any cost savings to the government. Should this be left on the system and taken as a value added component, or is there a firm requirement for no gate valve to be present? 

A:  A chamber ID of 0.65 m is acceptable.  The chamber dimensions are only rough guidelines.  However, the required footprint limits must be met to allow installation in the existing space in the clean room.  We could consider the requirements met if the system can meet the base pressure requirements with a different type of pumping port, which is of similar or larger diameter than an 8" conflate.  The requirement that the system not come with a gate valve was to minimize system cost and complexity.  If it is less expensive to leave an existing gate valve on the system then this would meet the requirements.

Q:  Specification 3.2 requires the use of 100mm targets. Would 125mm targets be unacceptable? Additionally: I see no requirement for deposition or etch rate monitoring. Shall we assume that such processes will not be monitored in real time, and rather determined after the fact and controlled by ion exposure times and beam current? 

A:  100 mm targets were specified to minimize system cost.  If the proposed system is less expensive with 125 mm targets then this is acceptable.

Q:  The solicitation is worded with a requirement for a load lock to be quoted as an option. Would any proposal that does not include an option for a load lock be automatically disqualified, or would its merits be considered if the product represents itself as an attractive option?

A:  The system must be capable of adding on a load lock.  The specification of the system must clearly confirm this.  An offer will not be automatically disqualified if no load lock option is included with the offer; however, the scoring will be down rated accordingly.
