<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI)/Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this RFI/Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with RFI/Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting market research to determine the capabilities and interest of vendors to fulfill FAA's need to upgrade critical components associated with the Alaskan Satellite Telecommunication Infrastructure (ASTI) - formerly Alaskan NAS Interfacility Communications System (ANICS).  The specifics of the procurement method have not yet been determined.  Because of the potential for a limited vendor base and geographical challenges associated with providing equipment and support services in Alaska, the FAA is considering alternative procurement strategies for the modernization of ASTI to include the following:
	A contract award to an integration firm who will be the primary interface to the Government and manage the overall effort of any subcontractors.	Multiple contract awards for the upgrade of ASTI. 	Multiple contract awards for equipment where the FAA may use existing resources to upgrade ASTI.  
The market survey responses will provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing its procurement method.  
The FAA may decide to conduct full and open competitions, limited competitions, sole source, or set aside all or part of the procurements for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. This market survey, however, does not commit the FAA to any future acquisition activity.
The estimated value of the potential contracts is $31,000,000.  The FAA anticipates contract awards not later than 3rd quarter of fiscal year 2009.  Interested firms are advised that the value of the potential contracts represent estimates only.
Interested firms must be able to provide equipment and support services necessary to upgrade critical components associated with ASTI.  The equipment and support services provided under these proposed acquisitions may include, but not be limited to, the acquisition of equipment, program and implementation planning, scheduling, site surveys, documentation development, integration and test, equipment deployment and equipment installation and checkout, training, and limited operations and maintenance.
To assist the FAA in its acquisition planning, interested firms are requested to provide the following information:
1.	Capability Statementa.	List your capabilities and resources to provide all or some of the work described in the attached work requirements (Attachment A).b.	Indicate whether you currently provide any related equipment or service to customersc.	List your experience with satellite communications.d.	Describe your experience providing real-time network monitoring systems, including associated information system security tools.e.	Describe any experience you have providing equipment, logistic support, construction, or support services in Alaska, including remote areas.f.	Based on the information contained in Attachment A, describe your programmatic approach to providing equipment and support services (in-house, integrator, subcontractor, etc.)
2.	Business Declaration form.
To ensure full consideration by the FAA, responses to this RFI/Market Survey should be submitted No Later Than 4:00 P.M. local time on June 20, 2008, to the following address:
Federal Aviation AdministrationAttn:  Dana D. Brooks800 Independence Avenue, S.W., Room 510Washington, DC  20591
Responses should be 10 pages or less not including the Business Declaration form.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email address:  dana.d.brooks@faa.gov.   Please submit as a MS Word or Adobe file.  If you can not respond electronically, please send at least two (2) hard copies by the indicated deadline.  All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.

<DESC>On April 17, 2008, the FAA published an announcement at this web site seeking market data on products that could meet FAA ATO requirement for smart card readers.  The FAA received responses from several sources claiming that several different commercial products meet the FAA's stated requirements.  The FAA plans to pursue a testing phase to ascertain which of the products actually meet the FAA's requirements.  The FAA will be including in this testing phase ONLY those products for which responses had been received in response to the previous announcement.  The purpose of the testing is to develop a Qualified Products List for this requirement.  Once that has been accomplished, the FAA will publish an additional announcement at this web site requesting offers for Smart Card Readers (on a fixed priced basis).  Offerors will be allowed to propose any of the items identified on the Qualified Products List which will be published along with the Request for Offers (RFO).
The FAA currently plans to have the testing completed and the RFO issued sometime during the month of June 2008.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Office (CGS) in Portland, Oregon has a requirement at the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex (San Diego County) near Jamul, California for hazard fuel reduction treatments.
San Diego National Wildlife Refuge is located in San Diego County near the community of Jamul. Refuge lands are managed by the Department of Interior U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS). Most refuge lands are within the wildland-urban interface. Hazard fuel reduction treatments in these areas target non-native invasive species, many of which increase fire hazard, increase the risk of wildland fires spreading to adjacent developed areas, and significantly decrease wildlife habitat quality. Because most of the target species are able to resprout after cutting, the fuel reduction treatments must be accompanied by herbicide application to inhibit regrowth. Follow-up treatments are typically required for several years after the initial treatment.The total area of the five treatment units is 138 acres; however, the actual area to be treated within those units is approximately 5-10 acres. Patches of giant reed are typically small (less than 0.02 acres) and scattered throughout the project area, and palm trees number approximately 30.
The project area consists of four treatment units in the Steele Canyon drainage along Campo Road, and one treatment unit along Jamacha Boulevard just south of its intersection with Highway 94 (Maps 1-3). The majority of the project area consists of Southern Coast Live Oak Riparian Forest dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), California sycamore {Platanus racemosa), western cottonwood (Populus fremontii ssp. fremontii), and willows (Salix spp.). Upland areas surrounding the riparian woodland are classified as Diegan coastal sage scrub and southern mixed chaparral. The primary species to be targeted is giant reed (Arundo donax). Time and funding permitting, other species such as tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), Peruvian peppertree {Schinus molle), Mexican fan palm {Washingtonia robusta), tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca), and castor bean (Ricinus communis) will be targeted. These species, especially giant reed, tamarisk, and Mexican fan palm, are known to significantly increase fire hazard in the wildland-urban interface.
The selection process shall be "Best Value" (Price, Past Performance, and Technical Experience) in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-02 Evaluation - Commercial Items.  Current FAR Subparts, Provisions, and Clauses may be referenced at: http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html.  
RFQ 801818Q26 may be viewed via the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System - Electronic Commerce at http://www.fedbizopps.gov or http://www.nbc.gov.  
The RFQ response date will be 15 days from the posting date.  For assistance in downloading information from the National Business Center, contact the helpdesk at (703) 390-6707.  Interested vendors must be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) http://www.ccr.gov/.  
NOTE:  This acquisition is set-aside for small business concerns; however, the government is accepting quotes from large businesses.  In the event of insufficient small business concern participation, award will be made to participating large business.  The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 115310.  The Product Service Code (PSC) is F003 and small business size standard is $6.5 million.

The Mormon Lake Basin #2 Project Area is approximately 25 miles south of Flagstaff, Arizona, west of the village of Mormon Lake, in Township 18 North, Range 8 East, sections 24, 25, 26 and 36 and Township 18 North, Range 9 East, sections 18, 19 and 30, G&SRBM, Coconino County, Arizona.    The period of performance on this contract is from the date of Notice to Proceed through December 31, 2011.  The solicitation will issue on about June 4, 2008 with Proposals due close of business on or about July 3, 2008.  Award will be made on Best Value basis evaluation criteria which will include utilization of local workforces as well as other factors.  All evaluation criteria will be stated in the solicitation.  This procurement is set-aside 100% for small business.  NAICS code 115310, Size Standard $6.5 million in annual proceeds for the average three preceding years.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services.
PURPOSE: This study will provide needed baseline data about subsistence harvest and sharing activities in select communities proximate to the proposed North Aleutian Basin (NAB) Program Area, as identified in the 5-Year Proposed Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program (2007-2012) of the USDOI Minerals Management Service (MMS).  In anticipation of lease sale planning for 2010, the agency has acute need for information in the vicinity of the lease sale where resident households engage in substantial marine-based subsistence efforts.  This study is intended to initiate data collection in Akutan, False Pass, Nelson Lagoon, and Port Heiden, the subsistence-oriented communities most proximate to the proposed sale area where exploration activities may soon occur.
OBJECTIVE/GOAL:  The goal of the study is to increase the accuracy of assessment of community vulnerability and resiliency to environmental changes that may be associated with offshore oil and gas development activities, and also to improve any subsequent analysis of potential mitigation options and stipulations that may be necessary because of identified vulnerabilities.  The study will focus on localized subsistence activities and potential direct effects that could include changes in the productivity of fishing and hunting locations or in their spatial distribution and accessibility.  The study will seek to provide an empirical basis from which to quantify local subsistence food harvest and sharing behaviors and to assess the plausibility of hypothetical linkages between regional oil development activities and changes in subsistence practices over time.  This will be especially challenging, given recent fluctuations in the Bering Sea ecosystem, including unpredictable weather, changes in the characteristics of sea ice, and changes in the ranges of fish and wildlife.
SCOPE OF WORK: The study will specifically pursue the following sets of information in select communities:
 A detailed ethnographic description of the types and amounts of food resources currently harvested and distributed in the community, with residential accounts of the range of variability inherent to those processes; A contemporary social map of subsistence food distribution channels that identifies significant household networks and specifies the typical size, frequency, and type of food portions that are shared through the community from harvest to consumption; A thorough analysis of collected data that identifies key nodes and thresholds in the distribution network that could be vulnerable to disruption from industrial development.
The study will thus provide useful ethnographic information about social systemic processes of change and stability for consideration by stakeholders and government officials in future offshore lease sale decisions and in regulatory reviews of exploration and production plans.  It is anticipated that residents of selected sampling communities will support such a research effort and will be actively engaged with ethnographic fieldworkers in the collection of relevant data.
HOW TO RESPOND: For a full copy of the Request for Proposal(RFP), please contact Olivia F. Adrian via email at olivia.adrian@mms.gov  Please include in your request the Solicitation Number M08PS00075 and title Subsistence Study for North Aleutian Basin (NAB), your organizations name, point of contact, Dunn & Bradstreet number, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address.  Requests must be made no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time/Date: June 6, 2008.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Tufts University, 711 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111 services regarding the evaluation of iron levels and the risk of upper gastrointestinal cancers in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of performance:  June 3, 2008 - August 3, 2008.</p>
<p>The Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Group (http://dceg.cancer.gov/neb/research/ugcrg), based in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, conducts intramural research which predominantly focuses on nutritional exposures that may mediate risk of specific UGI malignancies, such as gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  The ultimate goal is to identify exposures that can be modified in order to reduce human cancer risk.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of this study is to study the association of serum ferritin and serum transferrin saturation with the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, adjusting for the likely confounding variable of inflammation (CRP).</p>
<p>The contractor shall do the following:</p>
<p>1.   Measure serum ferritin using an immunoradiometric assay (Count-A-Count Ferritin IRMA: Diagnostic Products Los Angeles, CA) for each and every individual sample.</p>
<p>2.  Measure serum iron and unsaturated iron binding capacity using a standard ferrozine-based iron colormetric assay (Olympus AU 400e auto analyzer) for each and every individual sample.<br /> <br />3.  Measure CRP levels using a latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay kit (KASSAY CRP Ultra (Equal Diagnostics, Exton, PA)) for each and every individual sample.</p>
<p>The contractor shall do the above-mentioned analyses on all 82 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 257 gastric cancer, 339 matched control and 76 quality control samples.</p>
<p>An earlier analysis of serum ferritin, serum iron, unsaturated iron-binding capacity and CRP in a case-control study of colon cancer (Cross et al. 2006), also nested in the ATBC Cancer Prevention Study, used Dr. Wood's laboratory at Tufts University for its analytical measurements.  The NCI will compare our results with the results of this previous study, to compare the effects of iron status on cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.  It is essential that the analyses be performed in the same laboratory. The laboratory of Tufts University is one of the few laboratories that can undertake such analyses with a high level of confidence, which has led to their international reputation for high quality mineral assessment.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on June 3, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80077-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be for one year from date of award.</p>
<p>Pathology tissue from cancer patients provides increasing opportunities for the study of biological questions relevant to tumor etiology and for detecting early markers of disease.  Pathology specimens provide a resource for examining DNA, proteins and RNA in tissue and can be used to compare tumors that are associated with different risk factors, thus strengthening associations that might be made between exposures and disease.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to conduct pathologic review and confirmation of the presence of kidney tumor tissue collected in frozen biopsy samples in the Central and Eastern European RCC study.  The objective is to confirm the presence of clear cell tumor tissue obtained in frozen tissue biopsies from each of the cases, and also oversee the extraction of DNA and RNA from these tissues.</p>
<p>The tumor panel described in this project is an expansion of 200 tumor samples previously extracted and analyzed at the University of California San Francisco Cancer Center. These samples are a continuation of an ongoing collaborative tumor marker study between the National Cancer Institute and UCSF.  It is important for scientific comparability of analytic results to work with UCSF for this study.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), intends to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type of contract for this acquisition of various parts for the  Fisher & Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 including but not limited to: Post Scales (for weighing assembly), NSN:  6660-00-228-0258, ASN: D111-3SP119,  F&P part number (P/N) 403C00A12 or equivalent; Punch and Die Assembly, NSN:  6625-00-350-3541, ASN:  D111-8A162,  F&P P/N 625A401U01 or equivalent; Lower Case Assembly, NSN:  6660-01-117-7567, ASN:  D111-1A100-2,  F&P P/N 18312 or equivalent; Funnel, NSN:  6660-00-071-0435, ASN:  D111-1SP105, F&P P/N 351C101U01 or equivalent, these parts are used to support the NWS ASOS program.  These parts must be in accordance with (IAW) Fischer & Porter Company, Parts List for Precipitation Gage-Recorder, for series 35B1558 and 35B1559 (attached).
The Fischer and Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 was originally manufactured in the early 1980?s for the National Weather Service (NWS).  The F&P consists of two main parts, a rain-collecting pan that will hold a total of about 19.5 inches of rain and an automatic, yet intricate and delicate, weighing and recording mechanism.  Every 15 minutes, a timer activates the recording mechanism and holes are punched into a paper tape (or strip chart) indicating the cumulative amount of collected rainfall to the nearest tenth of an inch using a weight to depth conversion factor.  The paper tape is divided into frames; each individual frame is divided into 24 hour segments.  At the beginning of each month, an observer is tasked with removing the tape and sending it to the local NWS office.  There, it is examined and forwarded to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and publication as official Hourly Precipitation Data.  The F&P (ASN:  D111) is a legacy system in dire need of an upgrade.  This upgrade comes in the form of the Fischer & Porter Upgrade (FPU), in which the existing punch mechanism will be replaced with a digital data recording system.  Until all F&P weighing rain gages can be upgraded at the higher cost FPU, NWS must support the legacy components to sustain the established cooperative network.  Because the F&P weighing rain gage was originally procured from Belfort Instrument Company by part number, they are the only source known to have the drawings and specifications needed to manufacture a part that complies with the F&P Part Numbers as stated herein. 
 
The Government at its discretion may make multiple awards for indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contracts for this equipment, each will cover a five (5) year period.  The Government at its discretion may require first article testing.  The acquisition(s) will be conducted in accordance with the processes set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12.6 ? Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  A solicitation will be issued on or before March 17, 2008 and will be uploaded to the FedBizOpps, the solicitation can also be requested via fax to 816-274-6923, Attn: Carey Marlow or via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov.  The proposal due date and time will be published in the solicitation.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  It will be the responsibility of interested parties to download the solicitation and related documents, and to revisit the site frequently to obtain any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  This solicitation and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-23).  The prices proposed shall be inclusive of all costs.  Firms other than Belfort Instrument Company, interested in this requirement must respond to this notice by submitting demonstrated evidence of its capability and experience in manufacturing the exact part specified and its use in the F&P weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559.

Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.
The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.
ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

Justification for Procurement Request
Action:	Cost Estimating Spreadsheet Tool Enhancement for Low-Impact Development Best Management Practices
The Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division, Non-Point Source Branch is tasked with evaluating the life-cycle costs of Low-Impact Development (LID) Best Management Practices (BMP) as part of encouraging communities to incorporate LID.  An important component of the evaluation is the development and promotion of a cost tool that will serve multiple uses:  1) Provide a detailed framework to facilitate cost estimation for capital cost, operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, and life-cycle net present value; 2) Serve as a format for cost reporting for both past projects (as literature reviews are completed) and current and future projects; 3) Provide users with planning-level cost estimates.
The use of this cost tool will enable consistent reporting of cost data on LID BMPs, so that users will be able determine the cost of each component of the project, both in materials and in planning and design.  The existence of a standard format will greatly improve the ease of preparing cost estimates, since the necessary line items are broken out for consideration. Creating an understanding of the life-cycle cost benefits of LID will lead to more use of LID and green infrastructure in development and redevelopment. 
OWOW plans to enhance a cost tool spreadsheet Water Environment Research Federation (WERF) for BMPs that WERF has already developed and has copyrighted that incorporates all of these features for some conventional  BMPs, and limited LID BMPs.  The spreadsheet tool was developed by WERF as part of the 2005 report ?Performance and Whole Life Costs of Best Management Practices and Urban Drainage Systems?.  Use of this copyrighted WERF cost tool as a basis for an enhanced LID BMP cost tool will serve several objectives:  1) Minimize the cost of developing a new tool by building on one that already incorporates the desired features; 2) Improve the outreach and use of the tool via the existing network of WERF members and member communities; and 3) Engage the existing WERF project team of prominent researchers in LID cost estimation, including university professors and professional practitioners familiar with this life-cycle cost tool for Low-Impact Development.
WERF has agreed that if they are selected for this project they will make the resulting enhanced tool, with the previously developed components, freely available to EPA and to the public.  

A procurement is requested for the following items:
1.  Add to the copyrighted spreadsheet tool the following LID BMPs with line item cost categories for capital and O&M, parametric cost estimation, and life-cycle cost analysis:
I. Green Roofs, extensive-type only, considering elements affecting cost including:i.	Building height and crane accessibilityii.	Different media types iii.	Construction items, such a membrane typesiv.	Retrofit or new constructionv.	Flat or sloped roofvi.	Different safety systemsvii.	Objective (aesthetic, stormwater control, extend roof life, etc.)viii.	Integrated elements (trees, turf, pavers, deck, etc.)
II. Bioretention, considering elements affecting cost including:       i. Type (residential raingarden, curb-inset planter boxes, traffic islands, larger commercial area or neighborhood basins).       ii. With or without underdrains
III. Cisterns (large commercial cisterns)
2.   Add a construction year field to the project templates
3.   Update the User?s Guide
4.   Evaluate the feasibility and cost of the following: I. Adding a U.S. Cost Region Pick-list Selection (a standard city index system such as RS Means? 30-city or ENR?s 20-city) to identify projects in a cost region II. Updating parametric estimates, with literature citations 

Objective:  To produce an effective tool for estimating, reporting, and collecting life-cycle cost information associated with the planning, design, and construction of stormwater conventional and LID BMPs.
Contract Plan:  Funds are to be allocated from the FY2008 OWOW budget.
					    JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

2.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:
The U. S. EPA, Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds is seeking a sole source contract with the Water Environment Research Federation (WERF).  The WERF is in a unique position to help EPA accomplish the strategic goal of enabling consistent practices for evaluation of the life-cycle costs for green infrastructure.
The Water Environment Research Federation (WERF) recently developed a copyrighted spreadsheet cost tool that incorporates the cost assessment features desired for the EPA cost tool.  The tools serves multiple uses:  1) Provides a detailed framework to facilitate cost estimation for capital cost, operation and maintenance cost, and life-cycle net present value; 2) Serves as a format for cost reporting for both past projects (as literature reviews are completed) and current and future projects; 3) Provides users with planning-level cost estimates. 
The WERF tool currently addresses some conventional Best Management Practices (BMPs), and limited Low-Impact Development (LID) practices.  The spreadsheet tool was developed by WERF as part of the 2005 report ?Performance and Whole Life Costs of Best Management Practices and Urban Drainage Systems?.  
Use of this existing WERF cost tool as a basis for an enhanced LID BMP cost tool will serve several objectives:  1) Minimize the cost of developing a new tool by building on one that already incorporates the desired features; 2) Improve the outreach and use of the tool via the existing network of WERF members and member communities; and 3) Engage the existing WERF project team of prominent researchers in LID cost estimation, including university professors and professional practitioners familiar with this life-cycle cost tool for Low-Impact Development.
In addition, this existing cost tool is owned by WERF, and therefore creating enhancements to the tool or replicating the tool may infringe on WERF ownership.  WERF has agreed that if they are awarded this work they will make the resulting tool, with the previously developed components, freely available to EPA and to the public.  

3.  Removal of barriers to competition for similar future acquisitions:
As part of this contract, the tool now owned by WERF will be freely available for modification by EPA or other users.  EPA will be able to make modifications on a competitive basis as needed if development outside of WERF resources is beneficial. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation, to martinez.thomas@epa.gov, phone number (202)564-1418, which establishes that their specifications meet EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by EPA. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.






















NAICS code 541990:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Water Environment Research Foundation, Alexandria, VA.. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.
Justification for Procurement Request
Action:	Cost Estimating Spreadsheet Tool Enhancement for Low-Impact Development Best Management Practices
The Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division, Non-Point Source Branch is tasked with evaluating the life-cycle costs of Low-Impact Development (LID) Best Management Practices (BMP) as part of encouraging communities to incorporate LID.  An important component of the evaluation is the development and promotion of a cost tool that will serve multiple uses:  1) Provide a detailed framework to facilitate cost estimation for capital cost, operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, and life-cycle net present value; 2) Serve as a format for cost reporting for both past projects (as literature reviews are completed) and current and future projects; 3) Provide users with planning-level cost estimates.
The use of this cost tool will enable consistent reporting of cost data on LID BMPs, so that users will be able determine the cost of each component of the project, both in materials and in planning and design.  The existence of a standard format will greatly improve the ease of preparing cost estimates, since the necessary line items are broken out for consideration. Creating an understanding of the life-cycle cost benefits of LID will lead to more use of LID and green infrastructure in development and redevelopment. 
OWOW plans to enhance a cost tool spreadsheet Water Environment Research Federation (WERF) for BMPs that WERF has already developed and has copyrighted that incorporates all of these features for some conventional  BMPs, and limited LID BMPs.  The spreadsheet tool was developed by WERF as part of the 2005 report ?Performance and Whole Life Costs of Best Management Practices and Urban Drainage Systems?.  Use of this copyrighted WERF cost tool as a basis for an enhanced LID BMP cost tool will serve several objectives:  1) Minimize the cost of developing a new tool by building on one that already incorporates the desired features; 2) Improve the outreach and use of the tool via the existing network of WERF members and member communities; and 3) Engage the existing WERF project team of prominent researchers in LID cost estimation, including university professors and professional practitioners familiar with this life-cycle cost tool for Low-Impact Development.
WERF has agreed that if they are selected for this project they will make the resulting enhanced tool, with the previously developed components, freely available to EPA and to the public.  
A procurement is requested for the following items:
1.  Add to the copyrighted spreadsheet tool the following LID BMPs with line item cost categories for capital and O&M, parametric cost estimation, and life-cycle cost analysis:

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. Continuous outbreaks of human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses from infected birds have occurred since late 2003 in Asia, Europe and/or Africa. Ongoing influenza surveillance reveals that H5N1 viruses are endemic in bird populations and suggests that continued human exposure is likely. As a result, the threat of a pandemic caused by highly pathogenic influenza viruses continues.	
The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. DHHS has undertaken a portfolio matrix approach to modernize and diversify influenza vaccines and to expand domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing surge capacity. Specific measures were implemented that support advanced development of cell-based influenza vaccines and antigen-optimization approaches for pandemic influenza vaccines, stockpiling of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and building of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing infrastructure.  
	  
	DHHS now seeks to leverage recombinant-based technologies to decrease the timeline of vaccine production in response to a newly emerged pandemic influenza strain. The timeline for the availability of egg- and cell-based inactivated pandemic influenza vaccines in the U.S. is estimated at 20-23 weeks post-pandemic onset, which may be towards the end of a first pandemic wave. Recombinant-based influenza vaccines, which may not be dependent on pandemic influenza virus reference strain availability and the production and calibration of potency assay reagents needed for inactivated influenza vaccines, may be available 8 to 12 weeks post-pandemic onset. The effect of vaccination combined with influenza antiviral drugs and community mitigation measures may delay the peak incidence of pandemic influenza disease and reduce mortality and morbidity during a severe pandemic.        
           
The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, contemplates single or multiple contract awards to develop recombinant influenza vaccines based on hemagglutinin genes or proteins (plasmid DNA, virus-vectors, peptides, subunit proteins and virus-like particles) and leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds include clinical investigation lot manufacturing, scale-up process development, clinical evaluation, validation of manufacturing process systems and manufacturing facility concept design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or have partnerships with companies owning vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Other requirements for offerors include the following: (1) a completed final report of Phase I clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity and cross-reactivity or cross-neutralization of antigenically drifted influenza strains using a recombinant influenza  vaccine (2) written evidence of firm commitment to establish and maintain the necessary facilities in the U.S. to manufacture bulk and final container recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine with a manufacturing surge capacity of 50 million doses within six months, (3) a manufacturing production cycle that  permits recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine lot release within 12 weeks of a pandemic declaration. (4) a comprehensive development plan and timeline for U.S licensure of a recombinant pandemic-like influenza vaccine.
               
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be  three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-BARDA-07-06 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about September 14, 2007. Proposals will be due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP-DHHS-BARDA-07-06, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of March 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The acquisition will be executed in four phases.  First, a full and open competitive acquisition will be conducted, culminating in award of  up to two Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for performance of parallel IECU Phase I development efforts, with availability for ordering further development and production.  During Phase I, the two selected contractors will separately perform twelve month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Delivery Orders for the Phase I of System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  Phase I will include design and fabrication of two prototypes of the 9,000-Btu/hr, 115 volt, single phase, 50/60, and two prototypes of the 18,000-Btu/hr, 208 volt, 3 phase, 50/60 Hertz, as well as limited testing to evaluate the contractors' performance.  Following completion of Phase I, the Government intends to conduct a down-select between the two Phase I contractors; and select one to perform a twenty-four month Phase II CPFF Delivery Order requiring completion of SDD efforts on all four IECU variants.  During Phase II, the contractor will be required to design, fabricate, and test eight prototypes per variant to total thirty-two prototypes.  Additionally, all four variants will be subjected to Product Qualification Test (PQT), Logistics Demonstration, and User Evaluation.  Technical Data Packages (TDPs) and Electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs), along with other logistics documents, will be developed and validated for all four variants. Phase III will be a Delivery Order for an eight month Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Delivery Order for  Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), requiring delivery of 60 of each IECU variant.  Phase IV is Full Rate Production and will allow for issuance of FFP Delivery Orders for a maximum of approximately 9,460 IECU units. Phase III and IV also include the purchase of initial spare and repair parts, updates to logistics documentation, and user training.  The small business size standard for NAICS 333415 is 750 employees.

AFHSC is the central epidemiological resource for the U.S. Armed Forces providing regularly scheduled and customer-requested analyses and reports to policy makers, medical planners, and researchers.  It identifies and evaluates obstacles to medical readiness by linking various databases that communicate information relevant to service members experience that has the potential to affect their health.  (http://afhsc.army.mil/index.asp)  DoD-GEIS:  The mission of the DoD Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DoD-GEIS) is to conduct surveillance and response for emerging infectious diseases in DoD beneficiaries as well as foreign military and in foreign civilian populations through project-driven proposals which are implemented by its partner institutions and laboratories in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas.  DoD-GEIS focuses on diseases that threaten U.S. forces and their families, including newly appearing infectious agents or well-known agents that are increasing in incidence or geographic range.  (http://www.geis/fhp.osd.mil)  The GEIS strategic plan is based on the following four goals:  1) surveillance and detection; 2) response and readiness; 3) integration and innovation; and 4) cooperation and capacity building (including training).  The contractor shall provide on-site support specific to the requirements of the AFHSC/DoD-GEIS for the implementation support of the specified DoD Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Tasks outlined in the DoD Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan.

The contractor shall complete the majority of the tasks in the performance-based statement of work at 2900 Linden Lane, Silver Spring, MD  20910.  The contractor may be required to accomplish some tasks at other locations.  The Contracting Officers Representative (COR) will provide specific direction on a task-by-task basis.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt intends to award on a sole-source basis, a simplified acquisition, to The Egmont Group for an agency membership.  

This membership allows law enforcement agencies around the world an important avenue for information exchange.  The Egmont Group is the coordinating body for the International Group of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs).  This was formed in 1995 in order to promote and enhance international cooperation in anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.  This membership allows FIUs to receive, analyze, and disclose information by financial institutions to competent authorities of suspicious or unusual financial transactions.  In addition, many FIUs can also be of assistance in providing other government administrative data and public record information to their counterparts, which can also be very helpful to investigators. 

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than Tuesday, May 27, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. EST. A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we will make a sole-source award to The Egmont Group.

<a href="mailto:olivia.adrian@mms.gov">Adrian, Olivia F.</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm. 
BACKGROUND: Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations. New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Funding is not currently available for the project.  Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2009 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of approximately $ 1,500,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2009 with projects being identified through this announcement. NOTICE: MMS may share the white papers with other organizations for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared. Contractors should plan to gather data from an external source for these projects, where applicable, as only limited data may be available from the MMS.  MMS may publish deliverables from research contracts so contractors should be prepared to submit nonproprietary reports or reports with a short confidentiality period.
OBJECTIVE: The topics for the FY 2009 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following: The topics for the FY 2009 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following:  1. Compare materials for use in construction of a synthetic mooring system (polyester, High modulus polyethylene-HMPE, Kevlar, etc).   Many new materials are being proposed for construction of synthetic mooring. Investigate the current construction materials as well as alternative materials and provide a comparison of each, including a quick reference guide for reference when considering new alternatives. The desired outcome should include a matrix of properties, attributes, strengths, weaknesses, etc., of  each material as well as a short discussion of the most appropriate uses for each and any specific situation or use which should be avoided. The matrix of different synthetic materials and their properties also needs to include any updated information since the Engineer's Design Guide was published as well as a summary of that data.2. In-line Inspection of low-pressure low-volume (LPLV) in-service gas pipelines to detect wall loss.The Pacific OCS Region requires in-line inspection of all in-service oil and gas pipelines. As oil and gas fields mature, lower flow rates and pressure make smart pigging for gas pipelines more challenging. One method used to overcome LPLV in-line inspection challenges is to propel pigs with water. The introduction of water into a gas pipeline leads to dewatering and corrosion issues. In the presence of H2S, the introduction of water can produce acidic conditions. The desire of this research is to help develop or to identify in-line inspections that can be conducted periodically without a tether or the addition of a fluid. The results of this study could be applicable to all of MMS regions as well as Dept of Transportation (DOT) lines. This study may be suitable for a JIP.3.  Analyze the risks of drilling a subsea well with Dual Gradient mud in well bore and riser in comparison to drilling the same well conventionally.  A non-linear pressure gradient allows drilling much deeper without setting casing strings and can represent a significant savings in the drilling cost for a well. These savings may come at increased risk. Risk assessment for this topic should include procedural risks, well control risks and cementing risks and the final report should ideally address methods to reduce high risk aspects of the use of dual gradient mud. 4. Using epoxy in well abandonments.MMS is considering use of epoxy-based materials for abandonment for wells damaged by recent hurricanes. These wells do not have vertical access and may be buckled below the mud line therefore preventing wire line operations via tubing to set plugs near the packer or punch the tubing to circulate cement into the casing. MMS would like a review of materials and procedures for epoxy-based well abandonments.  This epoxy material is reported to have 2.6 times the compressive strength and 4 times the bond strength of cement. It is reported that this material can be weighted up to 19 ppg and if placed in a casing annuli at the mud line, will settle through completion fluids to the top of the packer. At a minimum, please address the following: How does this compare to cement abandonments? Can this material effectively drop 7000 feet through a casing annuli and accumulate on top of the packer? How long would it take this material to travel to the bottom of casing annuli and cure? How will this material stand up over time? How does weighting this material with BaSO4 affect the compressive and bond strength? 5. Flexible flowlinesFlexible flowlines are constructed from alternating layers of elastomeric material and steel banding wrapped around the elastomeric material. The wrapped steel banding provides the strength needed for high pressure fluid containment. New technology is being proposed where steel banding will be replaced with carbon fiber. The carbon fiber has the advantage of being stronger than steel with a significant weight savings. MMS would like a comparison made between steel wrapped flexible flowlines and carbon fiber wrapped flexible flowlines. At a minimum, the researcher should determine the disadvantages of using carbon fiber wrapped flexible flowlines over steel wrapped flexible flowlines.6. Options for dampening construction noises for wind farms.There is concern regarding the effects of the noise from pile driving and other construction activities on marine life. What new or existing mitigation measures could be employed to dampen construction noise? 7. Recommend designs standards to ensure structural safety/ reliability/ survivability of offshore wind farms on the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).In oil and gas activities, structures are designed and assessed in accordance with API RP2A-WSD. A similar document is needed for the structures that comprise an offshore wind farm. These design standards would take into account the unique operating environment of the US OCS as well as the unique structural loads associated with potential wind farm structures, both fixed and floating. 8. Study of wind farm/turbine accidents.Numerous accidents have occurred since the inception of wind farms. A review of these accidents could potentially determine some general trends; mitigation measures; recommended 6 industrial safety management programs, etc. The study should also look at who is conducting the construction, inspection and maintenance of the facilities (contractor versus operator), what systems are in place, or are recommended, to ensure these operations are conducted in a manner that is conducive of sound safety measures.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety and pollution practices for offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, proposals may be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should address the above stated issues.
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms Olivia Adrian, not later than June 23, 2008 at 04:00 PM, EDT.

<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking the services of a historic paper conservator to provide professional paper conservation for the Truman Home at Harry S Truman National Historic Site, Independence, Missouri.  The conservator must demonstrate skill in wallpaper removal, cleaning, repair and reinstallation to return the historic appearance to all spaces being treated during these projects.  Conservator must demonstrate membership in good standing with the American Institute for Conservation of Historic & Artistic Works (AIC).
It is anticipated an Architecture and Engineering (A/E)  team will be in the park in May 2008 to review the Truman structure and begin design and construction documents for a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and fire sprinkler systems.  Design and construction documents will identify locations for the ductwork and sprinkler system installation.  Wall and ceiling papers must be removed in designated locations to preserve the historic wallpaper and to allow access to plaster and provide openings for the installation of the systems. 
In order to preserve and install wallpaper, the services of a paper conservator will be required to remove the wall and ceiling papers in advance of this project work.  The locations designated for wallpaper removal require close coordination and cooperation with maintenance and cultural resources staff to ensure the least possible compromise to the historic appearance of the home interior.  The paper and plaster work requires coordination with the A/E team and recommendations provided to the installers of the HVAC and fire sprinkler systems.  It is critical to ensure that if specific paper removal areas of these systems overlap plaster project work that it is known to all parties performing work to prevent unnecessary opening and work to interior surfaces.  The National Park Service preserves the home in appearance consistent with the appearance of Harry and Bess Truman's occupation of 219 North Delaware.
Wallpaper conservation work will be required on both the first and second floors for the Truman home of the HVAC and fire sprinkler systems.  The primary focus for the plaster and wallcovering will be on locations on the first floor where plaster and paper are compromised.
The work must be accomplished on a tight deadline and short notice will be required to complete the project work throughout the contract.  The conservator and conservation studio should be in close proximity to the historic site to respond to construction contractors and to ensure good response time to meet project timetables.  Wallpaper samples are required to be safely transported by the conservator to the studio where the work will be performed. Conservator is responsible for providing specialized boxes to safely transport wallpapers to and from the site.
The complexity of the project requires that the conservator be readily available and familiar with the different types of papers and plasters and adhesives utilized during the historic period in order to understand the unique problems likely to be encountered during the project.  This is a treatment project to preserve and protect historic fabric-and the intrinsic cultural value and historic association for a Presidential home and therefore an irreplaceable heritage asset.
The NAICS code will be 711510.   The Service Contract Act will apply.

<DESC><p>To ensure that NSTec administers its defined benefit plan in accordance with its plan document, NSTec is interested in upgrading its retirement benefit calculation process. To accomplish this goal, NSTec is interested in receiving detailed information on co-sourcing, outsourcing, and other retirement benefit calculation solutions Subcontractor offers to ensure that NSTec provides accurate retirement benefits to eligible plan participants.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2006, NSTec was awarded the Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) prime contract to manage the Nevada Test Site contract. NSTec assumed sponsorship of the Bechtel Nevada (prior contractor) defined benefit plan. When Bechtel Nevada was awarded the Nevada Test Site contract in 1996, it assumed sponsorship of three former contractor pension plans; these plans were merged into a single plan in 1997. There are approximately 1,996 active plan participants, 25 disabled participants, 38 frozen active participants, 2,291 term vested participants, and 2,947 participants currently receiving a benefit. NSTec must perform several retirement calculations for those employees who have service with a prior contractor. The current process is cumbersome and manually intensive. The NSTec Employee Retirement Plan Summary Plan Description, the EG&amp;G Energy Measurements Employees Retirement Plan SPD, the Retirement Plan for Employees of Reynolds Electrical &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. SPD, and the Raytheon Services Nevada Employee Pension Plan SPDs are attached as reference.</p>
<p>Subcontractor shall provide detailed information on alternative retirement benefit calculation solutions that Subcontractor can provide to NSTec to ensure that accurate and timely retirement benefit calculations are performed for eligible employees. Co-sourcing, out-sourcing and other solutions will be considered.</p>
<p>NSTec expects that Subcontractor has appropriate systems, processes and procedures in place to ensure best-in-class deliverables. Subcontractor is also expected to assign Key Personnel to this subcontract that have the appropriate credentials, knowledge, skills, and experience to ensure that all work is of the highest quality, that NSTec achieves the best value for services received, and that all tasks are completed within established deadlines.</p>
<p>Interested parties are to provide a summary within 7 days followed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;detailed information qithin 14 days.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Department of Homeland Security (DSH), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of non-sparking tool kits, to validate their employment and effectiveness when used by emergency responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or hazardous materials (HAZMAT) environments.

The CDP is inviting manufacturers to provide information on non-sparking tool kits. The DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 03OE-04-KTTL.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The assessment will include specific scenarios which require the evaluators to use the equipment to complete tasks while wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. The criteria include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide, in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, web address, and e-mail address.

Request for Information/Sources Sought (RFI/SS) Announcement 
Biometric Land Exit Solution

1.0	Purpose 
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/ Sources Sought (SS) announcement to conduct market research. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this document. Information obtained is for planning purposes only. 
By means of this RFI/SS, the Government seeks to identify potential solutions, service providers, and suppliers interested in participating in the design and development of the Biometric Land Exit Solution for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is also asking for questions and/or feedback on the draft description of business needs; the characteristics of current facilities described in this document; suggestions for concepts of operation, technologies, and devices; and a broad outline of how the Government might provide the Biometric Land Exit Solution for land exit modalities by in-scope travelers at the northern and southern borders of the United States. 
A respondent to this RFI/SS should describe the technology and/or device(s) that can best be used to capture biographic and biometric information in a notional exit process and how the recommended approach will provide solutions for the needs of this RFI/SS (see Section 3.0 Operational Needs). While it is the intent of US-VISIT to fully comply with the statutory mandates to include biometrics as part of the Land Border Exit Solution, respondents are encouraged to describe incremental solutions that may start with captured biographical data and how the Land Border Exit Solution could evolve to accept biometrics in a set time period. If a respondent has specific recommendations on how biographic and biometric data capture should be done with a recommended technology or product, those recommendations should be made explicit in the response to this RFI/SS.
Respondents to this RFI/SS may submit material that addresses all or part of the biographic and biometric data capture needs for any or all of the travel modalities encountered at land ports of entry (POEs). A respondent should provide a clear statement of how each part of its submission addresses a specific need in this RFI/SS. If the described approach requires specific improvements to one or more land POEs, the respondent shall describe what is needed in sufficient detail to allow the Government to evaluate the practicality of the approach.
2.0	General and Background Information
The 9/11 Commission, Congress, and DHS agree that being able to accurately document the entry and exit of non-U.S. citizens is a priority for securing our Nations borders. The results of this market research will be used to inform planning for technologies, devices, processes, and/or procedures that can be used to biometrically verify that a specific in-scope traveler has exited from the United States via a land border. In-scope (see Section 4.1 In-Scope Travelers) is defined as the categories of visitors to the United States who are subject to the processes and procedures established by the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program. US-VISIT entry procedures use biographic information from valid travel documents and biometric data (currently fingerprints and digital photographs) to verify identity. 
US-VISIT provides biometric identification and analysis services to agencies throughout the U.S. immigration, border management, law enforcement, and intelligence communities. US-VISITs services help other agencies (stakeholders), such as Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in DHS; Department of Transportation (DOT); Department of Justice (DOJ); Department of State (DOS); and others to accurately identify people and assess risk. Those international visitors who experience US-VISIT biometric proceduresthe collection of digital fingerprints and photographsdo so when they apply for visas at embassies or consulates abroad and when they enter the United States through air, sea, and land border POEs. In each case, a visitors fingerprints are checked against a database of known and suspected terrorists, criminals, and immigration violators. U.S. consular officers and CBP officers use the results from these checks to make visa issuance and admission decisions. On November 29, 2007, DHS began replacing 2-fingerprint scanners with new 10-fingerprint scanners at U.S. POEs to collect additional fingerprints from international visitors.
US-VISIT deploys identification and verification capabilities at air, sea, and land POEs that improve the integrity of the immigration and border management system while also mitigating the amount of time needed to process in-scope travelers. Functionality developed by US-VISIT has been implemented in phased rollouts called increments. Increments 1, 2, and 3 have provided the capability to obtain quick, secure, and biometrically verified identities in the air, sea, and land border environments. These capabilities are used to ensure that certain categories of aliens who travel to the United States are here legally, that the documents presented are legal documents within valid periods, and that the bearer of a valid travel document is the person to whom the document was issued. 
The biometric exit capability that is the subject of this RFI/SS might use the same information currently gathered by US-VISIT, but respondents to this RFI/SS are invited to suggest other approaches for establishing identity and verifying that identity with biometric data that is highly accurate and difficult to falsify. Because DHS already provides biometric (fingerprint) matching capabilities, and a great deal of DHS infrastructure has been deployed to acquire, transmit, match, and provide the results of fingerprint matching, the respondents to this RFI/SS should make use of these capabilities where they are relevant. However, DHS appreciates that other modalities may emerge in responses to this RFI/SS that also require a centralized matching capability (i.e., biometric matching on modalities other than fingerprints). In these cases, respondents should structure their responses to use existing capabilities, including additional capabilities for the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) managed by US-VISIT, and describe how and why the suggested approach would be an improvement over the fingerprint methods currently used. However, if the response does not require a centralized biometric matching capability, the respondent should describe how biometric verification of identity would occur in a manner that minimizes the opportunity for the fraudulent use of documents, credentials, devices, or other means to establish identity, and should also describe how and why the suggested approach would be an improvement over the fingerprint methods currently used.
The entry process at land POEs accommodates in-scope pedestrians; in-scope travelers in personal automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and similar conveyances; and in-scope travelers in commercial vehicles, including buses, trains, boats, ferries, and other surface transport conveyances. These modes of travel are referred to as land entry and exit modalities. In-scope travelers include people who intend to arrive or actually do arrive at U.S. ports for any purpose that involves applying for entry to the United States. If a non-U.S. citizen traveler is subject to US-VISIT procedures on entry into the United States, that traveler will likely also be subject to US-VISIT procedures to be established for exit from the United States.
For entry into the United States, US-VISIT in-scope travelers must carry and present appropriate travel documents (e.g., a valid passport and visa, if required) and possibly other documents (e.g., Arrival Departure Record, CBP Form I -94, for nonimmigrant visitors with a visa for the United States). Each US-VISIT in scope traveler is required to provide biometricsdigital fingerprints and a photographduring the entry inspection process. Standards for fingerprints and photographs are available at www.biometrics.gov/standards. In contrast to the entry process, other than a pilot testing program (e.g., see 8 C.F.R. 215.8; no such formal biometric procedures have yet been required for in-scope travelers exiting the United States). 
This RFI/SS seeks ideas, approaches, processes, technologies, devices, and/or operational models for implementing an automated, biometrically verified exit capability that interfaces to and interoperates with other Government networks, services, and databases that are also used for US-VISIT entry procedures. Specifically, US-VISIT has provided the means to collect certain biographic and biometric information from in-scope travelers as they enter the United States to verify identity and to provide information used to decide the legal basis for entry into the United States. Biometric verification applies to non U.S. citizenspersons who exit the United States and who are within the applicable categories of in-scope travelers subject to US-VISIT requirements. Generally speaking, US-VISIT currently applies to all visitors (with limited exemptions) holding nonimmigrant visas and to visitors from Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries, regardless of country of origin. The biographic and biometric information collected is used by DHS to verify identity, to implement screening procedures, and to execute the responsibilities it has to operate a comprehensive immigration program.
As part of the systems and capabilities used to establish and to verify the identity of in scope travelers and to record entry and exit information, US-VISIT operates two systems: IDENT is a secure biometric matching system that uses fingerprints, and it may be extended in the future to use other biometric modalities to verify identity and to identify persons when a verification attempt cannot be confirmed. IDENT includes information collected by DHS as well as from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with records of deported felons and other criminals and DHS information on previous criminal histories and previous IDENT enrollments. A separate system, the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS), is used to securely store non U.S. citizen entry and exit data received from the entry and exit manifests of air and sea carriers and from land entries. Other systems also support or are connected to IDENT, including the FBIs Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the Computer Linked Application Information System (CLAIMS), the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), the Consolidated Consular Database (CCD), the Global Enrollment System (GES), the USCG Mona Pass proof of concept mobile biometric capability, and others. 
As a general rule, US-VISIT prefers open systems, standards-based data collection and data messaging formats, and commercially available and readily interoperable technology so that installation, operation, maintenance, and communications are based on accepted, widely deployed, and proven technology solutions. While products and technologies that do not attain all of these goals will be considered, US-VISIT requires that respondents to this RFI/SS clearly describe and detail any nonstandard, not-open, and/or proprietary aspects of their responses to this RFI/SS so that the Government can develop an accurate understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the responses.
The current exit procedure in effect at air, sea, and land ports is specific: all international in-scope travelers who received a Form I-94 upon arrival must return it to an airline or ship representative when departing the United States or deposit it into a designated receptacle if exiting the United States by means of one of the land travel modalities. DHS published a proposed rule establishing air and sea biometric exit requirements and plans to deploy an air and sea port biometric verification of identity solution for exit in 2009. This RFI/SS is to support a similar biometric verification of identity for in-scope travelers as they exit the United States at land POEs.
Legal entry to the United States occurs at specific POEs. Land POEs are defined as those that accommodate pedestrians; vehicles, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and other conveyances; or other facilities or processes that accommodate travel by train, boat, or ferry for entry into the United States. Each POE also accommodates exit from the United States In-scope travelers who enter the United States via one mode may exit via any other mode. The primary goal is to implement the mandated biometrically-verified land exit process with minimal impact on travel time and processing; cost and impact on traffic; surrounding environment and communities; and expense and inconvenience to the traveler. 
US-VISIT is seeking information to help implement the collection of biographic and biometric data from in-scope travelers as they exit from the U.S. by any of the land modalities noted in this RFI/SS. All such collection capabilities must interface to and interoperate with all existing DHS networks, infrastructure, and systems as necessary to maintain the integrity of DHSs border and immigration management system. This RFI/SS requests that responses focus on the sensing/recording/input technology, devices, and/or operational and technical processes to be used at the land exit part of a POE only.
Because of the unique challenges of deploying a biometric exit identity verification solution in the land border environment, especially for multiple occupants of vehicles, land border biometric exit is being addressed separately from air and sea. Note that, for practical reasons, biometric identity verification is established by matching valid travel document(s) with biographic information and a biometric image or scan that agree with existing entries in DHS records. This RFI/SS requests that industry consider and provide suggestions to satisfy the functional needs and desired properties of biometric identity verification for land exit capability or technologies applicable to all land modes of travel. 
3.0 Operational Needs
The following presents a combination of characteristics that outlines the solution space for a land exit system and associated processes, components, and applicable technology. The land exit solution is envisioned to be a combination of processes and technology specifically adapted to the land exit environment, its in-scope travelers, and, as required, system operators. Land exit may encompass multiple technologies, each of which is superior in meeting a particular aspect of the land exit solution. This section presents operational needs as constraints, complexities, qualities, and processes that US-VISIT anticipates the land exit solution will need to address and possess, as well as to attain the following goals: 
	Provide automated capture of an in-scope travelers biographic and biometric information safely and with limited traveler intrusiveness and throughput delays.   
	Biometrically verify the identity manifested by biographic information on legal documents that are presented as part of the exit process.
The following describe the steps in a notional exit process that would be executed by existing DHS capabilities:
	Transmit the biographic and biometric data collected at a port for an exiting in-scope traveler to DHS systems for biometric verification of the identity.
	Perform biometric match operations.
	Record an in-scope travelers departure from the United States in the existing ADIS system.
	Match the exit record to the travelers entry record in the existing ADIS system.
Any or all of the above may be addressed by the response to this RFI/SS as appropriate to provide the solution suggested by the respondents work, or work in a way that improves the value to the Government and/or the traveler.
In all cases, the response should maintain or enhance the following overall US-VISIT goals:
	Enhance the security of our citizens and visitors. 
	Facilitate legitimate travel and trade. 
	Ensure the integrity of our immigration system. 
	Protect the privacy of our visitors. 
3.1 Constraints
Statute, DHS policy, or practical considerations impose the following constraints on, and preferences for, the land exit solution:
	All data collection, usage, and storage related to land exit must comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, international treaties, and DHS guidance on privacy and security.
	Land exit physical infrastructure improvements and construction must comply with applicable environmental statutes and regulations.
	Biometric technologies must follow applicable biometric standards as documented at www.biometrics.gov/standards.
	The Government prefers a land exit solution that applies to all existing land POEs on the northern and southern borders of the United States, but it will consider responses that describe potential solutions that are applicable to a subset of the land POEs.
	Biographic and biometric data shall be collected at the time and place of exit from the United States or at a time and place that is, for practical purposes, virtually at the place of actual exit, such as a roadway or pedestrian facility leading to the actual border crossing point.
	Respondents who propose a solution that would not be at the actual border crossing point (before exiting or after exiting) should describe in detail how this could be done securely.
4.0 Solution Complexities
Complexities are circumstances or facts that make the identification of a solution difficult and that drive the Governments desire for an innovative solution. The following are key complexities.
4.1 In-Scope Travelers
In-scope travelers are:
	Overall only a small percentage of travelers. Out of the approximately 350 million land border entrants to the United States annually, only about 3 percent are currently subject to US-VISIT procedures and data collection. Presumably, about the same number of travelers who enter via land ports will exit via land ports.
	In-scope travelers are mixed with out-of-scope travelers.
	A single vehicle may contain both in-scope and out-of-scope persons, and biometric exit procedures will apply only to the in-scope travelers.
In -scope travelers can cross at a land POE as:
	Pedestrians. 
	Operators of private vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and similar conveyances; or commercial vehicles, such as automobiles, buses, trucks, trains, ferries, boats, ambulances, bicycles, motorcycles, and similar conveyances
	Passengers in either private or commercial conveyances.
In-scope travelers present multiple travel profiles:
	Frequent travelers.
	Infrequent travelers.
	One time/infrequent travelers. 
	Travelers who may enter at one port and leave from another, including air, sea, and land ports.
4.2 Facilities
There are 167 land POE facilities. Each land POE has some kind of exit infrastructure that may be as simple as a road, pedestrian path, or gate; or that may have improvements that provide inspection booths, other structures, road modifications, more elaborate gating structures, or other controls. The physical characteristics of POEs vary widely and may be no more than the roadway that crosses the border, a pedestrian path, or an improved facility that may or may not include specific arrangements to accommodate exit processing. These facilities present a variety of complexities:
	Some POEs are extremely limited in regard to the extent of physical changes that could be introduced due to a variety of considerations, ranging from existing infrastructure that may or may not be owned or leased by the U.S. Government; historic and environmental considerations; weather and geographic constraints in land use; lack of utilities and/or communications; and similar considerations.     
	POE designs vary from large-scale, complex facilities to simple, nearly rustic remote buildings.
	POEs may be 24-hour/7-days-per-week operations while others may have limited operating hours and procedures.
	POE operations and procedures are often driven by the physical layout of the POE. For example, some pedestrian exit areas have controlled turnstiles, while others have open and uncontrolled outdoor areas for pedestrian exit; some vehicle exit lanes are at speed and others lead into toll booth areas currently not used to conduct routine exit operations.
The facilities for exit capabilities are varied. Some POEs have infrastructures that make collecting biometrics at departure manageable, such as extended power communications; installed roads or structures; gate houses, turnstiles, and/or in-lane vehicle inspection booths; utilities; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC); high-speed data communications; space for sensitive equipment; and sheltered areas for inspections. 
Other POEs may not provide these kinds of infrastructure. Furthermore, border crossings may be adjacent to each other or only separated from each other by distances of a few feet. 
This RFI includes in-scope travelers who exit by ferry or rail crossings because they are categorized with land crossings, distinct from those exiting via cruise lines. 
4.3 Desired Qualities and Values
Respondents should identify potential technologies, devices, processes, and/or procedures that can provide all or parts of a biometrically verified data collection system for any or all of the 167 land POEs. The following qualities are desired:
	Safe: The solution imposes no potential health risks to the traveler or inspector (if required in the context of the response), either through the use of the potential solution or an individuals proximity to the devices associated with the potential solution, and does not interfere with the duties of any operator or inspections officer in a manner that poses a threat to the safety of the operator or officer.	
	Secure: The solution prevents unauthorized duplication, alteration, or otherwise fraudulent use of devices or tokens that interfere with the intended use of the solution to biometrically verify the identity of in-scope travelers; the data associated with the solution is captured and transmitted in a manner by which it cannot be intercepted or used in a way other than as intended; and the data and use of the data is structured to protect the privacy of travelers.
	Unobtrusive: The solution minimizes the actions (if any) by the traveler in the biometric collection process.	
	Accurate: A minimum of 97 percent, with a goal of 100 percent, correct biometric identification and verification of legally exiting in-scope travelers, with no collection of data from out-of-scope persons.
	Durable: The solution is built to withstand long periods of use, environmental exposure, both large and small volume use, and resistance to mechanical damage due to dropping, misuse, moisture, etc.
	The solution is easily used by the traveler and operator, if an operator is required.
	The solution is compatible with, or does not interfere with, the existing port environment to the maximum extent possible, including other technologies, such as those used for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), U.S. Canada Border Crossing Initiative (NEXUS), and Free and Secure Trade (FAST); and radiation portal monitors, license plate readers, and other screening devices.
	Comprehensive: The solution applies with minimum adaptation to the population of in-scope travelers exiting the United States.
	The solution has minimal impact on traffic flow.
	The solution has minimal cost to the Government and to in-scope travelers, in terms of initial operating and maintenance costs, and in time or effort spent by in-scope travelers in the exit process.
	The solution has low environmental and social impact (e.g., does not increase or render objectionable traffic patterns, impact historic sites, or compromise privacy) on in-scope travelers and surrounding communities. 
	The solution provides a scalable solution/technology that can be used at both high-volume POEs as well as smaller, less well-developed, and less frequently used ports. However, this is not to be construed to discourage responses that provide a solution that is best for specific ports or situations.
	The solution accommodates full-scope training and testing to ensure that personnel can operate the equipment/technology/process/procedure quickly, competently, and safely, and are able to obtain the intended results.
The Government prefers but does not require a solution that is as open, compatible, and interoperable with industry standard equipment and existing DHS biometric verification capabilities, including interfaces, protocols, and practices. The Government will evaluate responses in this light. It is generally understood that openness, compatibility, and interoperability mean that hardware and software easily attach to and work with commercial off-the-shelf products from other vendors without the need for custom hardware or software adaptation. Software drivers that are otherwise fully compatible with operating systems, computer hardware, and communications equipment in general use in DHS systems are considered interoperable. Respondents are requested to highlight not-open, incompatible, or noninteroperable aspects of their responses.
5.0 Specific Needs
The following information is provided to stimulate responses on how these needs might be satisfied. While many of these needs are stated in a shall format (suggestive of a mandatory requirement), for purposes of this RFI/SS respondents should respond with all appropriate or useful information, even if the information suggests an alternative requirement or standard or suggests reconsideration of the requirement described in this RFI/SS:
1.	Self identification by individuals to determine whether the traveler is in-scope may not be sufficiently reliable. Some assistance, indication, or screening step may be necessary to reliably and accurately apply US-VISIT processing to in-scope travelers.
2.	Processes, procedures, technology, or some combination of these that will enable two objectives:
A.	Rapid identification of in-scope travelers who are in-scope for US-VISIT processing.
B.	Rapid biometric verification of the identity of in-scope travelers, usually accomplished by evaluation of the validity of travel documents and the use of a biometric modality to verify the identity that is asserted by a document. For example, biometric identity verification is performed at entry by using an optical scanner to scan the machine readable zone (MRZ) of a valid travel document and by using fingerscans to determine whether the fingerprints of the person bearing the documents match the fingerprints of the identity on file in IDENT.
3.	The land exit potential solution shall be applicable to and effective with all current and anticipated categories of exiting in-scope travelers within US-VISIT scope.
4.	The land exit potential solution should be compatible across exit modalities. At a minimum, the potential solution should not interfere with devices, technologies, and processes in use for other modalities. 
5.	US-VISIT is committed to facilitating legitimate travel and trade. Accordingly, the time needed to obtain usable biographic and biometric data from a traveler shall be as short as possible while also ensuring that biometric verification of identity is at least 97 percent accurate, with a goal of 100 percent. Technical, process, or procedural add-ons must not cause excessive queuing or congestion at POEs.
6.	The technology described by the respondent for biometric verification of identity should not result in a false positive verification more than 0.1 percent of the time. 
7.	The biometric verification of identity should not result in a false negative verification more than 0.1 percent of the time. 
8.	Methods and mechanisms for reporting the results of identity verification both to individual ports and to DHS shall be defined in the context of the respondents solution.
5.1 Inputs and Outputs
These are the key inputs and outputs that the land exit solution needs to provide:
	Input: Capture biographic and biometric data from in-scope travelers at exit from the United States, regardless of the land mode of travel and with as little interference with or delay of travel as possible.
	Input: Accurate collection of biometric information from in-scope travelers as they exit through land POEs.
	Output: Verification or failure to verify that the biographic and biometric data presented by travelers at POEs match with associated DHS records.
6.0 Response Guidelines
Respondents to this RFI/SS must provide information describing the suggested technologies, products, and biometric matching processes that are included in the solution. If the respondents solution is based on fingerprints, IDENT in its current form will provide the matching capability needed to verify identity. If some other biometric modality is part of the solution described, the relevant matching capability would presumably be added to IDENT. The respondent should describe how other biometrics for land border crossers would be collected at entry to facilitate the proposed solution for land exit. 
As noted elsewhere in this document, respondents should assume that the Government already has capabilities for storing data that associates biometric data with biographic data, network capabilities within the POEs and across DHS, and basic physical infrastructure (e.g., power, communications, and buildings). However, respondents should note any special needs or facilities necessary to accommodate their solutions, especially in the context of less well- developed ports and better developed ports where exit areas may be located adjacent to, but many yards from, the entry facility.
The narrative of the suggested solution should also outline how biometric characteristics will be used for comparison at exit to biometrically verify the identity of travelers. The narrative should also describe how the suggested technology will capture or interoperate with biographic information to be collected at exit.
6.1 Technologies and Products
Descriptive material shall be provided for each product or technology proposed by the respondent for the suggested solution, including devices for initial biometric capture as travelers enters the United States, the capture of biometric information as travelers exit through land POEs, the comparison of biometric exit data against stored data for identity verification, and any other equipment required to enable the suggested solution. The description should include:
	Operational parameters, such as the distance from which biometric data can be captured, whether the biometric sample can be captured while the subject is moving, and environmental considerations, such as temperature, precipitation, dust, dirt, and illumination requirements.
	Performance parameters, such as biometric read rates (how long data capture takes and how many in-scope travelers can be processed simultaneously), factors that impact performance (such as heat, humidity, or physical barriers between the reader and the traveler), and sources of capture or comparison errors.
	Test reports or results that demonstrate how the performance parameters were calculated.
	Equipment specifications, such as size, power, and communication and location requirements (e.g., outside and unprotected, office environment, and computer room controlled conditions).
	Description of the maturity of the devices (e.g., whether these devices are currently in use in an operational environment, in testing, or in the conceptual or design stage).
	Operations and maintenance requirements that would have an impact on large-scale deployments to the full range of ports described in this RFI/SS.
6.2 Biometric Matching Processes
US-VISIT currently uses fingerprints as the biometric modality for verifying traveler identity and so has extensive knowledge and existing capability in this area. IDENT, the system that provides the DHS biometric identity service, also is capable of extensions for matching on multiple biometric modalities. If the suggested solution includes the use of biometric data other than fingerprints, the respondent shall provide information to address the following:
	Content of biometric data stored (e.g., image or mathematical representation of data).
	Any biometric needed to be captured at entry to facilitate the exit process for those individuals exiting via a land border.
	Approach for comparison of biometric data.
	Uniqueness of biometrics captured (e.g., provide the probability that two individuals will have identical biometric data in a population of several hundred million, as will be contained eventually in IDENT for fingerprints).
	Results for a comparison of biometric data (e.g., whether there is an absolute match/no match result or a list of potential matches is provided).
	Approach to resolution if automated equipment cannot confirm whether there is a complete match between the data captured at exit and the stored biometric data for a single individual.
	The algorithm used for the basis of comparison (e.g., whether the matching is based on a proprietary matching algorithm or published biometric standards)
	Description of the maturity of the biometric matching process (e.g., whether the suggested matching process is currently in use in an operational environment, in testing, or in the design stage).
	Compliance with relevant capture, data formatting, compression, communication, and other standards per the information available via the www.biometrics.gov/standards Web site.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the lead responsibility within the federal government to protect the health of the civilian population against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, and deployment of effective medical countermeasures.  On July 21, 2004 President Bush signed into law the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-276) specifically mandating the development and accelerated acquisition of countermeasures to address chemical, biological, and radiological/nuclear (CBRN) threats.  The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-417) codified HHS as the lead of Federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan (or any successor plan such as the current National Response Framework).  The legislation also specified that one of the duties of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is to oversee advanced research, development, and procurement of qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within ASPR is responsible for coordinating the advanced research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures needed for the mitigation or treatment of radiation injuries. This is a Request for Information (RFI) on current and new technologies developed for measurement of individual radiation doses using biodosimetry tools (such as devices and bioassays) that might be employed in the management of a radiologic or nuclear event. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government (USG) to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information should remain with the USG and will not be returned.

*** OBJECTIVES *** As stated in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Implementation Plan for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Threats, HHS regards radiological and nuclear agents as a significant threat to national security.  Biodosimetry capability will be essential for medical management of those acutely exposed to radiation and is integral to triage and management processes. Medical decision tools and processes that will be used for medical triage must allow for rapid, rational initiation of necessary medical intervention, including medical countermeasures, in the midst of a large-scale emergency. 

The USG has estimated that over 1 million people may seek information on their personal risk (radiation exposure level), if an event (such as a 10 kiloton detonation of an improvised nuclear device) occurs in a large metropolitan area.  There will be a need for immediate triage of these individuals within 48 hours of the event to determine a first-pass identification of subjects receiving greater than a 2 Gy exposure.  Individuals exposed at levels exceeding 2 Gy will need immediate treatment and further evaluation with more sophisticated and precise methods to ascertain their absorbed dose.  BARDA is seeking information on dosimetry systems or tools (such as devices, bioassays, biomarkers and tests) that can be used to quickly assess an individuals radiation dose after large radiological/nuclear events.

The USG is seeking information on products that can satisfy one or more of the following Objectives: 

OBJECTIVE 1:  Self-Assessment Dosimetry Tools:  A personal self-assessment tool for immediate determination of exposure to ionizing radiation at doses >2Gy which is immediately interpretable by the handler using minimal handling.  The USG prefers an interpretive mechanism that requires no processing.  The tool must be accurate, rugged (i.e. works under possible adverse environmental conditions), maintains reliability over time even under adverse conditions, and, requires no sample preparation or handling.  Ideally the tool should be portable and may be included in any contemporary personal domestic platform, hold the information for at least one week, and be capable of reporting exposures >2 Gy with a stated statistical certainty.  If electronic, the device or tool should be able to continue to operate reliably and continuously following exposure to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) of sufficient magnitude to disable standard personal electronic platform circuitry.

OBJECTIVE 2:  Quick, Rapid, High Throughput (up to 1 million assays in 48 hours), Dosimetry Assays:  In addition to the self-assessment tool in Objective 1, the USG seeks information on a high throughput tool capable of up to 1 million assays in 48 hours (multiple stations acceptable), that is of low cost, and simple to operate and interpret.  The tool should be capable of measuring a subjects exposure to ionizing radiation when greater than 2Gy with accuracy and precision with a stated statistical certainty.  The tool should also be rugged for in-field use under potentially adverse environmental conditions.  The device should be portable and capable of operating from a self-contained power supply.  The source of the assays biomarker(s) should be preferably procured from subjects non-invasively (e.g., sputum, urine, fingernails).  

OBJECTIVE 3:  A Dose-Ranging (0.5  10 Gy) Assessment:  USG seeks information on an analysis tool that can assess >200,000 assays over a one week period (multiple stations acceptable) and determine with a stated accuracy and precision an individuals radiation exposures over the range of 0.5 Gy to 10 Gy .  The tool may be used up to several days after an event, may require field ruggedness, an internal power source, and minimal use of reagents for sample preparation and analysis. 

OBJECTIVE 4:  A Gold Standard Assay:  The USG seeks information on a tool that can provide accurate and precise results with a stated statistical certainty over the range of 0.01 - 10 Gy.  The tool may be a laboratory-based single or multiple assay system, sensitive and specific, and useful for accurate post-event follow-up of patients who have been stabilized and removed from a restrictive environment or original event environment. Methods requiring extensive sample preparation (i.e. hours) along with days to weeks for assay time, or use of exotic reagents, are not excluded from consideration, but cost of the test is a consideration. 

Each of these needs has negotiable levels of accuracy.  The techniques and biomarkers should be validated and confounding factors addressed.  For each Objective, the tools should be able to determine a persons exposure to ionizing radiation and inform medical personnel attending the subject so that the patient is triaged appropriately (no treatment/treatment).  Bioassay systems or methods employed in Objectives 1 and 2 requiring instrumentation should be robust in terms of control of signal drift, power stability, and operation in compromising environments (operable outside of standard room temperature, humidity, dust, and other controllable conditions).  In Objectives 3 and 4 , the USG is seeking tools that are envisioned to be hospital-ready and operable under controlled standard laboratory conditions and that may require more time per assay and have improved sensitivity and specificity for assessing patients with lower exposures (0.01 Gy  2 Gy) to allow for extended follow-up of medical therapeutic interventions. 

This is a new effort for BARDA and there are no incumbent contractors. Organizations that currently develop or manufacture devices and bioassay systems that can meet the Objectives in this RFI or that have technologies, devices, or manufacturing capabilities under development that are targeted to these Objectives are invited to submit statements of their product to BARDA in a White Paper format described below:


White Paper Format:
White Papers may include narrative, pictures, figures, tables, and charts in a legible size and must be accompanied by a one-page QUAD chart (printable as its own separate page; see example below). 

Overall White Paper Format details are:
 Paper Size  8.5-by-11-inch paper
 Margins  1 inch
 Spacing  Single- or double-spaced

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil OR Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, michael.tierney1@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Incontinence Products Pediatric Diapers. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR>Point of Contact:  Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, michael.tierney1@us.army.mil, or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $17,417.96.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Incontinence Products  Pediatric Diapers.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a.	At a minimum, this includes disposable absorbent diapers, pediatric sizes, with adhesive closure tabs.  Sizes to include; those to fit preemies, neonates and pediatric wearers from 1 lb up to and including 37 lbs. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.  <BR>b.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Incontinence Products- Pediatric Diapers product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submission. (Note that Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), (currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor), for distribution of Incontinence Products- Pediatric Diapers in the Southeast Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.) Provide supporting documentation (four digit number) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.   <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quotes on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendors MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendors MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Diapers backing protects linen from wetness. <BR>a.   The products ability to protect linen from wetness will also protect patient from   <BR>      contact with skin irritation from bodily fluids.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting. <BR>c.   Clinician will inspect patients linen for signs of wetness during diaper use.<BR>2.  (Patient Safety) Pediatric Diaper draws wetness away from patients skin. <BR>a.   Drawing wetness away from patients skin will help prevent skin breakdown/damage due to contact with skin irritant (i.e. bodily fluids).<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   During patient assessments clinician will inspect whether patients skin remains dry while when diaper is damp.<BR>3.   (Patient Safety) Re-sealable closure tabs remain adhesive after multiple uses. <BR>a.   Re-sealable closure tabs allow for multiple opening and closing episodes to facilitate  <BR>      frequent skin assessments without altering diapers proper position.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will pull sealed tab, on side of diaper, open& inspect patients skin <BR>      condition and then close and reseal the adhesive closure tab.  The clinician will visually and manually assess that closure tabs remain adhesive after multiple opening and closure procedures.<BR>4.    (Patient Safety) Diaper does not tear or fall apart during use. <BR>            a.   An intact diaper protects patient from skin irritation caused by bodily fluids.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will visibly observe whether diaper tears or falls apart during use (ex: patient repositioning self or clinicians repositioning patient).<BR>5.    (Patient Safety) Diapers elastic waist and leg bands provide a tailored non-leak fit.<BR>a.    Elastic waist and leg bands that adapt to various widths provide a comfortable fit while helping prevent wetness to linen and other body parts thus eliminating skin irritation.<BR>	b.    This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.    Clinician will manually stretch waist and leg bands and visually observe that bands return to original position (evaluating elastic memory).  While patient is wearing diaper, clinician will visually observe that leg and waist bands remain snug to patient thus providing a non- leak condition. <BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 12 JUNE 2008 4:00 PM EDT.<BR><BR>

Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications & documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Incontinence Products  Under Pads.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a.	At a minimum, this includes disposable absorbent under-pads (fluff and layered) with a protective back sheet available in various sizes, with underpad dimensions ranging from a length of 10 inches to 36 inches and a width ranging from 16 inches to 36 inches. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.  <BR>b.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Incontinence Products- Under Pads product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submission. (Note that Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), (currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor), for distribution of Incontinence Products- Under Pads in the Southeast Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.) Provide supporting documentation (four digit number) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.   <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quotes on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Incontinence Products-Under Pads, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendors MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendors MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Under Pads backing protects linen from wetness. <BR>a.   The products ability to protect linen from wetness will also protect patient from   <BR>      contact with skin irritation from bodily fluids.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting. <BR>c.   Clinician will inspect patients linen for signs of wetness during under pad use.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) Under Pad draws wetness away from patients skin. <BR>a.   Drawing wetness away from patients skin will help prevent skin breakdown/damage due to contact with skin irritant (i.e. bodily fluids).<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   During patient assessments clinician will inspect whether patients skin remains dry while when under pad is damp.<BR>3.	(Patient Safety) Under Pad does not tear or fall apart during use. <BR>            a.   An intact under pad protects patient from skin irritation caused by bodily fluids.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will visibly observe whether under pad tears or falls apart during use (ex: patient repositioning self or clinicians repositioning patient).<BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 12 JUNE 2008 4:00 PM EDT.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil OR Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, michael.tierney1@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Incontinence Products Adult Briefs. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR>Point of Contact:  Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, michael.tierney1@us.army.mil, or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $18,821.53.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.

Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications & documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a.	At a minimum, this includes disposable absorbent Adult Briefs or Diapers with elastic tape tabs.  These adult briefs must be available in small, medium, large and extra large sizes. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.  <BR>b.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs product line.  Must provide the DAPA number with initial submission. (Note that Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), (currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor), for distribution of Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs in the Southeast Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendors Must provide supporting documentation (four digit number) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.   <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quotes on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Incontinence Products-Adult Briefs, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendors MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendors MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>1.   (Patient Safety) The Adult Briefs outer lining protects linen/clothing from wetness. <BR>a.   The Adult Briefs ability to protect linen/clothing from wetness will protect patient from contact with skin irritation from bodily fluids.  It will also improve patient confidence regarding body image.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will visually inspect patients linen/clothing, for signs of wetness, during the <BR>      period when adult briefs are in use.<BR>2.   (Patient Safety) The Adult Brief draws wetness away from patients skin. <BR>a.   Drawing wetness away from patients skin will help prevent skin breakdown/damage due to contact with skin irritant (i.e. bodily fluids).<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting. <BR>c.   During patient assessments clinician will inspect whether patients skin remains dry   <BR>      when Adult Brief is damp.<BR>3.   (Patient Safety) Re-sealable closure tabs remain adhesive after multiple uses. <BR>a.   Re-sealable closure tabs allow for multiple opening and closing episodes to facilitate  <BR>      frequent skin assessments without altering Adult Briefs proper position.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will pull sealed tab, on side of Adult Brief, open& inspect patients skin <BR>      condition and then close and reseal the adhesive closure tab.  The clinician will visually and manually assess that closure tabs remain adhesive after multiple opening and closure procedures.<BR>4.   (Patient Safety) The Adult Brief does not tear or fall apart during use.<BR>            a.   An intact Adult Brief protects patient from skin irritation caused by bodily fluids.<BR>	b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>	c.   Clinician will visibly observe whether Adult Brief tears or falls apart during use <BR>                  (i.e. patient repositioning self, clinicians repositioning patient).<BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 12 JUNE 2008 4:00 PM EDT.<BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil OR MS Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Incentive Spirometers.      <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Incentive Spirometers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Incentive Spirometers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR><BR>Point of Contact:  Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil, or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incentive Spirometers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $33,944.42. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications & documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation and pricing analysis.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR> The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>  <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Incentive Spirometer products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR>a.	At a minimum this includes Incentive Spirometers that are disposable volumetric exercisers (2500 ml to 5000 ml), flow incentive spirometers with adjustable flow ranges, both with adjustable goal indicators.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.  <BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Incentive Spirometer product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Incentive Spirometers in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Incentive Spirometer products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deem relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide products that are Latex safe/free.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc,) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance and Pricing Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request literature and product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their literature and samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  <BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	(Encourage patients active involvement in care)The internal float device is able to move freely within inspiratory flow chamber. <BR>a.	A freely moving float device is able to be raised by patients inspired breaths.  This provides respiratory exercise. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will turn Incentive Spirometer upside down and observe that internal float device slowly falls to the bottom of the chamber.    <BR>2.	(Encourage patients active involvement in care) Adjustable goal indicator is easy to reposition. <BR>a.	An adjustable goal indicator allows clinician and patient to assess exercise progress.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will manually slide goal indicator up and down a long the side of the incentive spirometer to assure its ease of repositioning.   <BR>3.	(Encourage patients active involvement in care) Graphics indicating inspiratory volume are clearly marked on the spirometer. <BR>a.	Highly visible graphic (indicating inspiratory flow rate volume) helps patient perform and monitor their own breathing exercises without supervision.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will visually observe that inspiratory flow rate volume can be clearly identified by user...<BR>       4.	 (Patient comfort) Mouthpiece fits comfortably.  <BR>a.	A tight seal of mouth piece is necessary for efficient inspiratory exercise results.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will visually observe that patient is able to acquire a tight seal on mouthpiece.<BR>	<BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO will request pricing quotes from those vendors who were found to be technical acceptable.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 12 JUNE 2008 4:00 PM EDT.<BR>

<a href="mailto:Vicki.Whiteman@usmc.mil">CEOss Contracting Officer:</a>
<DESC>RFI --The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY09.  This notice provides information for both current and new vendors wishing to participate in the Commands Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August, 2002.   To date, $1.27+ billion in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $100K to $19.5 million.   CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404, which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  Thirty competitively awarded BPAs have been established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.   
CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated FY09 Command requirements.   Additionally, CEOss assesses the need for new prime vendor awards in selected domains.   For FY09, openings are anticipated in all four domains, ALA, BA, SE, and ES domains; unrestricted as to business size.  However, in accordance with small business goals established for Department of Defense, beginning FY09 CEOss preference for small business subcontracting (or prime) goals of a minimum of 10% at the BPA level are desired.  Beginning FY10, mandatory small business goals at the BPA level will be implemented at a minimum of 10%, subject to adjustment.  A preparatory workshop will be held for those firms interested in participating as new CEOss prime vendors on 03 June 2008, which will provide detailed information about Command requirements and RFI submission guidance.    Vendors are required to register for this workshop by submitting an email to the ACSS mailbox (acss@usmc.mil) NLT 27 May 2008.   Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and attendance may be restricted due to space constraints.   
CEOSS BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-procurement transaction processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.   Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.   There is no maximum dollar limit on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.   There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering (SE), Business and Analytical (BA), Engineering and Scientific (ES), and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative (ALA).   Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA and only one submission per vendor is allowed.    To qualify for consideration in the ALA domain you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or LOGWORLD (874 V) schedule.   To qualify in the BA domain, you must possess a FABS (520), MOBIS (874), or Training Aids & Devices, Instructor-Led Training, Course Development, Test Administration (69) schedule.   To qualify in the SE domain, you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), Environmental Services (899), IT Services & Support (70), or Lab Testing & Analysis (873) schedule.  To qualify in the ES domain, you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or IT Services & Support (70) schedule.  Although vendors may have a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships across the domains are unrestricted.    
INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CEOSS APPLICANTS:    To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors must submit the following information NLT 24 June 2008.   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages, that identifies their firms capabilities within a domain of prime interest, to include business size, team composition, business/management strategy, relevant experience, and rate discounting policy.  In addition, a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule shall also be included in the submission.  All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.   All business sizes will be considered for the domain openings.   However, based upon responses to this Request for Information (RFI), ACSS will determine if there is viability in pursuing restricted competition in any of the open domain(s), however the RFI does not guarantee award of any BPA in any or all domain(s).   Vendor submissions will be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers each firms pricing and technical capabilities within the existing pool of domain participants.   
Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered, will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation that will be issued NLT 14 July 2008.   Responses will be due within thirty (30) calendar days, inclusive of teaming arrangements.  Competitive selection and award of BPAs is anticipated to occur NLT 25 August 2008.   RFI responses can be mailed to the following address:   COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM CODE ACSS, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.    Responses submitted by FED-EX or UPS should be sent to the following address:   COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester St., Attn: Ms. Vicki Whiteman, Code ACSS, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), Lakewood, CO, intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Capstone Planning and Control, Inc., 11001 West 120th Avenue, Broomfield, CO 80020, for the acquisition of Database Analyst/Developer services.  

FHWA-CFLHD intends to procure the services of a Database Analyst/Developer that has strong working experience with Microsoft (MS) Access, SQL, Crystal Reports, and MS Office applications.  Additionally, a working knowledge of FHWAs financial accounting system (DELPHI), FoxPro (Tanda), and Discover is highly desired.  CFLHD has been using a MS Access application named Project Analysis and Reporting System (PARS) for the last 3 years to manipulate project data from various database sources.  The output is customized project delivery reports.  The database analyst/developer will advance the development of PARS, maintain the existing database structure and reporting capabilities, as well as develop and maintain new reports.  A good understanding of how FHWAs accounting system is structured is essential to not only mining the correct data, but to identify erroneous and insufficient information.  Also, key is experience with project management information systems CFLHD is currently using Primavera P3e/c and work breakdown structures.  CFLHD also uses Microsoft Windows XP Professional operating system, Microsoft Office applications, and Oracle.

The primary products required are a series of reports that can be generated on-demand, including project performance measurements, resource analysis, historical cost and schedule data, budget, and financial reports.

Tasks identified below are not placed in any priority and will be accomplished in a reasonable order that expedites the improvement and maintenance of the project management information system.  Period of performance for each task will be established during the contract year to allow for the evolution of the system.  The following task descriptions generally describe the work to be accomplished:

Provide technical expertise in custom reporting and data mining solutions.  Responsible for: 

Creating custom reports and SQL stored procedures, responsible for the design, development, delivery, and monitoring of the custom reports;
Custom reporting/data mining solutions; reviewing the feasibility of custom reporting solutions;
Conducting research and provide advice to other information systems professionals regarding the collection, availability, and suitability of data.  Work with users to understand data access and integration needs; 
Developing and maintaining database solutions for, Business Intelligence, Data analysis, Database reporting, Data warehousing and Database replication using SQL databases;
Ensuring the integration of systems through the database structure;
Monitoring database reporting procedures; 
Troubleshooting and resolving database and data problems; and
Collecting and documenting user's requirements.

Develop and maintain the current Microsoft Access information system.  Continue development and maintenance of the Project Analysis and Reporting System (PARS) used to integrate and manage project-related data.  The primary use of the system is to combine project information, labor and non-labor, from the FHWAs financial accounting system (DELPHI), the Project Management Information System (PMIS), Discoverer, and FoxPro.  This combination of data is to create timely and accurate reports.

MS Access or Web Browser Data Entry Screens.  Develop and maintain either MS Access or web browser forms for data entry and editing by CFLHD personnel.  Design these forms to include filtering capabilities to provide ease-of-use.  At a minimum, PARS will have single-user capability, so that one person can enter data into the PARS database.

Report Generation.  Advance PARS capability to generate reports that centralize organizational project delivery information.

Report Maintenance.  Maintain and update current reports generated through PARS to reflect changes made to financial accounting file structure and format improvements.  Updates will be required as Delphi/Discoverer/Business Objects/FoxPro/Castle/PMIS systems change.
FLH Annual Report Support.  Create schedule, budget, and project accomplishment datasets for automatic data extraction for the FLH Annual Report.  Include quarterly update capability for CFL internal reviews.

Training.  Provide technical guidance, informal training, and general assistance to CFLHD Project Delivery staff in the operation of PARS and in the understanding of data provided through PARS.  Training is given on an as needed basis and is coordinated with training efforts provided by Project Control Analysts.

Develop and maintain a reporting process that collects historical hours and costs from the PMIS.  Translate Primavera information into usable reports.  In addition, develop and maintain a process using the existing CFL database to collect historical costs from project related Architect/Engineering (A/E) contracts.  Structure the application to allow Project Managers to input data through PARS.  The data is currently maintained in A/E Fee Estimate Labor Cost Excel spreadsheets.  Develop a report format that resembles the A/E Fee Estimate Labor Cost Excel spreadsheets.

Resource Analysis Report.  Develop a monthly resource analysis report with the capability of showing resource availability by individual or functional discipline.  The report will provide the: Total Limit of Availability, Total Allocation, and Total Under/Over allocation.  In addition, depict the allocation data graphically.  The report will also provide an overall functional group assessment of the Schedule Performance Index and Cost Performance Index.  The report will provide an overall view of the program to assist in determining in-house capabilities for current and out-year projects.  Separate functional discipline reports will need to be generated to provide the level of detail necessary for complete understanding of the data by CFLHD project delivery staff.

Budget Estimate System and Reporting.  Continue to integrate budget data with the PMIS.  Advance the development of project specific Budget Reports and subsequent Budget Summary Reports for use by Planning and Programs (P&P).  Develop the file type and format to meet the needs of P&P.  Generate the reports to provide accurate and current resource, schedule, travel, miscellaneous expenses, agreement, and task order data at the time of the budget call.  Generation of the report must allow for user filtering capabilities:  functional manager, delivery method, funding source, etc.

Performance Measures.  Develop, maintain, and update performance measurement tracking applications using the PMIS and PARS, such as periodic comparison of baselining projections versus actual completion dates, durations, resource utilization, earned value analysis, and other indicators.  Generation of performance indicators will be on a monthly basis.  Provide the system modifications and support to perform earned value analysis (EVA) and reporting.  Interim reports may be necessary to account for variability in project data.  One such report would be the generation of a Variance Analysis Report (VAR) to track performance trends.  The VAR would be used to summarize project SPI and CPI scores and provide comment fields for explaining project issues and actions taken.  The report would be used to track past, current, and future project health issues.

Timesheet Report Maintenance.  Maintain timesheet reports to support Primavera Timesheets.  Updates will be required to support migration to Castle payroll system and phase-out FoxPro Payroll and Account Table.

Document Entire Project Analysis and Reporting System (PARS) into a System/User Manual.  Document procedures and protocols used within the PARS software to keep data accurate and consistent.  This includes describing report formats and data definitions.
CFLHD & National Park Service (NPS) Project Status website data.

Coordinate with CFLHDs Webmaster to link key PMIS project data directly to CFLHD/NPS websites.  Coordination with other CFLHD and NPS staff is required.

Database Integration.   Connect project information residing in the various databases using PARS to generate comprehensive reports.  Coordination with CFLHDs Oracle programmers will be necessary.

Project Controls Team Support.  Provide one-time reports, trouble-shooting, and other support to the Project Controls Team (e.g., remove orphaned records from P3e/c database, system recommendations, analysis, and advise).  Specific skills and knowledge:

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Engineering (or equivalent work experience) 
5 plus years of experience in database analysis and development
Proficiency working with SQL 2000 and SQL 2005, specifically in the areas of query and stored procedure development

<DESC>This announcement corrects Solicitation Number GLBA001-08, to reflect a proper Solicitation Number of GLBA-CRUISESHIP-08, include the park website where the prospectus is posted, and corrects ths issue date to May 20, 2008.

The National Park Service (NPS) is issuing a prospectus under which multiple concession contracts may be awarded for the operation of cruise ship services within Glacier Bay National Park.  The contracts will include the initial allocation of a limited number of vessel use days in Glacier Bay proper during June through August of each year of the contract term.  The anticipated term of the contracts will be January 1, 2010 - September 30, 2019. 
The solicitation, selection and award of the concession contracts will be conducted pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51.  In addition, Holland America Line, Inc. and Princess Cruises, Inc. are historical operators, based on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Section 134, eligible to be awarded contracts for their historical (prior to January 1, 1979) level of use (39 and 32 vessel use days in June through August, respectively).  Therefore, the NPS intends to award concession contracts to these operators for that level of use, pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Section 1307 (16 USC 3197) and 36 CFR 13.310.  Generally, historical operators have a right to continue to provide the same kind and level of service that they were legally engaged in providing prior to January 1, 1979.  The two companies can also compete for additional use days for the June through August period. 
The prospectus is available on the Glacier Bay website at: http://www.nps.gov/glba/parkmgmt/cruise-ships.htm.  Hardcopies are available upon request.  If you are planning to submit a proposal, we recommend that you advise the park of your interest and provide a contact person, e-mail address and telephone number.  Those who have requested hard copies or advised the park of their interest will be placed on the mailing list to receive (via e-mail) any updates, amendments to the prospectus, and questions received and answers provided by the NPS which may be issued during the response period.  This information will also be posted on the website listed above. 
Proposals must be received at National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, 240 West 5th Avenue, Room 114, Anchorage, Alaska 99501-2327, no later than 4:00 p.m. on August 18, 2008 in order to be considered and evaluated.  Requests for the prospectus and other inquiries may be made to David Nemeth, Glacier Bay National & Preserve, PO Box 140, Gustavus, Alaska 99826, phone 907 697-2624, or e-mail David_Nemeth@nps.gov.  
The opportunity to apply for cruise ship vessel services into Glacier Bay National Park shall remain open throughout the contract term. However, it is expected that all of the available use-days for June through August of each year will be awarded during the initial allocation to companies who submit proposals by the time and date referenced above.  This "open" solicitation will allow additional Cruise Ship operators to submit proposals to provide services in the under-utilized shoulder and off-season and will allow additional operators an opportunity to utilize prime season use-days which may become available over the course of the contract term.

<DESC>Provide all labor, equipment and materials necessary to collect soil data for 400 points, in the form of 40 transects of 5 points each, and examined to a depth of 40 inches or to the top of the substratum, whichever occurs first. Minimum data requirements from all points will include: slope, surface texture, family texture, drainage class, depth to carbonates (if applicable), color (hue) of the subsoil, location- using a GPS, vegetation, soil series (best fit), and any other notes necessary to properly classify the soil. In addition, erosion class will be evaluated on the eroded phase map units, and depth to bedrock will be noted for shallow and moderately deep phase map units.  Additionally, a brief summary will be written for each transect, addressing such items as: accuracy of linework, suggestions for changes to the map unit, notes regarding soil classification (fits or doesnt fit, and if not, why?), potential for map unit to fit into a standard 0-3, 3-8, 8-15, 15-25, 25-35% slope class, apparent inclusions in map unit that werent hit by a transect point, identification of one potential pedon description site which best represents the map unit and comment on its potential as a typical pedon site.

Transects will be run across the map unit in such a way as to best represent the contents of the entire map unit (i.e.- perpendicular to hill slopes, streams, etc.). Transect points will be at a minimum interval of 100 ft., and will not be collected within 20 ft. of a road. However, observations from road cuts may be used for making supplemental notes regarding the map unit.  All transect locations (polygons) must be approved by Government Representative before any observation is taken.

Transects of the same map unit will be randomly generated, in order to capture the variability across the entire extent of the map unit. However, transects of different assigned map units may occur from the same tract of land or same general vicinity if randomly selected.

Maps identifying areas to be transected will be provided.  The Contractor will mark the transect location on these maps and return them along with the corresponding transect data.  Also, based on field observations, suggested improvements/ changes to soil mapping will be made on these maps. 

The Contractor will be responsible for obtaining landowner permission

A firm fixed price contract will be awarded.  Performance time is June 9, 2008 thru September 30, 2008.  Estimated price range = less than $25,000.00

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has designed and constructed a new hyperspectral confocal fluorescence microscope.  This patent-pending technology has been combined with Sandias unique and proprietary multivariate algorithms and software to form a complete system for the extraction of quantitative image information from the hyperspectral images.  The hyperspectral microscope uses laser excitation and collects 512 spectral emission wavelengths at each voxel in the image over the spectral range from 500 to 800 nm at a spectral resolution of 1-3 nm and at imaging rate of 8300 spectra/sec (with extension to 64,000 spectra/sec in the near future).  Our proprietary multivariate curve resolution (MCR) software allows us to very rapidly discover all emitting fluorescence species in the image and to determine their relative concentrations throughout the image without any a priori information.  With this new system, many fluorophores can be monitored simultaneously without cross talk to achieve higher throughput, greater quantitative accuracy, and increased reliability.  The hyperspectral microscope has been used for multiplexed live-cell imaging at diffraction-limited spatial resolutions in a variety of biological applications.  Included in the hyperspectral imaging system is spectral image viewing software to view both the raw image data as well as the results from the MCR analyses.  
Sandia is interested in partnering with microscope manufacturers through licensing agreements for the commercialization of this technology. Sandia anticipates hosting a workshop in late July to showcase this technology and to allow interested parties the opportunity to view this technology in operation.

The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10423, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25.

Background
The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing teflon filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM-2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.
EPA obtains the filters each year from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the States.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the contractor shall ship the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.

<DESC>Amendment 1 issued 5/20/08.  Due to system issues the market survey has been extended to 3:00 p.m. CST, May 27, 2008.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning the acquisition of thermal flight strips, NSN 7530-01-450-6963, for air traffic control operations.  These flight strips are an essential tool in tracking aircraft.  The flight strips are to be manufactured in accordance with FAA Specification FAAD-F-1374, dated August 8, 2002, attached.  Estimated annual quantity for the base year and all option years is 14,000 boxes per year.
The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contract with fixed unit prices, with a base year and four 1-year options, for the acquisition of these thermal flight strips.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 323112.
Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  
The acquisition will be accomplished in two phases: (1) offeror submission of non-converted material and thermal flight strips (bid samples) for testing and evaluation by the FAA against established specifications and standards; and (2) issuance of a Request for Offer (RFO) for submission of price proposals by offerors having successfully completed the first phase.  Offeror's bid samples will be evaluated according to published criteria contained in the FAA's Screening Information Request 1 (SIR 1) package.  The FAA will assess the offeror's capability to meet the FAA's requirements.  Only those offeror's whose bid samples and technical documentation are found to be acceptable will be afforded an opportunity to participate in the second phase of the acquisition process.  The second phase, which will be accommodated by SIR 2, involves the issuance of a RFO and submission of priced proposals.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror submitting the lowest evaluated price in accordance with the terms of the RFO.
Interested vendors shall:1)	Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.2)	Submit requests for SIR 1 in writing.
SIR 1 will only be provided to vendors responding to this market survey.
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address: Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov and reference Market Survey No. DTFAAC-08-R-54856.  Vendors must respond by 3:00 p.m. (CST), May 27, 2008.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these products.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
Any responses received after 3:00 p.m. CST, May 27, 2008, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, incorporated by reference in the solicitation.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis modification is to answer ten (10) vendor questions and amend the solicitation, where necessary.<br><br>

Additionally, the synopsis as published in modification 03, (see above) is modified to correct a discrepancy in the due date for proposals.  The proposal due date is changed to read as follows: --- (xvi) OFFERS DUE: 5 June 2008<br><br><br>


Questions and Answers<br><br>


----QUESTION 1:  From a commercial perspective...what...is currently being used, in this instance TESA tape, is slightly different than the exact thickness called out in the spreadsheet [PWS].  [Please provide] a clarification on the precision of the thickness desired... <br><br>

----ANSWER 1: The solicitation is amended to add the following note after Table C-2, on page C 11 of 25.  "Note: This requirement is for commercially available data label materials.  If commercially available materials do not come in the precise thicknesses called out in the Performance Work Statement, offerors should propose the commercially available thicknesses that are closest to those specified and clearly indicate the thicknesses offered." <br><br><br>


----QUESTIONS 2: Para 7.3.1.4 ends without completing the sentence.  [Please clarify.] <br><br>
ANSWER 2: Somehow this paragraph got cut off when converting to a pdf file.  Paragraph 7.3.1.4. should read as follows: 

"7.3.1.4        The IUID Data Label processing solution shall provide the means for the requestor to annotate the request as having been successfully fulfilled and to submit a request for corrective action if the IUID Data Label request is not filled as originally placed." <br><br><br>

  
----QUESTION 3: Para 7.3.2.1 states in Phase 1 and 2 DOD IUID registry performed by the SNT IUID Project Office and Para 7.3.2.2 states in Phase 2 the contractor shall register the items within the DOD IUID registry.  [Please clarify.] <br><br>

----ANSWER 3:  The first sentence in Section C, paragraph 7.3.2.1 is REPLACED with the following --- <br><br>

"Phase 1 & Phase 2 - UII and Birth Record Transmission - The IUID Data Label processing solution shall enable the SNT IUID Project Office to obtain, on at least a weekly basis, all of the UIIs assigned by the Contractor along with birth record information and transmission date.  During Phase 1 the SNT IUID Project Office will keep this information for their records and will send data pertaining to the AFEMS pilot to the DoD IUID registry.  The Contractor shall send the data pertaining to labels ordered by the Air Force depots to the DoD IUID registry.  During Phase 2 the SNT IUID Project Office will keep all of this information for their records and the Contractor shall register all of the information with the DoD IUID registry, as stipulated in Paragraph 7.3.2.2, below.  The processing solution shall include the means for the Government requestor to indicate that IUID Data Labels, received by the Government, have been affixed to the designated assets.  The Contractor, through this means, shall ensure that labels have been successfully affixed to the intended asset before items are registered in the DoD IUID Registry." <br><br>

ADDITIONALLY, Section C, (Government Furnished Items - Data) Paragraph 11.1.4 is amended to add an additional sentence at the end.  The amended paragraph reads as follows: <br><br>

11.1.4	The Air Force personnel who request IUID Data Labels shall provide the Contractor with data specific to the tangible asset(s) being labeled for inclusion in the data matrix.  This data shall be provided as part of the request process.  They shall also provide verification that the labels have been placed on the designated assets through the web-based interface.<br><br><br>


----QUESTION 4:  Para B.4 states a ceiling of 9,461,400 and Section C Para 2 states an order ceiling of 7.2M.  What is the ceiling amount? <br><br>

----ANSWER 4:  Section C, Paragraph 2, the reference to the approximate number of data labels is changed to read "approximately 9.46 million IUID Data Labels".   Also, the last sentence in Section C, Paragraph 8.2 is amended to read as follows:  The government anticipates a contract total of approximately 9.46 million labels by the end of the last option year.<br><br><br>


----QUESTION 5: Section C Para 10.6 states key personnel designation is not applicable to this PWS and Section M Para M.2 Evaluation of Technical Capability states that this evaluation will look at the competencies, skill, knowledge, and experience of the management and staff in relation to the attributes needed to execute this project.  Do we need a section that describes key personnel and their qualification? <br><br>

----ANSWER 5:  The Key Personnel provision, if implemented, requires (1) that the contractor perform the work with personnel who possess essential qualifications and who are therefore specifically named in the contract and (2) that key personnel substitutions only be made after the contractor receives government approval to ensure that they (the replacements) meet the qualification standards originally established in the solicitation. This contract does NOT require key personnel.  The government does, however, want information about the offeror's personnel along with other information about the offeror's resources, as specified in Section M, so it can determine which offeror can give the government the greatest level of confidence that it will perform this contract satisfactorily. <br><br><br>


----QUESTION 6: When customer MIPRs funds for an estimated quantity and price to GSA and the contractor is awarded the task order, is contractor obligated to provide labels and quantity exactly match the task order, or what the customer order transaction at a later date? ---<br><br>
 
Scenario:  GSA CO provides a task order to the contractor for 1000 vinyl tags at a cost of $5 per label for a total of $5000.    Authorized requestor than orders aluminum tags at a unit cost for $10 a tag with a qty of 500 resulting in a 500 label decrease.   
Question:  Can the authorized requestor order differently than what was place on the task order provided they dont exceed the funded ceiling amount?  The same question arises for quantity discounts.  If the authorized requestors orders in quantities greater than or less than what was originally placed on order this could result in volume discounts being applied or not being applied.  This would constrain or increase the number of tags that could be ordered against the ceiling funded amount.   <br><br>

----ANSWER 6:  It is envisioned that Deliver Orders will specify estimated, not to exceed, ceiling quantities for the various types of labels the client wishes to purchase.  Individual offices will provide the exact material, size, and biometric data to complete the order.  Offices will not be able to exceed the ceiling quantities specified in the delivery order.  The Contractor's web based solution must be able to enforce established delivery order ceilings.  Ceilings can be changed by delivery order modification or increased by placing another delivery order.  If a delivery order is closed without all ordered labels being requested, the delivery order price will be adjusted during close-out.  Because there are too many variables, I can not address how the Government will handle discounts at this time because that will depend on how they are proposed by the Contractor.  I can only say that the Government will handle all aspects of the orders in an equitable manner.  For purposes of evaluating the proposals, offerors should assume that the ceiling quantity of labels will be purchased in the quantities stipulated in solicitation Attachment 1.  The Government, however, can not guarantee the size of any delivery orders, and therefore, if discounts are offered based on the size of individual delivery orders, those discounts will NOT be considered in the evaluation of proposals.  (However, if the contract is otherwise awarded to a firm offering such discounts, the Government will take those discounts during contract performance when they apply.).  Only discounts on total quantities ordered will be considered in the total price used in the best value award determination. <br><br><br>


----QUESTION 7: May we use qty discounts that differ from attachment 1?  Attachment 1 shows a qty discount scenarios of 1,950 (70,200 for aluminum), 320,000, 356,660, 600,000, and 600,000. We would like to consider using a different quantity discount with different price breakpoints. <br><br>  

----ANSWER 7: 
The solicitation does not address or stipulate discounts.  As stated in Section M, paragraphs M.4 and M.5, only the total price will be used in the best value award determination.  How you structure the internal pricing, with or without discounts or cost of living increases, is entirely up to you; however Phase 1 is for a maximum of 78,000 data labels, of which 90% are estimated to be aluminum, as stated in the solicitation.  The AIT PMO reserves the right to move the contract into Phase 2 upon completion and acceptable performance of the web-based ordering solution.  The Government will move any unordered Phase 1 labels to Phase 2 (see solicitation paragraph.B.4 - Quantities).<br><br><br>


----QUESTION 8: In attachment 1 it shows screw holes for materials such as polyester, vinyl, and tesa tape.  The thickness of these materials may not support an attachment device such as a screw or a rivet.  Does the customer require pricing for screw/rivet holes for these materials?  Or should screw/rivet holes be only applicable to steel and aluminum? <br><br>

----ANSWER 8:  The solicitation is amended to add the following note to Table C-2, on Section C page 11 of 25 and on the Vinyl, TESA tape, and Polyester tabs of Attachment 1: 
"Note: The screw and rivet attachment options only apply to aluminum and steel." <br><br><br>


----QUESTION 9:  Are the perforations necessary or required for all the label sizes and types?<br><br>

----ANSWER 9:  Perforations are mandatory for Wright-Patterson AFEMS labels only, but should be available in all cases where label sizes and materials permit.<br><br><br>
 

----QUESTION10: Please advise regarding the reference to DD Form 1423-1s at the end of top paragraph on page F-2 of 3 in solicitation 5TS57070224. <br><br>
 
"A detailed description and information pertaining to each data item is provided on the attached DD Form 1423-1s."<br><br>
 
To date I have not located the referenced DD Form 1423-1s on the web site or as part of the RFP downloads. Where can DD Form 1423-1s be viewed/downloaded?<br><br>
 
----ANSWER 10:  The documents requiring the DD 1423s were not used in this final solicitation.  This reference should have been deleted from the final document.  I apologize for the confusion.  Section F, Paragraph F.3.3, the last sentence as quoted in the question, is deleted in its entirety.  Document contents are either specified in Section C, Performance Work Statement, or should be provided in accordance with standard commercial practice.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the closing date through 04/21/2008.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), intends to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type of contract for this acquisition of various parts for the  Fisher & Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 including but not limited to: Post Scales (for weighing assembly), NSN:  6660-00-228-0258, ASN: D111-3SP119,  F&P part number (P/N) 403C00A12 or equivalent; Punch and Die Assembly, NSN:  6625-00-350-3541, ASN:  D111-8A162,  F&P P/N 625A401U01 or equivalent; Lower Case Assembly, NSN:  6660-01-117-7567, ASN:  D111-1A100-2,  F&P P/N 18312 or equivalent; Funnel, NSN:  6660-00-071-0435, ASN:  D111-1SP105, F&P P/N 351C101U01 or equivalent, these parts are used to support the NWS ASOS program.  These parts must be in accordance with (IAW) Fischer & Porter Company, Parts List for Precipitation Gage-Recorder, for series 35B1558 and 35B1559 (attached).   

The Fischer and Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 was originally manufactured in the early 1980?s for the National Weather Service (NWS).  The F&P consists of two main parts, a rain-collecting pan that will hold a total of about 19.5 inches of rain and an automatic, yet intricate and delicate, weighing and recording mechanism.  Every 15 minutes, a timer activates the recording mechanism and holes are punched into a paper tape (or strip chart) indicating the cumulative amount of collected rainfall to the nearest tenth of an inch using a weight to depth conversion factor.  The paper tape is divided into frames; each individual frame is divided into 24 hour segments.  At the beginning of each month, an observer is tasked with removing the tape and sending it to the local NWS office.  There, it is examined and forwarded to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and publication as official Hourly Precipitation Data.  The F&P (ASN:  D111) is a legacy system in dire need of an upgrade.  This upgrade comes in the form of the Fischer & Porter Upgrade (FPU), in which the existing punch mechanism will be replaced with a digital data recording system.  Until all F&P weighing rain gages can be upgraded at the higher cost FPU, NWS must support the legacy components to sustain the established cooperative network.  Because the F&P weighing rain gage was originally procured from Belfort Instrument Company by part number, they are the only source known to have the drawings and specifications needed to manufacture a part that complies with the F&P Part Numbers as stated herein. 
 
The Government at its discretion may make multiple awards for indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contracts for this equipment, each will cover a five (5) year period.  The Government at its discretion may require first article testing.  The acquisition(s) will be conducted in accordance with the processes set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12.6 ? Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  A solicitation will be issued on or before April 4, 2008 and will be uploaded to the FedBizOpps, the solicitation can also be requested via fax to 816-274-6923, Attn: Carey Marlow or via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov.  The proposal due date and time will be published in the solicitation.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  It will be the responsibility of interested parties to download the solicitation and related documents, and to revisit the site frequently to obtain any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  This solicitation and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-23).  The prices proposed shall be inclusive of all costs.  Firms other than Belfort Instrument Company, interested in this requirement must respond to this notice by submitting demonstrated evidence of its capability and experience in manufacturing the exact part specified and its use in the F&P weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559.  The Central Region Acquisitions Division requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>This modification extends the response date to 9 June 2008.THIS REQUIREMENT IS A 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS (SDVOSB).  Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) and 15 U.S.C. 657(f), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute. Non-SDVOSB firms will not be considered.  Payment and performance bonds will be required.  NAICS code is 238220.  Size standard is $13 million. The Department of the Interior, National Park Service, intends to award a sole-source negotiated firm, fixed-price design-build SDVOSB contract for a project that consists of designing, furnishing, installing, and testing complete fire protection systems for critical buildings at the Dun Glen unit of New River Gorge, National River, West Virginia.  THIS IS CONSIDERED A REMOTE SITE.  These critical buildings include the following:"	Park Quarters Building - 2,585 sq. ft."	Maintenance Building - 5,250 sq. ft."	Ranger Station Building - 4,620 sq. ft.The fire protection systems will include building sprinkler systems, yard mains, water storage tank with fire pump (or a pressurized water storage tank system), complete with all associated piping, valves, and controls. The storage tank shall be sized to provide at least 60 minutes of fire flow (15,000 gallons minimum), and shall have provision for automatic refill from an existing well water system at the site. Fire detection and alarm systems are also required. This project is intended to be awarded as a design-build contract. The Design Build Contractor (DBC) shall analyze the site conditions and propose the most cost effective system which meets NPS requirements. The project will include, but is not limited to the following:"	Evaluate and propose location of water storage tank and routing of fire mains to minimize disturbance of archeologically sensitive areas. Possible tank locations are shown on Attachment 2 in the project scope of services document."	Evaluate and propose the most cost effective type of water storage tank installation, which could include a buried installation, exterior above-ground installation, or indoor installation. Factors to be considered include cost of excavation, freeze protection, and code compliance. Note that NFPA 22 requires full sprinkler coverage for buildings which house water storage tanks. Therefore, an indoor tank proposal must include any upgrades (including fire protection) necessary to meet the full requirements of NFPA 22, for any additional building which may be selected to house an indoor tank."	Evaluate and propose the most cost effective type of storage tank construction, i.e. steel concrete, fiberglass, etc."	Evaluate and propose the most cost effective means of moving the design fire flow through the system, i.e. electric fire pump, diesel fire pump, or compressed air."	Perform any required geotechnical investigations."	Perform any required surveying."	Prepare and submit design development and construction documents for review and approval."	Provide schedule of construction work."	Provide all labor, materials and equipment to construct the project."	Provide as-built record drawings, plus operation and maintenance manuals."	Provide training to Park staff on operation and maintenance of fire suppression systems."	All underground utilities shall be marked with detectable tape or other material such that the location of the utility may be determined without excavation.Construction drawings shall be stamped by an engineer registered in the state of West Virginia. The DBC shall be responsible for all design and construction activities associated with this Statement of Work including, but not limited to, data collection and review, engineering analysis and design, providing written response to NPS review comments, supporting NPS compliance activities (primarily archeology), preparation of construction documents, preparing submitting and securing all necessary permits, providing all materials equipment and labor required for completion of all construction activities, startup and testing of all systems and modified facilities, and contract closeout and documentation. This contract will be broken into two phases: the design and construction document phase and the construction services phase.Dun Glen was the site of an historic hotel which was destroyed by fire in 1930. The NPS desires to avoid disturbing historic artifacts which are presumed to be buried throughout the area. Where excavation is required, archeological investigation will be necessary. The Park's Archeologist will take the lead on testing direction and guidance, as archeological testing will be paid for by the NPS and contracted separately. The amount of excavation and trenching shall, as much as possible, be kept to a minimum and routed to avoid sensitive locations as much as practical. All excavation is subject to NPS approval. All correspondence regarding the solicitation contents or general questions must be addressed in writing on the firm's letterhead, containing a point of contact (POC), the solicitation number, and phone and fax numbers and must be addressed or e-mailed to the Contract Specialist listed.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis amendment is to incorporate  Note 22.  The following reflects the synopsis restated for clarity: 
This synopsis informs interested parties that the NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to procure the production of fourteen (14) Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) sets, thirteen (13) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) 4.0.1 sets, and multiple configurations of equipment upgraded as part of Aegis Modernization (AMOD), to address the requirements of Fiscal Years (FYs) 2009 through 2013, from Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (Lockheed Martin MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey. MMSP equipment sets will be procured for three (3) sites (the Combat System Engineering Development Site (CSEDS), Aegis Training and Readiness Center (ATRC), and Surface Combat Systems Center (SCSC)), and eleven (11) ships, for a total of fourteen (14) sets. MMSP consolidates the BMD performance requirements and the SPY-1D(V) radar signal processor functionality into a single set of enclosures. The production lead time for MMSP equipment is twenty-two (22) months, requiring a production start date of February 2009 in order to ensure that deliveries to the Aegis sites occur in FY 2011, to support fleet installation beginning in FY 2012. The BMD 4.0.1 equipment sets will be procured for one (1) site (ATRC) and twelve (12) ships, for a total of thirteen (13) sets. The BMD 4.0.1 equipment set consists of the BMD 4.0.1 signal processor, the BMD computing suite, and the Kill Assessment System, and six additional technical refresh kits with spares. The BMD 4.0.1 signal processor, developed by Lockheed Martin MS2 under contract N00024-03-C-6110 as part of the BMD 4.0.1 combat system, is critical to the design configuration and production of MMSP, which is necessary to support the schedule for AMOD. The production lead time for BMD 4.0.1 equipment is twenty-four (24) months, and deliveries begin in FY 2011. AMOD upgrade equipment is required for three (3) sites (SCSC, ATRC, and the Integrated Warfare Systems Laboratory (IWSL)), and twenty-three (23) ships, for a total of twenty-six (26) equipment sets. The upgrades will ensure that the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) interfaces properly with the additional capabilities provided by MMSP and the BMD 4.0.1 combat system.  The production lead time for AWS support equipment is thirteen (13) months, and deliveries begin in FY 2010. Under separate contracts, Lockheed Martin MS2 is concurrently designing the specification and configuration upgrades for MMSP, BMD 4.0.1, and AMOD equipment. Lockheed Martin MS2 is the prime contractor for both MMSP and BMD 4.0.1 development efforts under a contract with MDA (N00024-03-C-6110). Lockheed Martin MS2 also is the prime contractor for the AWS and is currently designing the modifications and configuration changes to the AMOD upgrade equipment under contract N00024-03-C-5115. Due to the complexity of the AWS, a contractor must have intimate knowledge of all system requirements, weapon specifications, equipment design, and interfaces in order to produce, field, and test production units initially, prior to validation of production designs. The government will not obtain a level III technical data package, sufficient to conduct a competitive procurement to meet the requirements of FYs 2009 through 2013, for MMSP, BMD 4.0.1, or AMOD upgrade equipment. Accordingly, NAVSEA intends to award a contract resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as Lockheed Martin MS2 is the only known source containing the requisite knowledge and the only firm capable of meeting the Navys technical requirements within the schedule for fielding AMOD capability.  Notice: See Note 22.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>PurposeThe Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is conducting a market survey of potential sources who may be interested in the development and manufacture of batteries and battery chargers for use on Naval Vessels. The resulting production units will need to be capable of being in production by 2011. This survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. The information provided will assist NSWCCD in understanding available battery and battery charger technologies. Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.

<DESC>Description: 
This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Washington Headquarters Services Acquisitions and Procurement Office (WHS/A&PO), on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Chief Information Officer (OSD/CIO).  Note that this is not a request for quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   This RFI seeks industry comments to assist the Government in (1) determining the availability of potential equal products (in terms of the functional and/or performance characteristics) based on the attached equipment list of commercial items.  WHS/A&PO welcomes comments on any potential warranty compliance or any required special protection for the attached list of equipment (e.g. installation, components, subassemblies, etc).  (2) determining when quantity discounts may apply when quantities of more than one [1] are ordered at a time (e.g., 10 each, 50 each).  (3) provide contract number and point of contact for current or past contract for similar services.  Critical elements of this RFI are product availability and warranty.  Small businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business under NAICS code (423430) with a size standard of 100 employees are encouraged to submit their capability packages.  Responses should specifically include (a) identification of the brand name (or equal) proposed, and (b) make or model number, (c) descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings that allow the Government a range of vision of the brand name (or equal) items. (d) provide a direct comparison chart of the features/functions of the brand name specified to any potential equal product.

RFI Guidelines: 
Please note that this synopsis is for INFORMATION and PLANNING purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor will the Government pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI. The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to enhance the success of any future procurement for these products.  Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information impliedly consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which WHS releases and disseminates the information for review. As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.
