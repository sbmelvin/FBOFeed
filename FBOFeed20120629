<p>The USDA, Forest Service, Olympic National Forest intends to acquire by contract the repair to re-establish support for a scoured pier on the Jefferson Creek Bridge on Forest Service Road (FSR) 2480. Channel scour has undermined the west footing of the Jefferson Creek Bridge on the Olympic National Forest, and the structure has settled 6 inches as a result of this loss of support. This requirement does not include jacking and resetting the structure to its original elevation and grade, nor any associated roadway work. This requirement is for a constructed repair that will support the structure in its current position and will mitigate additional scour at the west pier location.</p>
<p>The contract includes the following items of work:</p>
<p>1. Project scheduling to allow the Forest Service time to re-open the road to the worksite for construction access and to allow for scheduling of temporary re-closure of the road following the repair construction.</p>
<p>2. Maintain public road closure at the work site during construction using worker signing and maintaining Forest Service Type 3 closure barriers.</p>
<p>3. Quantify and document the extent of scour under the west pier through a diving inspection at the site, to be performed prior to or during the repair work. Provide "As-built" drawings of the specific repair work performed and the placement of materials.</p>
<p>4. Recommend riprap sizing and placement locations, as needed, to further protect the repair without obstructing the waterway opening.</p>
<p>Contractor shall construct the repair using permanent materials such as concrete and/or steel. Construction methods and measures for the repair 1) do not require de-watering of the worksite, 2) shall not allow any fresh concrete or grout to enter the stream, 3) minimize the disturbance to the stream, and 4) minimize the amount of time the work will be performed in-stream.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of the proposed repair method, incorporation of the above requirements, and the experience of the contractor to performing the method being proposed. A listing of previous projects and references will be required as part of the offerors proposal.</p>
<p>This project is located on the Hood Canal Ranger District of the Olympic National Forest: Section 7 Township 24 N, Range 3 W, W.M., near Hoodsport, Washington. It may be reached by traveling north from Hoodsport, Washington, on HWY 101 for approximately 13 miles to Forest Service Road (FSR) No. 25 (Hamma Hamma road). Proceed west on FSR 25 for approximately 6.5 miles to FSR 2480. Turn left on FSR 2480, cross Hamma Hamma Bridge, then proceed 1.5 miles to the Jefferson Creek Bridge. Jefferson Creek Bridge is a 3-span reinforced concrete frame bridge across Jefferson Creek. FSR 25 is a double-lane paved road for most of its length; road 2480 is a single-lane, aggregate surfaced road.</p>
<p>Period for performance is from July 30, 2012, to August 30, 2012, assuming the Notice to Proceed is issued by July 23, 2012.</p>
<p>Project Manager is Mr. Shannon Henriquez, 360-956-2264.</p>
<p>The Forest Service will proceed to issue a solicitation as a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about July 6, 2012. The Forest Service will award a time-and-materials contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and has been determined to be the best value to the Forest Service. Offers will be evaluated based upon: price; experience, past performance, managers &amp; subcontractors, price realism, and a Level of Confidence Assessment Rating (LOCAR).</p>
<p>Estimated Price Range: $50,000 to $100,000. <br /><br />Payment protection is required in the form of a payment bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or third party escrow agreement. Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to any resulting contract.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. The information requested by this Request for Information (RFI) will be used within MBDA to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. Government. MBDA is located in Washington, D.C., and seeks information concerning the availability of contractors capable of providing a consumer-off-the shelf (COTS) business plan development software to replace its existing business plan writer <br /><br />(http://www.mbda.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=login.main&amp;theme=business_plan_writer&amp;CFID=311218&amp;CFTOKEN=89593625).
<p>The proposed application should be scalable to meet MBDA's current needs and agile enough to support white labeling or a blended branding approach (e.g., "MBDA Business Plan Writer powered by ABC Company"). The desired application will be cloud-based and capable of being accessed from a remote location. MBDA is also interested in an application that is innovative and provides a value-added experience to the user. The desired application will also allow MBDA to generate usage reports and collect other metrics desired by the Agency. It is envisioned that any bid would be a firm-fixed price contract.</p>

This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology conducts all of the diagnostic anatomic pathology for all the patients entering and undergoing clinical trials in the NCI. The required microscope system will be used to generate a large amount of data that will form the basis for much of the research performed by the Systems Biology section in the NCI LP. The microscope system must meet or exceed the following specifications to satisfy the needs of the Systems Biology section of the NCI LP:
<p>1. Imaging capabilities:<br />A. The system must be an inverted microscope to enable growth of cells in living culture on the microscope stage.<br />B. The microscope must have a filter wheel capable of supporting six different filter sets.<br />C. The microscope should support multiple objective lenses, including 20x, 40x, and 60x magnification objectives.<br />D. The microscope must have a motorized XY stage, and support the imaging of multiple XY positions within the same experiment.<br />E. The stage must support various stage holders, including 96-well plate, 35-mm dish, and slide holders.<br />F. The microscope must have motorized Z control, and allow for Z stacking.<br />G. The system must be able to image multiple time points for each user-defined XYZ position.<br />H. The system must enable slide scanning capabilities.<br />I. The system must contain high-speed motorized control to enable several tens of positions, each with multiple wavelengths, to be imaged in less than 10 minutes.<br />J. The system must include a high quality EMCCD camera that supports 1x1 and 2x2 binning of images.<br />K. The system must support removable phase rings that allow for objectives with NAs of 1.40 - 1.49. <br />L. The objectives must be nano-crystal coated for low reflectivity.<br />M. The objectives must have high transmission from 400-1100 nm wavelengths.<br />N. The objectives must have chromatic aberration correction from 435-850nm.</p>
<p>2. Long-term time-lapse capabilities:<br />A. The system must have high-speed auto-focusing capable of maintaining stable, precise focus for multiple stage positions over several days.<br />B. The auto-focusing system must be embedded in the microscope nosepiece to provide optimal stability and compatibility with microscope upgrades.<br />C. The microscope stage must be enclosed within an environmental chamber that can support: <br />&bull; Constant temperature of 37 degrees Celsius;<br />&bull; 5% CO2 concentration;<br />&bull; and humidity between 30% and 80%<br />D. The system must be supported on a structure that negates ambient vibrations.</p>
<p>3. Software considerations:<br />A. All microscope components must be controlled by an automated software system.<br />B. All digital images must be saved in industry standard TIFF/JPEG formats.<br />C. The software must support user-defined macros or algorithms in addition to manufacturer supplied algorithms for image acquisition.<br />D. The software must have multiple image analysis capabilities, including: the determination of pixel intensities over subregions of time lapse image stacks and image Z-stacks, a wide spectrum of mathematical morphology functions (clean, erode, dilate, open, close, smooth), morphologic separation functions, linear morphology functions, fill functions (fill holes, close holes), skeleton functions (medial axis, skeletonize, pruning), binary inversion, convex hulling, contouring, homotopic marking, and zones of influence identification.</p>
<p>4. Expansion considerations:<br />A. The system must be expandable for a distance of up to 80mm between the microscope body and objectives to enable the addition of future hardware devices such as optical tweezers or extra illumination devices into the optical path without altering the main body of the microscope.<br />B. The system must be flexible to support new objectives and filter sets.<br />C. The system should have expansion ports to enable later upgrades for FRET imaging capabilities.</p>
<p>The Nikon Ti-E with Perfect Focus System (PFS) is the only known system that can provide the NCI LP the ability to perform long-term time-lapse imaging of living samples for up to several days. The PFS will provide a highly sensitive means to ensure accurate focus of selected imaging positions over these several days. This autofocusing system is of extreme importance for long-term imaging experiments, and the Nikon PFS is the fastest and most stable system on the market. The Ti-E system in cooperation with Nikon Elements software supports the acquisition of images over multiple wavelengths of light, with high-speed motorized control in the XY plane, as well as Z-stacking capabilities. The Ti-E system supports enclosure of the stage within an environmental chamber capable of maintaining proper tissue culture conditions during image acquisition. The Nikon Stratum structure on the Ti-E is the only system on the market with an 80-mm distance of expansion between the microscope body and the objectives, allowing a large distance of expansion to support future hardware upgrades without alteration of the main body of the microscope. Nikon is the only manufacturer of systems that enable removable phase rings for objectives with numerical apertures (NA) in the 1.40 - 1.49 range. The Nikon objectives are the only available objectives that meet all requirements outlined previously. The Nikon Elements is the most economical software package available on the market that meets all image acquisition and analysis requirements. The fact that this software package is provided by the same manufacturer as the hardware provides easier and more reliable control over experiments. Additionally, previous data important for the experiments conducted by the Systems Biology section were obtained through the use of Nikon Ti-E microscope systems. To maintain consistency and scientific accuracy with these data, future microscopy experiments in this section must be performed on a Nikon Ti-E set-up.</p>
<p>The Nikon Ti-E Microscope is the only known device to possess the unique characteristics essential to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology's ongoing clinical and research operations. Nikon Instruments is the manufacturer and distributor of the Nikon Ti-E Microscope and only known source.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Affymetrix, 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051 to procure the following:</p>
<p>1. Plate, Axiom Exome 1 96-Array, Item Number: 550396, Quantity: Twenty-Four (35) Box.<br />2. VAT/Duty Shipping Charges, Item Number: 000126, Quantity: One-Thousand Fifty-Six (1056) Each.<br />3. Services Charges, Item Number: 000126, Quantity: One-Thousand Fifty-Six (1056) Each.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), The Center for Research on Genetics and Global Heath (CRGGH) lab has ongoing large-scale genetic epidemiology studies of metabolic disorders including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, dyslipidemia in African Americans, Africans and Chinese. Over 8,000 DNA and other biological specimen have been collected, processed and stored on study participants. The goal of these projects is to identify the genetic and non-genetic contributors to several metabolic disorders with the ultimate goal of informing the health disparity observed in African Americans compared to their European counterparts. By developing genetic epidemiology models to investigate the complex interaction between genetic and lifestyle factors, the CRGGH lab hopes to shed light on the patho-biology of metabolic diseases in different human populations especially African Americans.</p>
<p>In this project, CRGGH is proposing to use the whole exome array which contains over 300,000 coding SNPs including non-synonymous and synonymous SNPs as well as variants in splice and stop codons. It also has about 30,000 single-base and complex indels from the draft Phase 1 1000 Genomes Project exome calls. All markers have low linkage disequilibrium (LD) and span both autosomes and chromosome X. The GWAS tags includes over 5,000 SNPs reported in the NHGRI Catalog of Published Associations (August 2011) and additional unpublished hits from scientific collaborations. Importantly, this chip can be customized to include about 100,000 SNPs from candidate genes that we are interested in directly interrogating in the lab. CRGGH projects in the USA, Africa and China were designed to identify susceptibility genes to several metabolic diseases in African and non-African ancestral populations with the ultimate goal of providing insights into the increased susceptibility seen in African Americans. Collectively, these large-scale genetic epidemiology projects in the US, Africa (Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya) and China have enrolled over 8,000 participants with carefully implemented informed consent procedures to facilitate the study of the genetic and non-genetic basis of metabolic diseases. Due to differences in socioeconomic factors including lifestyle characteristics (e.g., reduced calorie intake, higher level of physical activities and lower BMI), the incidence of T2D in the recruited African and Asian American populations are lower than in African Americans.</p>
<p>The Affymetrix Axiom Genotyping Exome Array, Axiom 2.0 Reagent Kit and the Affymetrix GeneTitan Instrument platform with Genotyping Console software is a unique and completely integrated microarray analysis solution for genomics research available solely from Affymetrix. The Axiom Exome Array contains approximately 319,000 unique markers and optionally 100,000 custom markers, providing the most comprehensive panel to screen for putative functional variants in the protein coding regions of the human genome.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC AIMS</strong>:<br /><br />1. Use the whole exome array chip developed and manufactured by the contractor to genotype 3,360 DNA samples.</p>
<p>2. Conduct whole-exome association study on several traits including obesity, T2D and related complications, blood pressure parameters (hypertension, systolic and diastolic BP), lipid parameters (HDL, LDL, triglycerides and total cholesterol) and kidney function parameters (eGFR, creatinine, and Albumin).</p>
<p>3. Perform a replication study of whole-exome association study findings in independent samples of African Americans, Africans, Chinese and European ancestry populations.</p>
<p>&bull; Replication studies allow for verification of novel findings and/or refining the position of previously discovered genetic variants associated with the metabolic traits of interest.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, the Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-58 (May 18, 2012).</p>

<DESC>Sole Source Synopsis Notice to FBO for $35 Million
<p><br />This notice is to announce the revision of the contract maximum ceiling amount on the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft System (MEUAS), and extend a previously awarded contract on a sole source basis. The MEUAS Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract H92222-09-D-0015 was competed and awarded to The Boeing Company on 28 April 2009.</p>
<p>Under the initial contract award, the contract maximum ceiling for the five year period was $250,000,000 with anticipated performance through 27 April 2014. During contract execution, emergingrequirements were validated for additional unmanned aircraft system (UAS) intelligence gathering, target surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) services using the MEUAS contract. With these additional requirements it became apparent the existing ceiling would be reached prior to the end of the five year contract ordering period. Program efforts were initiated in October 2010 to establish the competitive follow-on MEUAS II contract. A Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document to increase the existing contract ceiling by $50,000,000 for a revised contract maximum of $300,000,000 was approved on 10 June 2011 to allow for the continuation of mission essential operations during the source selection process of the MEUAS II follow-on requirement. The follow-on requirement was solicited under full and open competition pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15. The MEUAS II contract was competitively awarded on 2 March 2012 with a contract maximum of $600,000,000. This proposed contract action to increase the dollar ceiling of MEUAS contract H92222-09-D-0015 is to assure continuous operational capability during the transition from the MEUAS contract to the recently awarded MEUAS II contract. The MEUAS contract maximum will be increased by $35,000,000 for a revised contract maximum of $335,000,000.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, DDESS is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>Special education is governed by a federal law that requires students with significant disabilities to develop functional academic, motor, daily living, communication, and social skills while accessing the general education standards that are established for the school system. Our requirement is for an online, dynamic, standards-based curriculum specifically designed for special learners with significant disabilities. The curriculum should be developmentally and age appropriate providing a continuous scope and sequence from Preschool or Kindergarten to High School.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>DDESS requests vendors registered themselves as "interested vendors" if they are able to supply both categories of musical instruments.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>DDESS representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>6.0 Questions</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer's email address. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be answered by posting answers to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after July 6th, 2012 at 1:00 PM EST will be answered.</p>
<p>7.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide Special Education online curriculum resources for special learners with significant disabilities. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. DDESS has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>The FAA Eastern Acquisition Service Area, Boston Acquisition Office, has a new construction effort for projects withing the Runway Safety Area (RSA) at the Burlington International Airport, Burlington, Vermont.  The scope of work for these RSA projects includes the replacement of three (3) Medium Intensity Approach Light System (MALS) VEGA tower light assemblies with LIR frangible approach masts.  The MALS equipment must be made frangible to 3" with the installation of FAA approved frangible (fuse) bolts.
Runway 15/33 is the primary runway for this airport.  The outlined phases below are to be implemented to minimize the closure impacts to the runway and the Runway 33 ILS.  All work within the RSA is to be performed during night hours, tentatively set for 12:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. EDT, established by the Burlington International Airport Operations Center and Air Traffic.  A soft closure will be in effect, meaning that work within the RSA cannot commence until the last scheduled air carrier has actually landed.  The runway must be available for operations at the end of each night.  Lighted X's and low profile barricades must be placed at locations defined in the Construction Safety and Phasing Plan (CSPP).  The runway must be available for operations at the end of each night, therefore, the lighted X's and low profile barricades must be put in place at the beginning of each work night when work will be performed in the RSA and removed at the end of the work night so airport operations can resume at 5:00 a.m. EDT.  All trenches and/or excavations must be backfilled at the end of any work period or plated by an approved method.
These projects are outlined below, but are not limited to the following activities:
 Site preparation, including locating existing cables within the project area,  VEGA tower equipment removal and Low Impact Resistance (LIR) equipment assembly,  MALS distribution panel relocation, including trench and foundation work,  Removal, replacement of MALS system cables,  Proper disposal of unused equipment,  Retrofitting incoming power and control conduit to each Runway 33 PAPI Lamp Housing Assembly,  CAI and system acceptance. 

A site visit will be conducted on Tuesday, July 10, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  The meeting will be at the SSC Office, 1250 Airport Drive, South Burlington, VT.  The SSC office is located in the Base Building adjacent to the Airport Traffic Control Tower.  For security purposes, all attendees must contact Steve Finnerty at 603-881-1264 or via cell at 978-886-1264.  Attendees must have a Government issued ID.  RSVP by 2:00 p.m. EDT, Monday, July 9, 2012.

<RESPDATE>071512
<ARCHDATE>08142012
<CONTACT>Cecilia Todd, cecilia_todd@fws.gov
<DESC>This is an invitation for all Federal Agencies interested in an opportunity to join the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in an InterAgency Agreement.  Please see below for the details of this opportunity. 1. DESCRIPTION: The USFWS uses a science-based, adaptive framework for setting and achieving cross-program conservation objectives that strategically address the problems that fish, wildlife, and their habitats face now and into the future.  This framework, called Strategic Habitat Conservation, is based on the principles of adaptive management and uses population and habitat data, ecological models, and focused monitoring and assessment efforts to develop and implement strategies that result in measurable fish and wildlife population outcomes.  In addition, by leveraging resources and strategically targeting science to inform conservation decisions and actions, Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) have been established to create a network of partners working in unison to ensure the sustainability of land, water, wildlife and cultural resources. Agreements may be awarded for projects that address the priority theme areas identified in section IX of this announcement. The complicated and inter-related nature of climate change, land use change, invasive species, energy development, water withdrawals, and other stresses on our natural and cultural resources increasingly demand that resource management actions should be targeted, evaluated for effectiveness, and better informed by the growing body of science on climate change and its interaction with other landscape scale stresses.  Scientists and resource managers need to have new and more effective opportunities to collaborate, communicate, and develop scientific direction to inform resource management. The Department of the Interior has recognized this challenge and its obligation to work with partners to address the impacts that climate change and other landscape scale stressors are having on America=BFs natural and cultural resources by developing integrated adaptation and mitigation strategies. As a result, the Department, other federal agencies, states, non-governmental organizations and others have established 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC). The LCC=BFs are landscape-scale applied conservation science partnerships that will support and enhance on-the-ground conservation efforts by facilitating the production and dissemination of applied science for resource management decision makers.   LCCs may consist of Federal, State, Tribal, international, local, and private stakeholders.  LCCs will identify and seek to coordinate among existing relevant conservation partnerships, plans, agreements, and programs with the specific goals of identifying common needs for information and sharing information and science.   II. Award Information:  This program has no matching requirements.  However, to the extent possible, services in-kind and /or cash match is encouraged.  Project period of performance may be up to three years.  A determination of award instrument will be based on the level of involvement from other Federal Agencies. III. Basic Eligibility Requirement: Federal law mandates that all organizations must have a valid Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  IV. Application Requirements: Project Summary 	Briefly summarize the project, in one page or less.  Include the title of the project, geographic location, LCC Theme addressed by the proposal (see section IX, below), and a brief overview of the need for the project, goal(s), objectives, specific project activities, beneficiaries, and expected outcomes consistent with this opportunity.   As applicable, describe how your agency has coordinated with and involved other relevant organizations or individuals in planning the project, and detail if/how they will be involved in conducting project activities and/or disseminating project results. Project Narrative        [Maximum of 5 pages - not including curricula vitae for key personnel, literature cited, or the map or description of the project area.  Use a font size of no smaller than 11 points and margins of no less than 1-inch on all sides.] Identify the LCC sponsor(s) of the proposed project:  List the LCC name and individual LCC staff referenced as sponsor.  All projects submitted through this process must be sponsored by at least one LCC.  Note that some Themes (see section IX below) require a minimum of five LCCs as sponsors.  Sponsorship simply means that an LCC has been provided the opportunity to review the proposal and agrees that it will be of benefit to the LCC effort as defined in one of the thematic areas Project Goals and Objectives:  State the long-term goal(s) of the project.  Objectives are the specific steps to be taken to reach the stated goals.  State the objectives of the project, which must be specific, measurable, and realistic (attainable within the project=BFs proposed period of performance).  State the anticipated outcomes and/or benefits of the project VI. APPLICATION REVIEW Criteria: Recommendations for funding will be based on an evaluation of proposals against the following general criteria: =BF	Applicability and Relevancy to the Themes Described in Section IX (40%) =BF (Please be sure to review the Statement of Need, Desired Proposals, and Desired Results/Expected Benefits sections of the theme(s) your proposal is addressing) =BF	Soundness of Design / Technical Feasibility / Scientific Merit (25%) =BF Is there a clear statement of project objectives, explanation of what the project will accomplish and why it is important for the LCC Network=3F  Have the applicants demonstrated a clear understanding of the problem being addressed, the present state of knowledge in the field, and the project=BFs relation to other work=3F  Is there sufficient information to evaluate the project technically=3F What are the strengths and/or weaknesses of the technical design relative to securing productive results=3F  Is there an assessment of project uncertainties and how they could impact the success of the project=3F Have the applicants clearly described the form or manner in which the work=BFs products will be made available so as to be most readily used=3F =BF	Applicant Capability to Satisfactorily Complete Project (15%) - Does the proposal demonstrate that the applicant is capable of successfully completing the project, taking into account such factors as the applicant=BFs 1) past performance in successfully completing projects similar in size, scope and relevance to the proposed project, 2) organizational experience and plan for timely and successfully achieving the objectives of the project, 3) staff expertise/qualifications, staff knowledge, and resources or the ability to obtain them, to successfully achieve the objectives of the project, and 4) other factors as relevant. =BF	Timeline and Costs (15%) - Is there a clear table detailing appropriate timelines and associated measurable milestones, objectives, accomplishments, and deliverables that can be used to track and evaluate project performance through the entire award period=3F Is the time line realistic and has a high probability of being met=3F Is the justification and allocation of the budget, in terms of the work to be performed, unreasonably high or low=3F =BF	Matching Funds (5%):  Although match is not a requirements, projects with match will be provided additional points in scoring.

Funding Themes and supporting material Theme A - Synthesis Products to Advance National LCC Network Coordination and Function Statement of Need:  The LCC Network is in need of common sets of processes and tools to inform and support landscape-scale conservation planning, climate change adaptation, and effectiveness measurement.  Many such processes and tools exist, but determining which are best suited to the LCC enterprise requires familiarity with an extensive technical literature and communities of practice.  These may not be accessible to most LCC staff, precluding selection and adoption of the best options.  Acknowledging this, the LCC Network has to date funded syntheses and =BFbest practice=BF assessments for climate model downscaling and scenario planning.  Additional synthesis products may function to introduce the LCC network, and stakeholders, to unfamiliar but potentially useful techniques from a variety of disciplines, to assess the utility of existing tools under various circumstances, and to guide development of new methods in light of lessons learned or where no current ones are adequate to support LCC tasks. Desired Proposals:  Proposals addressing this theme will create a product that allows LCCs to select or adopt optimal products, processes, or techniques to accomplish LCC goals.  Proposals may include, but are not limited to, the following: =BF	Assessing and synthesizing approaches and products for biological planning, conservation design, and/or other LCC-relevant components of strategic large-scale conservation planning (i.e., those currently being used by LCCs and/or those exhibiting potential for this application); =BF	A comparison and decision guide for selecting landscape conservation planning software (e.g., Miradi) for LCC-relevant planning; =BF	A comparison and decision guide for selecting among alternative methods (e.g., scenario planning, projection, overlay) that account for the impacts of future change (e.g., invasive species, urbanization, climate change) and multiple resource perspectives (e.g., birds, fish, water quality) in identifying and prioritizing areas that are important for conservation. =BF	A survey and comparison of methods of measuring effectiveness of landscape-scale conservation actions. heme B  - Addressing Existing Needs Identified by National or Large-scale Conservation Efforts Statement of Need: The Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) recognizes that there are a number of existing conservation efforts that work nationally or at large regional scales.  These may include but are not limited to: =BF	National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP;  www.fishhabitat.org) =BF	Migratory Bird Joint Ventures (JV; http://www.fws.gov/birdhabitat/JointVentures/index.shtm ) =BF	Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation (http://www.parcplace.org/) =BF	National Phenology Network (NPN; http://www.usanpn.org/ ) =BF	Science and information needs identified in key national reports such as the State of the Birds Report (http://www.stateofthebirds.org/) =BF	Large existing regional conservation efforts that transcend multiple LCCs Many of these large-scale efforts have completed thorough assessments of the research and information needs that are limiting their conservation efforts or that would support enhanced efficiency of their conservation planning and implementation.  Because a fundamental premise of the LCCs is to build upon existing large-scale conservation efforts, the LCCs will support advancement of well-defined needs that are clearly LCC-relevant and will entertain proposals that reflects these needs. Note: In order to ensure and demonstrate the direct relevancy of the work to the LCC Network, submitted proposals under this theme must include statements of sponsorship by at least five LCCs.  Please see instructions and contact information on sponsorship in section C.2., above. Please note that the sponsorship requirement attests to a minimal level of relevance but the author(s) should also describe how the project is relevant to at least five LCCs. Theme C - Development of Performance Measures for Landscape Conservation and the LCCs Statement of Need: The Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) are highly collaborative partnerships involving a wide variety of federal and state agencies, non-governmental organizations, tribes and others.   The LCC=BFs vision is to develop conservation science and create a forum of conservation planning that will ensure that we have fully functional landscapes supporting our natural and cultural resources for future generations.  Each of the 22 individual LCCs and the national network of all LCCs are expected to document how they are contributing to accomplishing this vision both within individual LCCs, and as a complete network.  Congressional committee report language underscores this need, =BFThe conferees support these efforts but also expect the Service to establish clear goals, objectives and measurable outcomes for LCCs that can be used as benchmarks of success of the program=BF.  The Office of Management and Budget has similarly requested a more mature and appropriate set of performance measures for the LCCs.  Current LCC performance measures have been developed at several levels: At the level of the Department of Interior the following =BFPriority Goal=BF has been established (note that it applies more broadly than just to LCCs) =BF By September 30, 2013, for 50 percent of the Nation, the Department of the Interior will identify resources that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and implement coordinated adaptation response actions. Theme D - Enhancing Landscape Planning and Ensuring Compatible Landscape Planning across the National LCC Network Statement of Need A key function of LCCs is to integrate priorities across resource perspectives.  For example, at the level of the individual LCC, a key role is the development of common conservation goals and the development of tools and strategies to inform landscape-scale planning and management decisions.  At the scale of the National LCC Network, the goal is to provide a forum for national and international conservation planning, integrate the efforts of the 22 LCCs, and to facilitate efforts across and among individual LCCs.  Importantly, a role of an LCC partner is to define and share individual large-scale conservation priorities to help shape a common landscape-scale conservation framework for science and conservation actions.  This is all accomplished while fully respecting the individual authorities and responsibilities of the LCC partners and is intended to support their achievement of conservation goals that can only be attained through a landscape approach. However, designing a landscape that sustains the multitude of species, habitats, and processes that we value is a monumental organizational and technical challenge.  This needs to happen within an individual LCC but, critically, it must take place seamlessly across LCCs.  Currently, individual LCCs are exploring alternative means of overcoming these conservation planning challenges.  While this diversity of approaches is welcomed from the perspective of innovation, it also has the potential to undermine the ability of the LCCs to fully function as a seamless network.  Thus, there is an immediate need to develop explicit linkages among potentially divergent approaches now to ensure that there are not incompatibilities in terms of resolution, scope, or scale of the outputs later.  Conservation planning at large scales is not a new exercise. Large scale conservation has been addressed by organizations such as The Nature Conservancy through their ecoregional planning, in several large conservation efforts such as the Everglades, Crown of the Continent, and Chesapeake Bay, and through state-based exercises such as the State Wildlife Action Plans.  A situation of comparable challenge is being addressed by the Western Governors=BF Association Wildlife Council through the development of eight separate Crucial Habitat Assessment Tools (CHAT) that must have consistent definitions in order to be inter-operable. Theme E - LCC Network-wide Data Integration and Dissemination Statement of Need: Coordinated data management, development and delivery in support of landscape conservation efforts of the LCC partners are critical needs of the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives.  The National LCC Network identified data management as a priority theme to be addressed via a coordinated working group at the National LCC Meeting in April 2011.  Further, coordinated data management and delivery is identified as a key need in the Department of Interior=BFs guidance documents including =BFInterior=BFs Plan for a Coordinated Science-based Response to Climate Change Impacts on our Land, Water, and Wildlife Resources=BF (http://www.doi.gov/csc/upload/Detailed-LCC-and-CSC-Information.pdf).  Several LCCs have developed or are developing data management and integration platforms, yet there is sub-optimal coordination among various efforts.  Several LCCs have also identified development and updating of key national datasets as necessary to support their conservation efforts.  The need for coordination involves a comprehensive solution for data identification, discovery, acquisition, application, and delivery.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSAL AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This announcement is to serve as a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determine both an acquisition strategy and the availability and type of technology to issue of a Request for Proposal, including the potential use of any small business set-aside programs.  Whether the business is currently classified as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a) and/or Woman Owned Company, Hub Zone Small business, veteran owned small business, or service disabled veteran owned small business is irrelevant for the purpose of this announcement; the business must be able to meet the needs specified below. <br><br>SOURCE PURPOSE:  Employee Emergency Notification System.  This project's objective is to provide an emergency notification system for Government personnel during work performance in confined spaces, to include below-ground, cavernous areas.  The system must be a portable device that can be worn by the employee and be easily and simply activated as needed during an urgent or emergency event.  The system must be fully functional (i.e. include the associated hardware, software, transmitters, etc.)  so in the event of activation by the employee, emergency notification can be transmitted through various dam, Navigation Locks, Hydropower units, and levee structures, and also provide geographic notification of the employee's location.  The system must be capable of notifying multiple Corps and/or emergency response entities.  When the employee is working deep inside a dam or other structure with thick concrete walls, the system must still be able to make successful transmission, regardless of location on or within the structure (example:  spillway gallery located 200 vertical feet below bridge deck, walls 80 feet thick, routinely has 130 vertical feet of water on one side of dam). <br><br>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: The US Army Corps of Engineers covers several dams, levees, Navigation Locks, Hydropower units, and associated structures across the southern half of Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas.  Various offices within that area have personnel working as far as 150 miles away from their respective office at any time.  Radio Tower networks are available in some locations, but do not necessarily provide complete coverage.  Cell phone reception is not available in many locations and obviously provides no coverage inside thick concrete structures.  <br><br>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  Commercially-available (i.e., off the shelf) equipment and components comprising the notification system is desired.  Proprietary systems requiring custom made parts are not optimal but will be reviewed.  In the event of a false alarm, the notification system must allow both the employee with the portable device and the nearest local Corps of Engineer office to reset the system before local first responders are notified.  The system must be easily programmable and maintained by local Corps of Engineers office personnel.  The system must have the ability to contact multiple phone numbers and/or email accounts (either in sequence or simultaneous) and/or interface with current state and local emergency notification communication systems and have sufficient menu options for changing in/out contacts on a routine basis by local Corps of Engineers personnel.  Any equipment installed in the dams, Navigation Locks, Hydropower units, and levee structures must be wall or ceiling mounted.  Equipment installed inside the dam structures must not be allowed to protrude into the gallery hallways more than twelve inches and shall comply with National Electric Code and all other applicable Federal, State, and local standards.  Antennas mounted on the structure (in pre-approved locations) with appropriate lightning protection are permitted.  Use of existing Corps of Engineers radio towers is permitted.

<p>OUTLINE OF STUDY<br />Accommodation is measured while wearing USAF approved aircrew flight ensemble. Measurements will be made with a USG provided pool of subjects approximating the anthropometric population listed below:<br />Potential Anthropometric Cases (in inches)<br />Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6 Case 7<br />Thumb tip reach 27.0 27.6 33.9 29.7 35.6 36.0 26.1<br />Buttock-knee length 21.3 21.3 26.5 22.7 27.4 27.9 20.8<br />Knee-height sitting 18.7 19.1 23.3 20.6 24.7 24.8 18.1<br />Sitting height 32.8 35.5 34.9 38.5 40.0 38.0 31.0<br />Eye height sitting 28.0 30.7 30.2 33.4 35.0 32.9 26.8<br />Shoulder height sitting 20.6 22.7 22.6 25.2 26.9 25.0 19.5<br />Shoulder breadth range 14.7-18.1 16.4-20.6 16.2-21.2 16.8-21.7 16.9-22.6 16.8-22.5 14.2-18.0<br />Chest depth range 7.4-10.9 6.9-10.6 7.2-11.3 7.1-11.0 7.3-12.1 7.4-12.2 7.2-10.2<br />Thigh circumference range 18.5-25.0 17.1-25.0 20.2-27.6 17.6-26.3 18.6-29.2 19.1-29.7 17.8-25.2</p>
<p>The Government team will measure the following:<br />a. Reach to controls and displays, in several restraint conditions.<br />b. Reach, and clearance to achieve the full range of the rudders, throttles, brakes, and control stick. <br />c. Clearance with aircraft structures.<br />d. Ability to assume proper body posture before ejection.<br />f. Ability to perform movement for external visual checks (e.g., directly behind and above the aircraft).<br />g. Internal visual ability to see all instruments, displays, cautions, and warnings. <br />h. External vision over the aircraft nose/glareshield and side from the forward and aft cockpits. <br />Measurements are made with various sized and shaped subjects strapped into the cockpit. A coordinate measuring machine (FARO Arm) will be used to digitize and locate anatomical landmarks and surfaces relative to cockpit geometry throughout the adjustment range of the seat. These landmarks effectively represent subject posture and position in the cockpit with respect to the controls and cockpit structures. Geometric data will be extracted and analyzed that will be used to find minimum and maximum anthropometric dimensions related to mission required vision, reach to controls, and clearance from structures. This set of dimensions comprises the "accommodation envelope" for the cockpit. Differences in the dimensions of the seven potential requirement cases and the accommodation envelope of the cockpit will be calculated and included in the final report.</p>
<p>Respondents are reminded that participation in this market research is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated for any portion of this study.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Agilent Technologies, 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 811219, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI Laboratory is currently collecting DNA samples from Federal, Military and District of Columbia Convicted Offenders as outlined in the DNA Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the Justice For All Act of 2004. Recent passage of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 expands the scope of collection to include all Federal arrestees as well as non-US citizen detainees. In order to comply with this legislation and be able to process the exponential increase in samples being submitted to the FBI, the program has a need to acquire the Agilent Seal. The Robots used by the FBI are using the Agilent Plate Loc sealer to prevent evaporation during the processing of the samples as well as preventing contamination of the samples. The type of sealing material that is used is specific for the plates that FBI utilizes for the processing of samples, as well as being specific for the Agilent Plate Loc sealer located on the robots.</p>
<p>The seals requested are only sold and manufactured by Agilent Technologies. The seal made by Agilent Technologies is specifically made to fit the Agilent Plate Loc sealer that fits on all robots used by the FBI.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Agilent Technologies, as no other vendor is capable of providing the Agilent Seal that is needed for direct support of the FBI's mission.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 08:00 am, EST, by July 02, 2012, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<SOLNBR>F12PS00632
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract with Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Bronx, New York.  The Service requires the WCS to conduct a thorough review of the scientific literature and agency reports concerning waterbird/seabird entanglement in fishing nets.
The yellow-billed loon is an international species of concern, with the global population estimate at 16,650 to 21,000 birds, about 20-25 percent of which occur seasonally in Alaska.  In 2004, multiple U.S. and Russian organization petitioned the USFWS to list the yellow-billed loon as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  A thorough review of the scientific literature and agency reports concerning waterbird/seabird entanglement in fishing nets is the preliminary piece of a larger project planned by the USFWS and WSC.  The literature review is a part of an overall project the USFWS and WSC has and will continue if funding sources become available.  
Work description:
The WSC will first review the waterbird and seabird net-entanglement literature (scientific and agency reports where available) to identify 1) specific factors relate to net design, deployment, or fishery target that increase entanglements; 2) specific factors related to avian ecology that make birds most vulnerable to entanglement; and 3) compile a tool-box of approaches used elsewhere to mitigate bycatch.     This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. 

The Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) at Lebanon, PA intends to make a sole source award to Devicor Medical Products, Inc at 300 E Business Way Suite 500, Cincinnati, OH 45241-2384 (USA) for a Neoprobe Gamma Detection System (GDS) Control Unit with reusable probe.

The proposed contract action is for a Neoprobe GDS Control Unit with reusable probe for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) Soliciting from a single source authorized by FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1). For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotes. However all quotes received by the appointed due date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this quote based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:

The Neoprobe GDS control unit is used in surgical procedures known as lymphatic mapping or lymph node biopsy and parathyroidectomy. This is a minimally invasive technique to assess the potential spread of cancer and may spare patients the pain and complications of a complete lymph node dissection. 

Response to this notice must be received via email to stephen.soffer@va.gov by 13 July 2012, no later than 16:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Requests should be marked with Portable Probe Gamma Detection System.

The services include histopathological anaylsis services to include time course and mechanism of neuronal damage associated with chemical agent-induced seizures in rodents.  This serves as the Government's notice in intent to award a sole source, firm-fixed-price order to Brentwood Biomedical Research Institute, PO Box 25027, Los Angeles CA 90025.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no others will satisfy agency requirements.  This service is to support a research grant that was reviewed by a panel of expert scientific reviewers and was selected for award as an interagency agreement between the USAMRICD and BARDA. Two of the proposed tasks (tasks 7 and 8) on the grant were prepared by researchers at Brentwood Biomedical Research Institute (BBRI) who have over 10 years expertise in epilepsy research and in the identifying mechanisms of seizure-induced neuronal death in the immature brain. BBRI scientists have extensive experience and publications in the mechanisms of seizure-induced neuronal death in the immature brain, neuronal injury and in differentiating neuronal necrosis from neuronal apoptosis. The panel of reviewers specifically mentioned in their written evaluation of the grant, that the researchers at BBRI bring a "wealth of knowledge on seizure-based animal models, the study from an expert in juvenile/pregnant animal models".  BBRI is currently collaborating with the USAMRICD to evaluate the effects of organophosphates and chemical warfare agents in the adult rat brain.  For comparison between young and older animals, it is important to be able to compare studies using the same staining techniques and quantification methods, as well as interpretation of the effects, which can best be done if in the same laboratory using consistent methods, stains, staff, and software for quantification.  This is not a request for proposals and a solicitation will not be provided.  Any responses to this notice of intent can be emailed to Erin Maddox at erin.maddox@amedd.army.mil.  Telephone requests WILL NOT be honored.  All responses must be sent by 8:00 a.m. eastern standard time on 17 July 2012.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is procuring microrna sequencing services for the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) of Edgewood Maryland 21010.  This serves as the Government's notice of awrad a sole source to Array Star Incorporated, 9700 Great Seneca Highway, Rockville MD 20850 by citing FAR 6.302-1; One responsbile source and no others will satisfy the requirement.  USAMRICD has a requirement to identify potential therapeutics by microarray and microRNA studies.  Arraystar shall prepare samples for RNA isolation and perform microarray-based genomic, and microRNA analyses from frozen and paraffin sections, freshly frozen tissue blocks, plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid.  This is a follow-on requirement for commercially processed microarray analyses, which include microarray expression and microRNA sequencing of paraffin and frozen samples. This requirement is directly related to previous requirement that Arraystar had supported.   Arraystar has already gone through quality control testing with samples prepared by USAMRICD.  Other companies may have the ability to provide the service, but they first have to develop methods to produce the same quality of RNA to generate microarray and microRNA sequencing data and subjected to quality control testing.  Through support of the previous requirement, arraystar has the knowledge of producing high RNA quality to meet the Government's needs.   Additionally, in order to establish reproducible and comparable results, microarray and microRNA sequencing data must be produced from the same source.  The animal protocol evaluating the differential gene expression and microRNA biomarkers is already approved (Protocol U1001).  Since Arraystar has the experience of the USAMRICD samples are prepared, they can complete our studies in a timely manner and meet the first milestones. This is not a request for proposals and a solicitation will not be provided.  All responses to this notice can be sent to Erin Maddox at erin.maddox@amedda.army.mil.

Destination within Consignee=s Premises) to the USDA, ARS, Eastern Regional Research Center located in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania; in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications contained in this document. The Food Safety and Intervention Technologies (FSIT) Research Unit at the Eastern Regional Research Center requires a fermenting/drying cabinet. The system will be used in production of various dried/fermented meats that we will be experimenting with over the next five years. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 (current as of FAC 2005-58), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS is 333294. The Solicitation number is 102-0182-12, and is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ). SCHEDULE OF ITEMS - Furnish and deliver, F.O.B. Destination (shipping included) a fermenting/drying cabinet:
<p>Specification for Fermenting/Drying Cabinet</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />1. Constructed of stainless steel for durability and cleaning purposes<br />2. Precise uniform temperature control ranging from 2&#61616;C to 60&#61616;C<br />3. Precise uniform relative humidity control ranging from 20% to 98%<br />4. Dehumidifier function <br />5. Ventilation system with accurate air change for the fermentation/maturation of dried/cured meats<br />6. Chamber space: minimum of 60 cubic feet <br />7. Length sticks: minimum of 45 cm<br />8. Deionized/tap water compatible, no reverse osmosis (RO) water<br />9. Electrical supply: compatible with 208 V, triple or single phase<br />Many of the products to be produced using this cabinet are specialty ethnic meats that require very fine control over the experimental parameters required for proper fermentation to a target endpoint pH, adequate control of both temperature and relative humidity during post-fermentation heating or drying, so as to avoid untoward effects on product texture or quality such as greasing out, case hardening, and excessive or improper, or unwanted development of mold during ripening. This cabinet will be especially helpful for the production of pepperoni, hard salami, and Genoa salami since it will allow for precise control of time, temperature, air flow, and relative humidity while maintaining containment and control over the pathogens that will be purposefully inoculated onto/into such products.</p>

The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Identify areas for independent, professional evaluations regarding the prevention policing process and the justice sector of Guatemala. Design the scope of the evaluations and provide expert guidance to US embassy personnel in contracting for the evaluations.<br />f. Assist US embassy on issues related to citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law, with special focus on seeking out synergies and avoiding duplication within the US interagency.<br />g.

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES<br />DEBT MANAGEMENT SERVICES<br />1. OVERVIEW/BACKGROUND <br />As part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service, our mission as Debt Management Services (DMS) is to improve the quality of the federal government's financial management by increasing the collection of delinquent debt owed to the government, by providing debt management services to all federal agencies, and by protecting the financial interests of the American taxpayer. DMS also develops and implements government wide debt management policies.<br />The Financial Management Service (FMS) serves as the government's central debt collection agency, managing the government's non-tax delinquent debt portfolio. As a part of FMS, DMS' goal is to provide a broad range of services, to be more responsive to the needs of client agencies, and to bring about more equity and uniformity in how the U.S. Government treats its delinquent debtors. We provide these services through a network linking our own debt collection expertise and capabilities with those of the Federal Program Agencies' Debt Collection Center, private collection services, and the U.S. Department of Justice. <br />The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) provides that any non-tax debt or claim owed to the U.S. Government that is 180 days delinquent, with certain exceptions, will be referred to the Department of the Treasury for collection, which validates the existence of two primary methods of collecting debt: The Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and The Cross-Servicing Program. <br />Our call center collection agents provide both servicing that focuses on customer service to federal program agencies, and delinquent debtors. Cross-Servicing functions involve contacting debtors (phone and correspondence); negotiating repayment agreements; sending debts to Private Collection Agencies; reporting to credit bureaus; issuing Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) orders; and referring debts to the Department of Justice for litigation.<br />2. OBJECTIVE<br />Our objective is to incorporate the industry's current best practices and techniques. The facilitation should assist our 79 call center collection agents with techniques that build positive connections with debtors, provide an access to their financial information, and obtain effective payment promises that are within the guidelines of US consumer law such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), federal and state credit laws. <br />Our supervisors and leads, total of 12 are expected to gain the essential communication, leadership and coaching skills, and best tactics and practices for agent training and development, motivation and retention, team collaboration, performance measurement and management, and self-assessment. <br />The overall experience will provide facilitators the opportunity to deliver a curriculum that will provide agents empowerment and an extensive understanding of the direct financial impact experienced by debtors; a positive connection with people skills and negotiations; enhanced interpersonal skills, leadership, and problem-solving skills that are beneficial to all areas of life . <br />3. DESCRIPTION OF TRAINING COURSE <br />Call Center Collections Certification <br />This 3 day program should strive to improve debt resolution rates, agent productivity metrics, morale and turnover, and skills-based approaches that are supported by research and call center sciences; and <br />Supervision and Leadership Skills for Collection Call Center Supervisors <br />This 2 day certification program should be designed to provide the "how to" best practice for executing day-to-day, tactical job requirements with finesse. Supervisors and those in leadership roles will gain the core skills, knowledge, and in-class practice opportunities.<br />Contractor Requirements Necessary for the Contact Center Professional Training and Certification Program:<br />*Course Manuals<br />*On-line certification exam (to be administered upon course completion)<br />*Certificates of completion<br />*Certification awards<br />Contract Requirements Necessary for the Supervision and Leadership Skills for Contact Center Supervisors Training and Certification Program:<br />*Comprehensive course manual<br />*DISC communication styles assessment tools<br />*DISC implementation guide<br />*Cost per contact calculation worksheet<br />*Templates (SWOT analysis; Service Level Agreements (SLA); Operating Level Agreements (OLA); Agent Scorecard; Skill Needs Analysis; Phone Screening Interview; Behavioral Based Interviewing Questions; Skills Gap Analysis)<br />* Coaching Discussion Planner Tool<br />Contractor Facilitator Qualifications Necessary:<br />Contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry; possess a DUNS number; and be accredited by the Better Business Bureau. Contractor must have at least 15 years of service in providing contact center professional education.<br />Course facilitators must be certified at a "Master Trainer" level. Master Trainer level is defined as instructors who hold over 10 years of teaching experience and excellent attendee reviews. Trainers must be cross-disciplined in collections call center operations, hold real-world in the field experience, and most importantly be familiar with Federal government bodies and speak government fluently.

<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has a brand name requirement for NetScout nGenius InfiniStream Mastercare Maintenance. This is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) # SP4707-12-Q-0072. Place of performance is Battle Creek, Michigan. Inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at destination, Battle Creek, Michigan. Delivery shall be no later than 30 days after receipt of order (ARO). The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-58.<br />&nbsp;<br />This acquisition is totally set-aside for small business concerns and the associated NAICS code is 541511 with a SBA size standard of $25,000,000 in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities of more and/or&nbsp;less than requested or products other than those requested specifically by brand name will be&nbsp;rated technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>CLIN Descriptions:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: NetScout Mastercare Maintenance, nGenius InfiniStream, 4-Port 10/100/1000 Base, P/N: 6916A/TS SUPP MSTC, QTY: 02 EA. S/N: 4VHR5H1 &amp; 82QS5H1.</p>
<p>Redacted Brand Name Justification: DLA currently has two Infinistream network sniffers from NetScout, used daily to troubleshoot network, application, and software issues. The network sniffers help troubleshoot, isolate, and monitor network traffic. NetScout Maintenance provides all replacement parts, software modules, technical support, and software upgrades.</p>
<p>The current requirement is for support and maintenance on two NetScout Infinistream network sniffer units. With the required maintenance, DLA can have them repaired or upgraded in a timely manner. It is imperative that the requested maintenance be obtained directly from NetScout, or an approved NetScout partner so that DLA is assured of all the maintenance, software, upgrades, and technical support to keep our present compatibility with all the devices in production.</p>
<p>Utilizing another manufacturer's maintenance services significantly increases the risk of being provided incorrect equipment, non-compatible software, or invalid technical support, which could make the Government owned NetScout devices inoperable. NetScout is the only source capable of providing the technical support and critical updates for all software issues. Without name brand maintenance from the original equipment manufacturer, DLA will not have access to the latest software updates and releases.</p>
<p>Place "SP4707-12-Q-0072" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by Thursday, July 5, 2012 at 4:00 PM EST. Late questions shall not be answered. Quotes are due by the response deadline Monday, July 9, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST. Late quotes shall not be accepted and will not receive consideration for award. Please include your Cage Code with your quote. Questions and/or quotations may be submitted by e-mail to David Stemple, the primary point of contact for this announcement, at david.stemple@dla.mil.</p>

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) <br />(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements." <br />(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. <br />Other End Products:<br />Line Item No. Country of Origin <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />[List as necessary] <br />(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of Clause) <br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2012) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing amount quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. The evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br />At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

Proposal Submission Guidelines

The Offeror shall submit a proposal which responds to the RFP requirements, presents the Offerors capabilities, and is comprehensive enough to provide a substantive basis for evaluation by the Government. The Government will neither assume nor consider anything that is not specifically addressed; therefore, submissions should be sufficiently detailed to permit a complete and accurate evaluation.  

All proposal submissions shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one-inch margins (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial font.  Line spacing shall be set at no less than single space. Tables, drawings, charts, and header/footer information shall be 10 point Arial font or larger.  For tables, charts, and drawings, landscape orientation is permitted. Microsoft Office Professional 2000 or later shall be used to create the files (PDF files are also acceptable).

Pages that exceed the margin, font, line spacing, or total page limit will be deleted and will not be evaluated. Pages deleted due to violation of the margin, font, or line spacing restrictions will not count against the page limitation. Page count will not be based upon the number of pages printed but rather dictated by the number of pages in a print layout view in the application based upon the above-prescribed document settings. Counting pages in the order they appear for viewing will make up the page count. Page count limitations do not include drawings or illustrations which are essentially text free, nor will it include the Price volume or the Representation and Certifications.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Eng. Ahmad Thainat<br />Director General<br />Irbid District Electricity Company Ltd.<br />P.O. Box 46<br />Irbid 21110<br />Hashemite Kingdom Of Jordan<br />Phone: +962 79 518 1301<br />Fax: +962 2 720 1569<br />Email: <a href="mailto:athainat@ideco.com.jo">athainat@ideco.com.jo</a><br /><br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study (Study) for a smart grid upgrade to an electricity distribution company in Jordan.</p>
<p>The Study is intended to enable IDECO to improve operating efficiency, reduce losses, and cut costs through the use of smart grid technology. The Study is also designed to help IDECO modernize its electrical grid and incorporate advanced technology in order to deliver a more efficient and reliable electrical supply to its customers.</p>
<p>IDECO is one of three electricity networks in Jordan. The other two electricity distribution companies are also pursuing smart grid upgrades with support from USTDA. IDECO is a private company established in 1957, serving approximately 340,000 customers across 23,000 square kilometers. IDECO was privatized in 2007 and is now majority owned by Electricity Distribution Company (EDCO), which is in turn wholly owned by Kingdom Electricity Company, a subsidiary of Dubai Capital.</p>
<p>IDECO operates in the rural, sparsely populated northwest region of the country, and the primary consumers of the electricity they distribute are residential customers and water pumping facilities. Residential and commercial customers represent over 90% of IDECO's clients but consume only 60% of the electricity. Recently IDECO has experienced an extraordinary growth in electricity sales to residential consumers due to the increased use in home appliances and a national rural electrification project. The proposed project would allow IDECO more flexibility in setting tariffs for various consumption levels by installing a smart meter system in a phased approach, aiming at 15% smart meter penetration within the first three years.</p>
<p>The Study will assess the most appropriate technologies and design a smart metering implementation plan for IDECO's distribution network. As part of the Study, a new tariff structure would be developed that would allow energy savings for consumers and yield benefits for IDECO in the areas of: billing, metering and collection efficiency gains, improved customer service, and reduced energy theft. All available technologies would be reviewed in the context of IDECO's coverage area within Jordan. Areas to be directly assessed would include identifying the resources necessary for the system-wide smart metering implementation, including cost implications, availability of funding, and direct and indirect benefits of smart meter installations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $318,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The Grantee has agreed to a cash cost share of $35,400, or 10% of the total project cost. The Grantee Cost Share will be dispersed according to the Milestone Payment Schedule.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">12:00 PM, LOCAL TIME, on AUGUST 19, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 (current as of FAC 2001-24), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS is 11150.

This is a total small business set aside.
<p>Process:<br />Orders will be placed by USMARC personnel with the contractor by Noon on the day the price is set for that particular order. The price per bushel of corn will be based upon the Chicago Mercantile Exchange corn price listed at the website below at the time the order is placed with the Contractor. The price used will be the September 2012 board price. Once the September 2012 price is no longer available on the board the December 2012 price will be used. Once the December price is removed the contract will end. <br />The minimum single order quantity will be 5,000 bushel. The order quantity will be in 1,000 bushel increments. The maximum value of the corn ordered off this contract will be $150,000. The minimum value of the corn ordered off this contract will be $30,000. Corn deliveries will begin 1 week after the order is placed. All corn from the order must be delivered 1 week after deliveries begin. This can be waived or modified at the discretion of USMARC.

The total price of this particular order would be $29,100 ($5.82 * 5,000). Deliveries for this order would commence by July 17. Payment will be made within 30 days of the last load being delivered for the order or all invoices for the order are received. Multiple orders may be made off this contract.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />&emsp;<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluate Technical, Rank by Price, Assess Performance until Proposal rated "Substantial Confidence"</p>
<p>A. Technical Acceptability. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. The proposals shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>1. Subfactor - Certification/Licenses<br />The offeror will provide documentation substantiating their status as a Motorola Premier Service Partner and that technicians have Motorola certification on equipment and functions that make up the system to be supported and is certified to provide services in accordance with the standard of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The offeror will have at least one technician with ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Quantar Repeater certification/training. Other technicians will have Motorola certifications/training in one of the following courses, or comparable legacy certifications:<br /><br />(1) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Introduction to Radio System Management Applications<br />(2) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Radio System Administrator Workshop<br />(3) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Secure Communications Workshop<br />(4) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Telephone Interconnect<br />(5) Basic Trunking and ASTRO Concepts<br /><br />Newly hired technicians after award of contract or technicians without certification/training must acquire training within 12 month of contract award</p>
<p>2. Subfactor -- Staffing Plan<br />The Government will evaluate each plan to assure that it reflects a sound understanding of the contract staffing requirements. The offeror must fully describe how they intend to staff the shop to perform the work. The offeror must also demonstrate a capability to staff the shop in times of concurrent or simultaneous unscheduled maintenance events, multiple system outages and surge.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. Next, all technically acceptable offers (and "unacceptable" proposals that are correctable) shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule (See para C.1(a) of Addendum To 52.212-1, Proposal Preparation Instructions) by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each. Copies of the Pricing Schedule will be necessary in order to submit a proposal for each Option Year.</p>
<p>C. The contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government has in the offeror's ability to supply the Land Mobile Radio maintenance services that meet users' needs, based on the offeror's demonstrated record of performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table 5, Performance Confidence Assessments. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>D. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and the offeror is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>F. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>G. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>H. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br />(End of Clause Addendum)</p>

<p><strong>1. BACKGROUND - BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN</strong></p>
<p>Certain ground combat capabilities are an Airman's responsibility and require unique surface operations that are integral to the application of air and space power. To meet this responsibility, the Air Force recognized the need to organize, train, and equip a force of Battlefield Airmen (BA) capable of delivering distinctive expertise in a ground combat environment with unequaled firepower, accuracy, responsiveness, flexibility and persistence. These BA include Combat Control, Pararescue, Tactical Air Control and Battlefield Weather professionals. BA provide skill sets not commonly found across the Air Force and typically operate in combat zones outside the perimeter of Air Force bases, often in the deep battle space.</p>
<p>Each of these career fields has unique missions in support of both Special Operations Forces and conventional forces. However, many core disciplines are common to the majority of BA. These commonalities include areas such as methods of employment, mobility, force protection methods, communication, and advances in mission planning and rehearsal. Advancements are sought to support specific mission areas as they pertain to each individual career field. To better understand the needs of each BA expertise, a short summary of each career field's mission is provided below.<br />The Air Force Combat Controllers are Special Tactics ground operators who work as members of Air Force Special Tactics Teams and as members of Army Special Forces, Navy SEAL, and Joint Special Operations teams. Combat Controllers are certified to act as air traffic controllers and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers in hostile and dangerous environments. They can be deployed by sea, air, and land to take over or construct an airstrip, set up navigational equipment, and direct airplanes and helicopters to a safe landing without the use of a tower or elaborate communications system. They also establish drop zones and control parachute drops of personnel and equipment, and control airstrikes and air attacks from fixed and rotary-wing aircraft from all military services.</p>
<p>Pararescue Airmen, known as PJs, conduct conventional or unconventional rescue operations. These PJs are the ideal force for personnel recovery and combat search and rescue. PJs' primarily function as personnel recovery specialists with emergency medical capabilities in humanitarian and combat environments. They deploy in any available manner, to include air-land-sea tactics, into restricted environments to authenticate, extract, treat, stabilize and evacuate injured personnel, while acting in an enemy-evading recovery role. PJs participate in search and rescue, combat search and rescue, recovery support for NASA and conduct other operations as appropriate. They are among the most highly trained emergency trauma specialists in the U.S. military, maintaining emergency medical technician-paramedic qualification throughout their careers. With this medical and rescue expertise, along with their deployment capabilities, PJs are able to perform life-saving missions in the world's most remote areas. <br /><br />Battlefield and Special Operations Weathermen are meteorologists with advanced tactical training to operate in hostile or denied territory. They gather and interpret weather data, and provide intelligence from deployed locations while working primarily with Army (Battlefield Weather) and Special Operations (Special Operations Weather) forces. They collect localized weather information, assist mission planning, and generate accurate, mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of conventional and special operations. They deploy into restricted environments by air, land or sea to observe and analyze weather data. They also train joint force members to take and communicate limited weather observations. Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conduct special reconnaissance, collect upper air data, organize, establish and maintain weather data reporting networks, determine host nation meteorological capabilities and train foreign national forces. <br /><br />Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel advise U.S. Army conventional and special operations ground maneuver commanders on the integration and execution of air and space power. Qualified individuals, serving as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, provide final attack control to aircrew when aircraft are inbound to the target, ensuring the aircrew identifies and attacks the correct target, minimizing the risk to friendly ground forces and preventing unwanted collateral damage. Operating on the forward edge of the battle area and behind enemy lines, TACPs coordinate with Theater Air Ground System elements through the use of state-of-the-art communications, and maintain proficiency in the tactics, techniques and procedures of their aligned Army units. When deployed, the TACPs live under austere field conditions, and coordinate, de-conflict, and execute air-to-ground missions within the Army's area of operation.</p>
<p>To continue to maintain superiority over our enemies, research and development to improve the effectiveness of Battlefield Airmen is vital. The Air Force Research Laboratory seeks to address capability gaps, limitations or deficiencies through this Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p><strong>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA, that are selected for award, are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>Tactical Capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces white papers may also be submitted for the acquisition of test assets. In the event these submissions are selected for award, they could be awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2373, Acquisition for Experimental Test Purposes.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, AFRL/RW intends to contract with private industry, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions for research in tactical capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces (BA and SF). Research includes scientific study and experimentation directed at developing technologies, components, and quick reaction capabilities (QRC). This work includes tactical level Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), threat intercept, and force application capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces. Potential areas of interest include tactical level targeting applications such as wireless network applications, line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communication links, remote sensing, remote switching, target tagging, tactical command and control of ground forces, tactical electrical energy, small Unmanned Aerial Systems, and general improvements in situational awareness, targeting, force protection/fractricide prevention, and damage assessment Efforts proposed under this BAA should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort; however, there is the possibility of analysis efforts to support experimental testing or to support other demonstrations proposed under this BAA.</p>
<p>These basic and applied research effort results could include deliverables with provisions for future prototyping, field demonstrations and warfighter evaluation. Prototypes may be a deliverable but only as may be necessary to evaluate the basic or applied research efforts in a meaningful manner. Under some circumstances, we expect that narrowly focused white papers or proposals for advanced research may be required during the time of this open announcement. Under those circumstances, a specific or special BAA amendment may be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding available, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREAS</strong></p>
<p>The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the prospective research areas mentioned in the Program Description. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Technical Directorate focal points associated with these nine technology focus areas. Proposed efforts under this BAA must be in the realm of basic or applied research. Hardware development that is unrelated to a specific weapon system and not intended directly for the Air Force inventory may qualify if it falls into a category often called "breadboards/brassboards" or exploratory development models. Development of prototype hardware may be pursued under a BAA; however, such development must be for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of a technology or solution. It should not be for the purpose of acquiring specific hardware that has already been defined or developed by the Government.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - FORCE PROTECTION ENHANCEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of force protection to enhance the safety, survivability and capabilities of the deployed battlefield airman. The objective is to conduct research which could eventually lead to the development of improved shelters, materials, armor and related items for the deployed Battlefield Airmen. Research to effectively detect, deceive, avoid and prevent contamination and/or injury or exposure to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) and other threats will greatly enhance BA effectiveness. Research in areas that will allow the Battlefield Airmen to engage threats from greater standoff distances is also desired. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0069, 0070, 0071, 0119, 0153, 0272, 0393, 399 and 0409.

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<strong>RESEARCH AREA 2 - PERSONAL EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the area of personal equipment items to improve the capabilities and effectiveness of the battlefield airman. The objective is to conduct research which could eventually lead to the development of personal garments, body armor, eye protection and mission related personal items. Research in garments that will aid in camouflage, disguise, deception and concealment while preventing contamination and/or injury or exposure to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) threats may be proposed. In addition, research in the area of enhanced personal performance through improved nutrition, supplements and sustenance may also be proposed. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0070, 0071, 0072, 0119, 0142, 0351, 0359, 0375, 0376, 0393, and 0409.

<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for components and software in the areas of command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence in the mission planning, execution, and assessment stages of operation. The objective is to conduct research to improve training, planning, and rehearsal systems that function in a collaborative manner while fostering dramatic improvements in geospatial information systems, database access and information management. Research in fusing multiple sources of information including information in foreign languages, and adroitly cataloguing and classifying data across multiple levels of security classification may be proposed. Technical approaches to improve line of sight and over the horizon bandwidth for voice, video, data burst transmit and receive while maintaining low probabilities of intercept, detection, and exploitation may be proposed. Specific goals are to allow the operator to reduce carried weight and volume while adding long endurance, multi-net, multi-channel communications devices capable of operating in the full range of mission environments. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0001, 0006, 0042, 0044, 0046, 0066, 0074, 0081, 0095, 0176, 0186, 0198, 0203, 0206, 0210, 0211, 0219, 0225, 0238, 0240, 0241, 0249, 0270, 0292, 0354, 0356, 0379, 0404, 0411 and 0436.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 4 - OPTICS AND DISPLAYS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the area of handheld and wearable optics and displays. To improve the capabilities and effectiveness of the Battlefield Airmen, research areas proposed may include multi-spectral, day or night, color and fused capabilities. There is significant benefit in the ability to integrate on- and off-board system information through integrated symbology. The objective is to conduct research which could lead to the development of systems that will aid the dismounted Battlefield Airmen in their ability to detect, locate, georegister, designate, classify and assess targets in all environments. The ability to detect and identify through obscurants and camouflage while remaining undetected by enemy personnel is also desired. Reductions in volume and weight of equipment are key considerations. This research area addresses deficiencies 0127, 0157, 0361, 0375, 0405 0406 and 0409 from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List.

<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can provide improved clandestine, long-range ground and water mobility platforms that can be inserted via all SOF air assets. Current mobility platforms are becoming obsolete as new detection technologies make vehicle movement more observable than in the past. The objective is to conduct research that would lead to the modification of existing ground/water platforms or development of new ground/water platforms with reduced signatures (heat, acoustic, electromagnetic, and other emissions) capable of operating for extended durations/ranges. The focus should be on detection avoidance and solutions that reduce signatures to cloak SOF presence in the area of operations. These technologies must be rugged, lightweight, compact, waterproof, and operable in all light and weather conditions and must be comparable or better in performance (speed, capacity, armor, weapon integration, etc.) than current capabilities. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List: 0089, 0394, 0399, and 0415.

<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of medical equipment, remote diagnostics, prioritized casualty assessment, and patient/casualty extraction. The objective is to conduct research which could lead to development of synthetic blood replacement fluids, non-invasive administering techniques, improved pharmaceuticals, and bio-threat prophylaxis that address emerging and evolving biological threats. Research in the area of telemedicine to assess and intervene will greatly enhance patient survivability in austere environments. Applicable development areas and related systems should not interfere with tactical communications capabilities. Improvements in tactical medical equipment and portable diagnostic equipment that is smaller and lighter will reduce carried weight and volume. Systems that can be remotely manipulated will allow standoff treatment of contaminated personnel. Research on forensic collection, analysis, and databases will provide near real time assessment necessary for sensitive site exploitation operations. Research in improving patient extraction from austere locations and advancements in utilization of the CV-22 as an extraction platform may be addressed. . This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0096, 0134, 0175, 0268, 0269, 0270, 0271, 0272, 0357, 0362, 0414 and 0418.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TACTICAL METEOROLOGICAL SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can improve weather collection, communication and transmission systems and/or sensors. Technologies should be developed to collect, automatically and accurately measure, and securely transmit weather information (surface and upper atmosphere conditions) and Meteorological and Oceanograhic (METOC) data across the battlespace from any location and in any environment. Sensors should have the capability to be emplaced either remotely or by hand, turned on and off remotely, and should be small, lightweight, long endurance and when possible, include camouflage or deception capabilities to avoid detection. The capability to create a weather state depiction for use on common mission planning, mission rehearsal and operational C2 platforms with the capability to be automatically updated in real or near-real time is also desired. All systems and sensors should be standardized and networked to existing and future C2 systems so the data can be provided in real or near-real-time to staff commanders, operators, planners, weather forces, and global weather databases.

<p><strong>V. WHITE PAPER/ PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Criteria:</strong> The following five criteria, listed in descending order of importance, and an assessment of risk, will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested. <br /><br /><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /><br /></strong>a. An integrated assessment of the proposed approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, associated risks, and the potential contributions of the effort to meet/fulfill Battlefield Air Operations Kit (Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces) mission requirements. Potential value to the government (technical promise) will be assessed, based on innovation (originality and feasibility), transitionability, and desirability to the warfighter.<br /><br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.</p>
<p>d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror, if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).</p>
<p>e. The extent to which the proposal supports government field testing when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> Proposal risk for technical, cost, schedule, and other will be assessed as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers and proposals as privileged information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Those selected as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper or proposal (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should portions of a proposal be incorporated into a resulting contract, that portion may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act unless exempt from release.</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process:</strong> The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three Categories below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category I:</strong> Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong>2. Category II:</strong> Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>3. Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Office. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>B. Award Notices (full proposals):</strong> Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><strong>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), which may be accessed at the <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a>&nbsp;website, are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p><strong>D. Reporting:</strong> Contractors should expect any contract or assistance instrument resulting from this BAA would contain the requirement to provide various types of periodic and final technical reports, and possibly cost and other reports.</p>
<p><strong>E. Data Rights Assertions:</strong> It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The contractor shall identify data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc. that apply to any proprietary materials, technical data, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program; and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral toa resulting contract.

<p>Barbara G. Gehrs<br />Director of Contracting (AFRL/PK)<br />Phone: (937) 904-4407<br />Email: <a href="mailto:barbara.gehrs@wpafb.af.mil">barbara.gehrs@wpafb.af.mil</a> <br /><br /><br /><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>
<p><strong>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements:</strong> If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p><strong>G. Pre-Award Clearance</strong>: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p><strong>H. Excessive Pass-Through Charges:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br /><strong>I. Associate Contractor Agreements</strong>: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects.

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States and its citizens by providing effective foreign assistance and through fostering global cooperation. INL's Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere that produce and transit narcotics. INL/WHP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts by developing and revising drug and crime strategies and coordinating program development with other U.S. agencies.</p>
<p>INL/WHP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other U.S. government (USG) departments and agencies involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Treasury, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of the personal services contract is to provide a Prevention and Operations Advisor to the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, Guatemala.

The PNC of Guatemala consists of approximately 24,000 sworn officers and the Government of Guatemala (GOG) plans to increase their total number of officers to 34,000 over the next four years. The PNC is plagued with widespread corruption, their pay is low, and often times working conditions are less than adequate. Additionally, they are poorly trained and lack basic resources such as vehicles, radios, which makes it a very challenging environment to implement programs and teach new concepts.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities:<br />a. Provide strategic planning and process development on all phases of the prevention policing process from development through implementation; including planning, scheduling, and budgeting. Also, liaison with GOG officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the Police Reform Commissioner and USG agencies.</p>
<p>b. Serve as the NAS liaison to other USG agencies regarding prevention and operations matters.</p>
<p>c. Work with the Ministry of Government (MOG), Public Ministry (PM), Courts, and Police Reform Commissioner (PRC) to draft a philosophy statement and supporting objectives for uniformed officers of the PNC.</p>
<p>d. Coordinate the development and implementation of the program's philosophy and objectives with the PNC, PRC, international donors, and PNC Academy.</p>
<p>e. Create a clearly written operational and prevention plan in coordination with the PNC and PRC that is consistent with existing laws, regulations, and protocols which identifies the mission and objectives of the investigative strategies to meet the demands of Guatemala.</p>
<p>f. Coordinate with the PNC Academy in developing training for PNC personnel. Courses should be specifically designed for each supervisory level and officers assigned to prevention/operations as well as cadets. The courses should include techniques for developing prevention strategies using the programs philosophy and crime statistics.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.

Unless a contractor is present in Japan solely to perform under a contract with the United States for the sole benefit of the United States armed forces in Japan and is accorded privileges under SOFA Article XIV, it and its employees shall be subject to all the laws and regulations of Japan, including the US-Japan SOFA. Certain contractor employees and their dependents not accorded privileges under SOFA Article XIV may be accorded status under SOFA Article I(b) with potential eligibility for logistic support. Dependents of contractors or of contractor employees who receive SOFA Article XIV status do not receive SOFA status under SOFA Article XIV or SOFA Article I(b) based on their status as dependents. The Contractor shall comply with the instruction of the Contracting Officer concerning the entry of its employees, equipment, and supplies into Japan, and shall comply with all applicable Japanese laws and regulations as well United States Forces, Japan (USFJ) and USFJ component policies and regulations during the performance of this contract.<br /><br />SOFA CLAUSE 2<br /><br />SOFA ARTICLE XIV STATUS<br /><br />(a) Awardee may apply for Article XIV status under the United States - Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Offers shall be prepared based on the assumption that SOFA Article XIV status will be granted by Government in consultation with the Government of Japan. If the Government determines that Awardee does not qualify for SOFA Article XIV status or that SOFA Article XIV status is otherwise inappropriate, an equitable adjustment shall be made to the cost/price and other appropriate terms of the contract. Persons, including corporations organized under the laws of the United States, and their employees who are ordinarily resident in the United States and whose presence in Japan is solely for the purpose of executing contracts with the United States for the benefit of the United States armed forces may acquire privileged status under SOFA Article XIV. Such contractors and contractor employees are eligible for agency privileges and benefits under the SOFA but otherwise remain subject to the laws and regulations of Japan. Neither SOFA Article XIV nor SOFA Article I(b) status and privileges extend to dependents of SOFA Article XIV contractors or contractor employees.<br /><br />(b) Procedures.<br /><br />(1) Formal application for SOFA Article XIV status shall be made to HQ USFJ only after the contract has been awarded and the contractor's place of operation in Japan has been determined.<br /><br />(2) A contractor seeking SOFA Article XIV status for itself and its employees shall submit the following to the Contracting Officer as part of its offer:<br /><br />(i) Proof that the contractor is a person ordinarily resident in the United States or a corporation organized under the laws of the United States and that its presence in Japan is solely for the purpose of executing contracts with the United States for the benefit of the United States armed forces; and<br /><br />(ii) Proof that the contractor's employees are persons ordinarily resident in the United States and that their presence in Japan is solely for the purpose of performing work under contracts with the United States for the benefit of the United States armed forces.<br /><br />(3) The Contracting Officer shall make the initial determination whether the contractor qualifies for SOFA Article XIV status. Upon a determination of qualification, the Contracting Officer shall forward a request for designation through component channels to Commander, United States Forces, Japan, ATTN: USFJ/J5, Unit 5068, APO AP 96328. The request shall include the items requested in subparagraph (b)(2), a full explanation of the necessity of using a United States contractor, and relevant documentation. See USFJ Instruction 64-102 for further details.<br /><br />(4) HQ USFJ shall make the final determination on the contractor's SOFA Article XIV status upon consultation with the Government of Japan.<br /><br />(5) Upon receipt of HQ USFJ approval, the Contracting Officer shall issue Letters of Identification indicating SOFA Article XIV status has been granted to the contractor and contractor employees.<br /><br />(6) Once a contractor has been designated under SOFA Article XIV, it is not necessary that it be re-designated if a follow-on contract is awarded to that contractor; provided the new contract does not involve a material change from the work under which the SOFA Article XIV designation was originally granted and there is no significant delay between completion of the existing contract and initiation of performance under the follow-on contract.<br /><br />(c) SOFA Article XIV privileges and benefits. In accordance with SOFA Article XIV, paragraphs 3 through 8, upon certification by appropriate United States authorities as to their identity, such persons and their employees shall be accorded the following benefits of the SOFA. Note: Privileges and benefits afforded under SOFA Article XIV do not extend to dependents/family members.<br /><br />(1) Access to and movement between facilities and areas in use by the United States armed forces and between such facilities and areas and the ports or airports of Japan as provided for in SOFA Article V, paragraph 2;<br /><br />(2) Entry into Japan and exemption from Japanese laws and regulations on the registration and control of aliens as provided for in SOFA Article IX;<br /><br />(3) Exemption from customs duties and other such charges on furniture and household goods for private use imported by person when they first arrive to work in Japan, vehicles and parts imported for private use, and reasonable quantities of clothing and household goods for everyday private use which are mailed into Japan through United States military post offices as provided for in SOFA Article XI, paragraph 3;<br /><br />(4) If authorized by the installation commander or designee, the right to use Navy exchanges, post exchanges, base exchanges, commissaries, messes, social clubs, theaters, newspapers and other non-appropriated fund organizations regulated by United States military authorities as provided for in SOFA Article XV;<br /><br />(5) The transmission into or outside of Japan of United States dollar or dollar instruments realized as a result of contract performance as provided for in SOFA Article XIX, paragraph 2;<br /><br />(6) The use of postal facilities as provided for in SOFA Article XXI;<br /><br />(7) Exemption from the laws and regulations of Japan with respect to terms and conditions of employment except that such exemption shall not apply to the employment of local nationals in Japan;<br /><br />(8) Exemption from taxes and similar charges of Japan on depreciable assets except houses, held, used, or transferred for the execution of contracts referenced in subparagraph (a);<br /><br />(9) Exemption from taxation in Japan on the holding, use transfer by death, or transfer to person or agencies entitled to tax exemption under the SOFA, of movable property, tangible or intangible, the presence of which in Japan is due solely to the temporary presence of these persons in Japan, provided such exemption shall not apply to property held for the purpose of investment or the conduct of other business in Japan or to any intangible property registered in Japan.

<p>52.209-5 - Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Governments evaluation of quotations will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under 52.212-2 (b) of 1.) Technical Capability, 2.) Price. The evaluation of these factors will utilize an award basis that results in an award to the lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA) quotation. Quotes that do not meet the stated minimum technical specifications will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award. Finally, quotations that are incomplete and/or are determined to be priced unreasonably too high or too low, may not be selected for award. Therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification standpoint. Under the LPTA source selection process, trade-offs are not permitted, proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-price factors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical: The government will evaluate technical proposals and the below listed sub-factors on a pass/fail-basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, or unacceptable. An unacceptable rating for any of the below sub-factors will result in an unacceptable rating for this Technical Capability primary factor. Accordingly, under the LPTA source selection approach, vendors who receive an unacceptable rating for this factor will not be considered for award. Technical Acceptability shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>Technical ratings will be evaluated entailing a comparison of quoted specifications with relation to specifications of the government's requirements, and respective salient characteristics of each appliance type. If the associated specifications of any quoted item do not meet the Government's stated minimum specification, may result in a vendor's entire quotation being ineligible for award. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation, if the Government accepts any item, or group of items, of a quotation.</p>
<p>As a result of the government's evaluation of the aforementioned Technical Capability sub-factors of Transition Plans, Management Plans, Resources, and all associated elements accordingly, a determination of acceptable of unacceptable will be assigned using the following ratings and descriptions:</p>
<p><br />Technical Capability Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>ii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness and affordability, an initial screening of quotations will be performed to compare pricing to both Government and commercial web-based databases, and with comparison to the Government's estimate, and in relation to the product quoted. Quotations that are determined to be priced unreasonably, as either too high or too low, may not be selected for award.</p>
<p>(c) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award. Of those vendors found technically acceptable award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined reasonable and affordable.</p>
<p>**Quoted pricing, with comparison to the Government's estimated budget, that is determined either too high or too low, may result in such quotation not being considered for award.**</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the quotation, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the vendor's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quotation), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
<p>If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

  8. DESCRIPTION OF AMENDMENT (Continued):


The purpose of this amendment is to perform the following:


A.	Provide answers to technical questions that were submitted in response to the solicitation. The questions and corresponding answers are as follows:

1.	QUESTION:
Is there an incumbent?  If yes, please provide their name.

ANSWER:
No, there is no incumbent for this solicitation. 

2.	QUESTION:
Does the term day refer to a calendar day or business day?

ANSWER:
All instances and references to the term "day" in the solicitation are to mean "CALENDAR DAY". 

3.	QUESTION:
Can the VA please clarify Scope Work Item 4?  It is our understanding that ANSI does not accredit organizations. 

ANSWER:
The American National Standards Institute maintains a list of standardizations bodies that develop, maintain and withdraw American National Standards.  This list is available at the ANSI website (ansi.org) or by clicking here.  This requirement is consistent with standard Government practices and Department of Energy guidelines.   This accreditation is a technical evaluation factor (Please reference RFQ section E.7: Evaluation Criteria). 

4.	QUESTION:
The SOW states that the successful bidder must have received a Standards Development Accreditation by ANSI.  If a company is ANSI "certified", would that meet the evaluation criteria?

ANSWER:
Yes




5.	QUESTION:
Please verify that after receiving training a VAMC representative will conduct the initial assessment and the contractor shall verify the accuracy of this assessment?

ANSWER:
This is correct.  

6.	QUESTION:
Will all the initial assessments be completed within 28 days after receiving training?

ANSWER:
Yes

7.	QUESTION:
How long after the initial assessment must the contractor conduct the on-site evaluation?

ANSWER:
Contractor can perform on-site evaluation right after initial assessment completed.  However, site visit should be coordinated with the POC at the facility. 

8.	QUESTION:
The Guiding Principles are guidelines and not a pass/fail compliance standard. How do you propose these Principles be used to rate 100% compliance for your facilities? Is there a VA tool or will it be up to the consultant's opinion? Will you disagree with that professional opinion?

ANSWER:
The Guiding Principles are not "Guidelines".  Federal agencies had to select 15% of their buildings and make those sustainable in compliance with all the Guiding Principles.  The assessment tool is to be developed by the contractor (Reference RFQ Appendix A: Scope of Work). 

9.	QUESTION:
Will there be site visits required? Is so how many and for how long?

ANSWER:
The same type of field verifications for Guiding Principles certification are required with LEED or Green Globes.  Thus, the number of people and number of days would depend on capabilities of contractor staff. 






10.	QUESTION:
How will the sites be broken down? The GP are by building but the VA has this broken down by VISN. How many separate evaluations are required?

ANSWER:
The GP certifications are for buildings.  Evaluations will be done by buildings.   

11.	QUESTION:
How extensive are these evaluations? Are you requesting a summary of the site to outline how you got to the rating? Are you going to need support for conclusions? Are you going to want recommendations for improvements to meet GP? What about cost estimates? Drawings? Specifications? Narratives? Savings?

ANSWER:
The same type of field verifications are required with LEED or Green Globes.  Like LEED and Green Globes reports, contractors should verify VA's documents and conditions, provide reports and ratings, and provide recommendations for improvements to meet all GPs.  VA is not asking cost estimates, drawings, specifications, narratives or savings. 

12.	QUESTION:
The scope of work states that approximately 100 buildings at VA Facilities nationwide require certification for this contract.  What are the details for each building (location, square footage, special circumstances) that requires certification?

ANSWER:
VA will provide the details of the buildings to be certified after the close of the solicitation.  Please, assume all the buildings are between 5,000 to 100,000 square feet.  Travel will be paid separately.  Assume all the buildings are healthcare buildings.

13.	QUESTION:
Is a firm fixed-price required for this response? Please identify the evaluation factors - I do not see that terminology in the attachments. Lastly, are you requiring an SF330 as part of this response? 

ANSWER:
Yes, a Firm-Fixed Price is required (See RFQ E.1: Type of Contract).  The Evaluation Factors can be found in RFQ Section E.7: Evaluation Criteria.  An SF330 will not be required with quotes.  
	
B.	Extend the receipt date for proposals from 07-02-2012 @ 3:00 PM (EDT) to 07-06-2012 @ 3:00 PM (EDT). 

ALL OTHER SOLICITATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN THE SAME

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which Criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than Criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology which will include the layout, soundness and clarity of the technical plan, clearly outlined scope, metrics used to evaluate success and how it will improve upon current state-of-the-art technology developments, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Application &amp; Maturity of Approach - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness and how well it fits tactical audio, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees to the extent appropriate. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, DDESS is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>Special education is governed by a federal law that requires students with significant disabilities to develop functional academic, motor, daily living, communication, and social skills while accessing the general education standards that are established for the school system. Our requirement is for an online, dynamic, standards-based curriculum specifically designed for special learners with significant disabilities. The curriculum should be developmentally and age appropriate providing a continuous scope and sequence from Preschool or Kindergarten to High School.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>DDESS requests vendors registered themselves as "interested vendors" if they are able to supply this type of online educational resources.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>DDESS representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>6.0 Questions</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer's email address. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be answered by posting answers to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after July 6th, 2012 at 1:00 PM EST will be answered.</p>
<p>7.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide Special Education online curriculum resources for special learners with significant disabilities. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. DDESS has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Amendment: AG-3198-S-12-0036, SNAPQCS Support Services
<p>The responses to the original Sources Sought RFI notice were reviewed and assessed using criteria contained in the notice, which included an overall assessment of proposed solutions to meet the stated objectives and experience of respondents in supporting requirements similar in nature, scope and complexity to those envisioned for the re-compete of SNAPQCS. Based on responses received from the initial announcement, FNS determined that an acquisition strategy utilizing GSA Schedule 70 is best suited to support the SNAPQCS project. FNS will continue to receive responses to the Sources Sought RFI Notice until July 6 from qualified small businesses that possess a GSA Schedule 70 contract. As a result of the government's overall assessment, RFI respondents will receive formal notification of their viability or non-viability. <br />FNS may release a draft RFQ to the pool of viable vendors to obtain questions from them that may help clarify the requirements; the Government may conduct due diligence with viable vendors to ensure the Statement of Objectives (SOO) meets Industry best practices and clarifies/addresses issues raised by the viable vendors to the extent possible in the final RFQ, when released. <br /><br />A final RFQ will be released to the pool of viable vendors; however, non-viable respondents are not precluded from responding to the resultant solicitation. This strategy is in compliance with FAR 8.405-2(c)(3)(iii)(B) "to provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least 3 contractors that can fulfill the requirements."</p>
<p>This notice is for information purposes only, therefore, vendors are not required to respond and the government is not able to answer any vendor questions at this stage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall objective of this effort is to develop and document repeatable vehicle level performance test procedures to assess the single and combined effects of fire attenuation (i.e., hardening), detection, and suppression in motorcoaches, and demonstrate the efficacy of these procedures to assess current and future fire safety technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tests and criteria may be used by NHTSA to objectively measure and compare safety performance of vehicles equipped with the fire mitigation technologies to unequipped vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tests should be developed at the vehicle level when possible and component level when necessary, with detailed documentation to support this distinction.</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">The Contractor shall furnish the necessary qualified personnel, facilities, materials, supplies, and equipment to develop test procedures to assess fire detection and suppression systems, and research to develop flammability requirements for exterior materials for motor coaches may also be proposed as an option under this contract.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contract will have a total possible performance period of five (5) years each. This includes a base period of one (1) year with four one (1) year option periods.</p>

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) is located in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Center is responsible for research on federally managed marine fisheries, protected species such as the endangered Hawaiian monk seal and other marine mammals, and ecosystems in the entire western and central Pacific Ocean, including coral reefs, insular (near island) habitats and pelagic (open ocean) environments. <br />.<br />REQUIREMENT: The contractor shall provide a vessel that can support a variety of scientific and management activities, including but not limited to, protected species field camp deployment and recovery, marine debris recovery operations, cetacean surveys, scientific research, and emergency response. Field camp support includes transporting personnel, supplies and scientific materials to remote locations and transferring them on and off the island via small boat. It may be required to transport monk seals between islands. Marine debris recovery includes locating and removing derelict fishing gear and other marine debris; requiring extensive diving, snorkeling and free-diving operations from small boats launched from a larger research vessel platform and requires storage and transport of the debris onboard the vessel until it can be transferred ashore for proper disposal. Cetacean surveys may include continuous visual surveys during daylight hours for cetaceans using mounted binoculars. Scientific activities may include support of small boat and diving operations near remote islands or the deployment and recovery of scientific instrumentation in the open ocean. Emergency response may include the evacuation of personnel and/or animals from remote field stations in the event of a medical emergency or natural disaster.<br />Vessel Requirements: <br />1. The vessel operator/owner shall obtain a permit allowing operations within the Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument (PMNM). The vessel's permit shall cover all activities related to vessel operations including but not limited to navigation, access to the PMNM, overboard discharge, anchoring, prohibited fishing, and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). The PMNM may be contacted for a full description of vessel permitting requirements. A separate Scientific and/or Resource Management type of permit which will cover the Government's personnel and operations will be obtained by the Government.
<p>2. The vessel shall provide a USCG Certificate of Inspection (COI) that is valid for the time period of the charter. Any costs associated with bringing the vessel to a passing standard are the responsibility of the contractor. A copy of the USCG certification shall be posted on the vessel and a copy shall be provided as part of the proposal. If an award is made and the contractor subsequently fails to obtain a COI before the start of the charter, this contract may be terminated. Furthermore, in the event of such termination, the contractor may be liable to the Government for costs associated with re-procurement.</p>
<p>3. The vessel shall be at least 100 feet Length Overall (LOA), 120 feet Length Overall is desired but not required.</p>
<p>4. The vessel shall be able to maintain a minimum cruising speed of 8 knots in a Beaufort sea state 6 (sustained winds of 21 to 26 knots with 9 to 13 feet seas). The ability to maintain a minimum cruising speed of 10 knots in a Beaufort sea state 6 is desired, but not required.</p>
<p>5. The vessel shall have sufficient fuel capacity and reserves to accommodate 60 days of continuous operations. Fuel consumption estimates can be based on 50% of the time transiting between locations and 50% of the time on-station with all housekeeping, deck, electrical, and other necessary services available.</p>
<p>6. The vessel shall have sufficient endurance to depart Honolulu, conduct a minimum of 35 days of operations at sites as far away as Kure Atoll, and safely return to Honolulu. Should work be required at more remote locations (e.g. Palmyra or Wake Atolls) the Government will consult with the contractor to determine the number of days that operations can be safely conducted.</p>
<p>7. The proposal shall provide specifications for fuel capacity and fuel consumption rates for the vessel underway at 8 knots. These will be used as a factor in evaluating responses to the solicitation to assess the vessel's endurance and the estimated cost of fuel for a given charter operation. This should not be taken as a desire on Government's part to constrain the vessel's speed to 8 knots. The vessel's captain is expected to work with the Government to determine the most effective and efficient safe speed for vessel operation and fuel costs will be reimbursed based on actual expenses.</p>
<p>8. The vessel shall be equipped with the appropriate compliment of tools and spare parts necessary to maintain general vessel operations for the duration of the charter.</p>
<p>9. Two (2) electrical power outlets (120 VAC, 60 Hz) near on-deck work areas are required. Additional outlets are desired, but not required.</p>

Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site Mid to late-May 2012. No paper copies will be mailed.

Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in both locations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to Michael Henderson at HendersonMP@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C.

<DESC>Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00065 was awarded on a sole source basis to Systems Research and Applications Corporation (SRA) for six (6) months of research and development (R&amp;D) support services specifically to provide support to the DHS/Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Checked Baggage program for the testing of technologies and capabilities that will provide improved security and reduced operational cost for checked baggage screening. As technologies proceed through the R&amp;D phases, specialized technical support is required to assist TSL in the development of the appropriate evaluation techniques and tools, as well as the conduct of certification readiness testing (CRT) and evaluation of systems. <br /><br />The work being performed includes developing standardized CRT bag sets, including threat containers and concealments; archiving vendor and CRT images on file servers and back-up storage drives; verifying that all images can be replayed on EDS emulators; scoring CRT images for threat detection and false alarms; conducting data reduction and analyses; and reporting the results in vendor briefings.
<p>Additionally, the work provides a level of on-call responsiveness in the event of a national emergency. Therefore, this requested action to continue support to critical R&amp;D laboratory operations and support tasks will ensure continuity of specialized technical and laboratory expertise, pending award of a follow-on acquisition based on a new solicitation.</p>
<p>The Limited Source Justification (LSJ) and Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (J&amp;A) are attached to this notice.</p>

<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. It is executed on behalf of 174 LRS.</p>
<p>2. The 174 FW proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition Vindicator VCC Upgrade. Another company working and installing components to the Head End System will compromise the systems integrity and warranty.</p>
<p>3. The purchase is at a cost of $52,033<br /><br />4. Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>a. FAR 6.302-1, only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government</p>
<p>b. 10 USC 2304(c)(2)</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a purchase order to obtain Vindicator VCC Upgrade BDOC and Alternate BDOC . The statutory authority cited is FAR 6.302-1, Only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government, is necessary as delay in award of this contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the government. This is for Vindicator Security System Upgrades. Vindicator has installed this system and maintains a warranty on these parts. Vindicator also installed the Head End System for the base. If we were to allow another company to add components or work on the Vindicator system we would not only compromise the integrity of the system but we would void the warranty on the existing system. All prices are deemed fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
 
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition and Logistics
      Technology Acquisition Center
      260 Industrial Way West
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
        
2.	Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm fixed-price (FFP) Delivery Order (DO) issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), for renewal of annual support and maintenance for exisiting Symantec Netbackup licenses used by the Repositories program Health Data Repository (HDR) project.  The period of performance for this DO will be a twelve month base period.  
  
3.	Description of Supplies or Services: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Salt Lake City Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) has a requirement for renewal of annual support and maintenance for existing Symantec Netbackup licenses used by the Repositories program Health Data Repository (HDR) project. The Repositories Program supports integrated, computable, and viewable access to the patient's longitudinal health record.   HDR enables providers to obtain integrated data views and acquire the patient-specific clinical information needed to support treatment decisions.  HDR resides on one national platform for use by clinicians and other personnel in support of Veteran-centric care and provides a national, longitudinal data base of Veteran's clinical data that is structured, standardized and used by clinical and analytic applications.  HDR provides information that is used in clinical decision-making and therefore requires proper functionality and the latest upgrades in the software products and service agreements it uses in order to meet its objective of supporting clinical decision-making.  HDR has been designated a high availability system, with up time of 95% or greater and requires that any software maintenance and support be available twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, and three hundred sixty-five (365) days a year (24x7x365) for phone support, patches, bug fixes, and updates.  HDR utilizes Symantec NetBackup for all the backup functionality and for all test and development systems located in the Salt Lake City Office Information Field Office (OIFO).  Subject procurement requests the renewal of the annual support and maintenance agreement for the existing Symantec NetBackup software.

The total estimated price of the proposed action is 

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 253j(b) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."  

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  HDR purchased backup and storage software and service several years ago.  The original award was made to NetBackup.  The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is Symantec.  The Symantec NetBackup software and access to the service and maintenance agreement is licensed, not sold.  The supplies/services are unique or highly specialized because Symantec retains all rights, titles and interest in the software and service, including all intellectual property rights.  Under the terms of the product licensing agreement, users may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, make any attempt to discover the source code of the software or create derivative works from the software or service (source:  Product Licensing Agreement, Section 6, Scope of License).  Service subscribers receive new features to the software and service as the vendor, Symantec, makes such features available during the current service period.  Symantec continually strives to improve the usability and performance of its products and services and reserves the right, at its discretion and without notice, to add, modify or remove features from the software or service at any time.  Users may be required to upgrade to the latest version of the software in order for the service to continue to function correctly (source:  Product Licensing Agreement, Section 8, Changes to the Service).  Based on the terms of the product licensing agreement, the annual service agreement is limited to only Symantec or an authorized reseller.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  Limited competition is anticipated for the aforementioned brand name item or service.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.3, the contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Page.  In addition, this Justification and Approval (J&A) will be made publicly available on the FBO Page.

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name, there are thirty-five (35) authorized resellers of these products on the NASA SEWP IV contract.  Competition for this requirement among these vendors is anticipated. Any proposals received will be evaluated.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.3, the contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Page. In order to remove barrier to competition for future acquisitions, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research to consider alternate software solutions.  

8.	Market Research: Market Research was conducted in September 2011 to confirm whether the OEM owns or licenses the required software and services.  Since Symantec states in its Product Licensing Agreement that it owns all of the  software and code, only Symantec or an authorized reseller of the product can provide the service being requested. No other brand will meet the Government's requirements.   Further Market Research was conducted February 27, 2012 utilizing the NASA SEWP IV Product Verification and Manufacturer Lookup tool and it was determined that there are thirty-five (35) vendors offering Symantec software maintenance product lines as follows: six (6) value added resellers (VARs) and computer system original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), seven (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs), twelve (12) small business set-aside VARs, and ten (10) VARs.  As a result, the research determined there is adequate competition among the resellers.  Per the terms of the NASA SEWP IV contract, requirements for brand name specific equipment should be solicited to all four (4) contract groups (A, B, C and D) in order to fully notify all interested parties. However, since there is adequate competition among small businesses, quotes will only be accepted from Groups B (service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses) and C (small businesses).  

9.   Other Facts:  The required annual maintenance for the Symantec software was previously purchased under NASA SEWP IV order number VA118-11-F-0464 on September 23, 2011.

<DESC>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED
<p>This is a modification to extend the existing contract, FA9200-06-C-0024, a Cost Reimbursable Contract for JMEMs. The contractor is Oklahoma State University Center for Innovation and Economic Development, 107 Wes Watkins Center, Stillwater, OK 74078-1020. The terms of the contract will be extended for a total period of 45 days. This effort will use incremental funding not to exceed $1M.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Under this contemplated extension Oklahoma State University (OSU) will provide research and development for JMEMs as described below:</p>
<p>(1) JMEMs development. The contractor is engaged in the constant process of expanding the breadth and depth of capabilities of JMEMs in order to meet the rapidly evolving needs of the warfighter. The development aspect of the work to be preformed the work is highly specialized with only a small niche community able to perform the complex task of developing advanced weaponeering models and predictive tools. The development of these models and tools are based upon both future needs and current needs of DoD's weaponeers working to prosecute targets in the AOR. This development is executed through research and development of methodologies to predict weapon effectiveness and incorporation of statistical data from weapon test in to these methodologies resulting in accurate predictions of outcomes. However, development of the methodologies is only one portion of the improving of the capabilities of JMEMs, the other portion is the development of the software to allow end users to utilize the tools and methodologies and apply them to real world situations. This encompasses the entire spectrum of software development from requirements analysis to deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p>(2) JMEMs software maintenance. As software based analytical tool JMEMs requires regular maintenance to as does any other software. This maintenance also provides enhancements to existing software versions and provides a basis for upgrades to be incorporated in to future versions.</p>
<p>(3) JMEMs Training. Training is an important part of the contractors' activity. The contractor shall generate instructional material to educate and indoctrinate users of JMEM publications. The materials include but are not limited to interactive wizards and checklist on the products and formal course materials. OSU provides personnel resources as instructors for onsite training to users at both CONUS and OCONUS locations. OSU is responsible for maintaining and transporting training equipment and material to CONUS and OCONUS locations for training.</p>
<p>The extension period will be 1 July 2012 - 15 August 2012. Funding for this effort will be 3600 or other R&amp;D funding as direct cited from an OSD MIPR.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Statutory authority is 10 U. S. C. 230(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2. Unusual and compelling urgency.</p>
<p><br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Currently the JMEMs effort is in source selection and upon award, it will be a 5 year effort. An aggressive timeline was constructed to determine the length of time required to conduct a full and open competition for the requirements of this extension at the estimated dollar threshold of $50M, and subsequently triggered a Multi-Functional Independent Review Team (MIRT) to impede the source selection processing timeline. The current contract will expire on 30 June 2012.</p>
<p>Given the need date of 01 July 2012, conducting a competitive source selection for this effort would cause a minimum gap in performance of 45 days, included is the government's estimate of 60 days for phase-in. The 60 day phase-in is required to transition into a new contract, obtaining all of the resources, security clearances and transfer of classified information, and base-specific knowledge it takes to provide consistently smooth, quality service. JTCG/ME will not be able to sustain current projects without this extension of this contract. In this day of continuous and lengthy deployments of our military members, it is of the utmost importance to provide them with good, consistent uninterrupted service to protect their lives while in combat. <br /><br />Specific activities that will need to be postponed and cannot be completed and fielded if JMEMs contract were to lapse:<br /><br />JWS 2.1 was released the week of 12 December 2011. Since the release, operational users have identified areas requiring improvements and fixes. The fixes address urgent COCOM concerns when weaponeering against hardened targets. It is imperative that the government not allow a disruption in the current contract that will adversely affect the mission of the COCOMs. Over the next contract extension, the contractor will accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Support the COCOM's concerns and resolve issues pertaining to JWS 2.1. The expert support from the contractor is crucial and must be accurate, effective and timely.</p>
<p>2. Complete the DIACAP documents in process for Approval to Operate (ATO) JWS 2.1, J-ACE 5.0 and J-ACE 5.1 on Joint Service systems throughout the DoD.</p>
<p>3. Provide JWS 2.1 instructor training to operational users. This training is a critical follow-on to the development of the tool. This training is essential in support of COCOMs in the AORs and to the warfighter.</p>
<p>4. Support Operational Users' Working Group meetings to identify and correct problems with the current version, generate new requirements to improve the next JWS release.</p>
<p>5. Complete JWS documentation needed in the development of the next JWS release.</p>
<p>Extending this period of performance will avoid unacceptable delays in fixing problems identified with the release of JWS 2.1. JWS and J-ACE are JMEMs tools used by the warfighter throughout the DoD. The JMEMs tools are critical resources that must be continuously upgraded to support the COCOMS in the AORs. If the period of performance is not extended, the warfighter's capabilities are limited, risk to the warfighter is increased and the COCOM targeting cells will be negatively impacted.</p>
