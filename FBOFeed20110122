<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (Soldier, Chemical, Research & Test), RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is issuing a FINAL Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-11-R-0002, for the establishment of a Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) for MultiScale multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic materials (MSME).  <BR><BR>The purpose of this MSME CRA PA is to solicit offers that will help fulfill the research and development goals of the U.S. Department of the Army.  The Army envisions the Alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to undertake the fundamental research necessary to enable the quantitative understanding of electronic materials from the smallest to the largest relevant scales. Resulting models are needed to create new understanding and improved electronic device applications to include sensors and electronics for enhanced battlespace effects, and efficient power and energy devices. The objective of this Alliance is to conduct fundamental research to create MSME to support development of future electronic materials and devices for the Army.  To achieve this, the Alliance is expected to advance the fundamental science, understanding, and state-of-the-art (SoA) for Multiscale Multidisciplinary Models in each of the following Electronic Materials Research Areas:  1) Electrochemical Energy Devices, 2) Hybrid Photonic, Spintronic Devices, and 3) Heterogeneous Metamorphic Electronics. The intent is for the Multiscale Models to be developed by the MSME Team.  The experimentation for validation and verification for these models will be performed by ARL scientists in each of the three Electronic Materials Research Areas, which is expected to be part of a continual process to improve and create new models through collaboration between ARL and MSME Team. Programmatically, the CRA should initiate and execute a fundamental, cohesive, multidisciplinary collaborative research program that links MSME across length and time scales with validated modeling.   Responses to the PA are expected to provide a plan to perform materials by design by addressing the following Multiscale Modeling Research Core elements for each of the Electronic Materials Research Areas above: 1) Modeling and Simulation, 2) Bridging the Scales, 3) Multiscale Material Metrics, 4) Validation and Verification, and 5) Processing and Synthesis.   Innovative crosscutting themes across both the Electronic Materials Research Areas and Multiscale Modeling Research Core Elements are envisioned to advance the SoA as part of this initiative.  <BR><BR>The MSME CRA PA can be found at: http://www.arl.army.mil/CRAMSME <BR><BR>To accomplish the objectives of this CRA, the Army envisions the PA will establish an environment for the Alliance to advance technology by conducting a number of individual, coordinated and collaborative research tasks based upon a series of consistent, yet flexible annual research plans that will be highly responsive to the needs of the Army and Department of Defense (DoD).  These plans will include the interchange of scientists and engineers from among the Alliance participants, as well as educational opportunities that will serve to strengthen the ability of the Alliance and the larger research community to create new understanding and improved electronic device applications to include sensors and electronics for enhanced battlespace effects and efficient power and energy devices.  <BR><BR>This PA will result in the award of one Cooperative Agreement (CA) as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for execution of the program. The CA will be awarded to a Recipient that must be an academic institution.  Additionally, it is required that "covered educational institutions" (to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions or HBCU/MSIs receive 5-10% of the annual funding under the cooperative agreement.  <BR><BR>Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the recipient for the MSME CRA.  Planned funding levels for the CA are set forth in the MSME CRA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the MSME CRA for five years with an option for an additional five years.  <BR><BR>An Opportunity Conference for the Multiscale Research CRA projects was held on 19 November 2010 and an Open House was held on 9 December 2010.  Briefings, Posters, Q&A's, and links from these events can be found at: http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=532 <BR><BR>Proposals for the MultiScale multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic materials (MSME) Collaborative Research Alliance are due 07 March 2011 with an award expected in February 2012.<BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (Soldier, Chemical, Research & Test), RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is issuing a Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-11-R-0001, for the establishment of a Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) for Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments (MEDE).  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Research Laboratory is seeking to develop the capability to design, optimize, and fabricate lightweight protection material systems exhibiting revolutionary performance. The approach is to realize a "Materials by Design" capability by establishing a new Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) focused on Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments (MEDE). The focus of the CRA will be to advance the fundamental understanding of materials in relevant high strain rate and high stress regimes.  The CRA is intended to create a collaborative environment that enables an Alliance of participants from academia, government and potentially industry and/or non-profit organizations to advance the state of the art and assist with the transition of research to enhance the performance of materials of interest to the U.S. Army.  The ARL believes that the establishment of this CRA, as part of an ARL "Enterprise for Multiscale Research of Materials" and in conjunction with a robust internal mission program, provides the optimum path to success.  It is envisioned that the results of the MEDE CRA research will be efficiently and rapidly transitioned to ARL in-house research and development programs.<BR><BR>To address this problem, the MEDE CRA seeks proposals focusing on one polymer, one metal, one ceramic, and one composite material system. A successful program will demonstrate a comprehensive "materials-by-design" capability for materials in high strain rate and high stress environments and for each of the four material classes listed above address the following core elements:  (1)  Advanced Experimental Techniques: Develop experimental methodologies to interrogate and characterize the in-situ materials response to extreme dynamic environments at  critical length and time scales; (2) Modeling and Simulation: Develop computational approaches to predict the materials response to extreme dynamic environments at critical length and time scales; (3) Bridging the Scales: Develop physical and mathematical constructs necessary to bridge critical length and time scales; (4) Material Characteristics and Properties at Multiple Scales: Utilize existing and novel experimental methodologies to validate computational approaches in order to bridge the characteristic length and time scales, and to identify the comprehensive set of material characteristics, microstructural features and dynamic properties that govern high stress and high strain-rate deformation and failure phenomena ; and (5) Synthesis and Processing: Incorporate research discoveries to enable the synthesis of novel materials and the processing of final products with critical material characteristics and resulting properties.<BR><BR>The MEDE CRA PA can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/CRAMEDE.    <BR><BR>This PA will result in the award of one Cooperative Agreement (CA) as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the program. The CA will be awarded to a Consortium of organizations that may include academic, industrial and non-profit organizations.  To assure the creation of a well focused research program, the consortium will be kept small, with an optimally sized consortium containing no more than six members.  The Consortium must be led by an academic institution that will be charged with spearheading the focused research program. Additionally, it is required that "covered educational institutions" (to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions) shall receive 5-10% of the annual CA funding.<BR><BR>Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the consortium for the MEDE CRA.  Planned funding levels for the CA are set forth in the MEDE CRA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the MEDE CRA for five years with an option for an additional five years.  <BR><BR>An Opportunity Conference was held on Friday, 19 November 2010 and an Open House was held on 16 December 2010.

Organizational Change Management
Department of Veterans Affairs
VHA Chief Business Office (CBO)/Purchased Care
Denver, CO

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

1.0	SUBJECT

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VHA Chief Business Office (CBO) Purchased Care Business Line is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gain an better understanding of the scope of services and resources available and costs associated with providing Organizational Change Management Consulting Services to the CBO Purchased Care's as it reorganizes to better meet the goals and objectives of the organization.
 
2.0	DESCRIPTION

The VHA CBO Purchased Care Business Line provides national leadership for advancing business practices that support patient care and delivery of health benefits.   For more information please visit the VHA CBO website at http://www1.va.gov/cbo/.  One of CBO's strategic objectives is to "achieve operational excellence across all CBO business lines and programs," which entails continuous cycles of business, technical, and cultural change.  Implementing an effective change management plan significantly mitigates disruption and ensures all stakeholders are better prepared for and involved in achieving and sustaining those changes.  

Purchased Care supports a broad range of activities, providing management, operational support and oversight of health care services purchased by VHA. These critical programs represent VHA's roles as a payer in the health care industry, while also augmenting our role as a key provider of health care services for Veterans and their beneficiaries.  The Purchased Care Business Line (PCBL) manages VHA's only health care benefit programs delivering services to spouses and dependents of certain Veterans - CHAMPVA, Spina Bifida (SB) and Children of Women Vietnam Veterans (CWVV). In addition, PCBL manages and oversees numerous Veteran focused programs including the traditional Non-VA (Fee Basis) Program, the State Home Per Diem Program and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP). These joint programs provide health care services to 1.5M covered lives and FY10 expenditures greater than $6B.

As with all health care payer programs, standardization of business practices is critical to efficient and cost effective operations. In addition, strong attention to managing improper payments, fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) and equity in benefit decisions across programs is key to appropriate outcomes for both beneficiary satisfaction and assuring stewardship of public funds.  
Within the PCBL, there has been a wide variation in the level of standardization in each of these component areas. At present, the CHAMPVA, SB and FMP programs have a centralized structure, affording PCBL the opportunity to apply standardized decision capabilities, strong program integrity activities and industry standard tools to assure rigorous management of financial controls. These programs are supported by a significant staff knowledge base of managing health care payer programs, affording PCBL and the CBO with a strong cadre of corporate expertise.  

These same programmatic controls have not been applied across other PCBL programs, in particular the Non-VA and State Home Per Diem Programs. This is due in part to the decentralized nature of those programs. The decentralization does not preclude PCBL from aggressively pursuing program improvement activities for these critical programs. In addition, due to the current organizational structure within PCBL, there is duplication of activities inherent in maintaining segregated functions such as policy sections devoted to each program area (this is one example of duplication of activities). It is critical that the PCBL take aggressive actions to resolve these variations in our programmatic delivery while building on the excellent historical knowledge base and expertise within the business line and assuring that all programs benefit from the application of these standards. 

Stages are envisioned for the overall change of the organization.  The initial is realignment of corporate management and work functions.  The longer term and later phases are expected to address the activities outside of the corporate structure.

Key components of the organizational change include:

o	Build on current expertise in the health care payer community
o	Cohort like functions to assure the most effective operations
o	Decrease variation in program administration
o	Utilize common payment tool sets to assure transparency across programs and maximize fraud/waste/abuse opportunities
The work of the consultant(s) is intended to:

o	Conduct an organizational scan and assessment or the readiness for change
o	Review of existing change management work teams, their structure and their existing plans and provision of expert advice for enhancements to these
o	Coaching and training of VA management and staff for effectively implementing the changes and successfully restructuring the organization
o	Assistance and guidance with project planning to guide the reorganization
o	Assistance and guidance with communications planning, development and execution

The following questions are posed in order to obtain needed knowledge of the services available from consulting agencies experienced with assisting organizations with major internal realignment.

1.	What is your company background, experience , and capability with organizational change management? Please provide a brief narrative no longer than on page in length.
2.	Much work is underway with work teams defined for change management, communications, implementation, impact analysis, and metrics development/measurement.   However, validation of the existing effort is needed along with coaching and advisement to insure maximum effectiveness of these teams.  Is this requirement consistent with industry practices?
3.	What factors go into the determination of how many and what types of consulting resources are necessary for an organization change such as described?
4.	What are the key elements/requirements that our office should request to be certain we get the right services and contractual arrangement in place?
3.0	SUBMISSION INFORMATION REQUIRED

Please include, at a minimum, the following information in the initial paragraph of the submission:

	-Vendor information, including point of contact and phone number
	-A rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this effort
	-Website
-GSA, MOBIS, or other GWAC, if available.  Please include number, expiration date, etc...

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT's) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) plans to award a contract, purchase order or delivery order to Sybase, Inc., for the software maintenance services described below, for the calendar year 2011. The maintenance will cover technical support and updates for the Sybase IQ software, which is part of the RITA/BTS Enterprise Architecture. The maintenance is usually renewed on an annual basis. <br /><br />The RITA/BTS Office of Airline Information TranStats Internet and Intranet Program make extensive use of the Sybase IQ Database software produced by Sybase, Inc. The Sybase IQ software is part of the RITA/BTS Enterprise Architecture. RITA/BTS has internet and Intranet data warehouse applications based on Sybase IQ database technology and the data warehouse is growing. Sybase charges an annual maintenance fee for their software, which covers technical support. There are updates to the software as well. It is essential that the TranStats Program receive the updates to remain up to date with the latest data warehouse technology. Sybase is the sole manufacturer of Sybase IQ database software, and is the sole provider of maintenance for their Sybase IQ database software. The Integrated Airline Information System (IAIS) currently under development using other database technology will replace TranStats so it is anticipated that this will be the last year Sybase maintenance will be required. <br /><br />USDOT has no other option for purchasing maintenance for the Sybase IQ database software, because Sybase, Inc. is the sole manufacturer for the Sybase IQ database software and the sole provider of maintenance for their Sybase IQ database software. Sybase is the only available source for these services. <br /><br />Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than Sybase will be able to provide this maintenance. <br /><br />Nevertheless, any entity, other than Sybase, Inc., which believes they can provide the needed software maintenance services to RITA shall submit a capability statement to Pamala.millbrook.ctr@dot.gov no later than 1:00 PM EST on January 31, 2011. <br />
