<a href="mailto:wilma.estrada@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Contracting Command, intends to award a non-commercial, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for the research and development of Stretch Broken Carbon Fiber (SBCF) material forms. This effort seeks to develop and qualify SBCF material forms for use on military aircraft. The anticipated effort includes; design, analysis, process development, test article fabrication, testing, prototyping, production scale-up, and the acquisition of qualification data for aerospace market penetration. AATD intends to award one, cost-plus-fixed fee, IDIQ contract with an anticipated award date of September 15, 2010. The estimated maximum value of the contract will be $9.9 million. The minimum order value will be $3.05M and will be obligated concurrently with award of the IDIQ contract. This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation will be issued. The intended source is Hexcel Corporation, located in 6700 West 5400 South, Salt Lake City, UT 84118. The SBCF material form is unique in that it provides the property performance of continuous carbon fiber with the formability of sheet molding compound. This combination of capabilities will allow a significant increase in the use of composites in airframe parts that are currently too difficult or costly to make from continuous carbon fiber material.  SBCF is based on a proprietary technology developed and matured by Hexcel which has resulted in Hexcel being the only firm holding the development and manufacturing knowledge necessary to successfully satisfy the Army requirement. Additionally, Hexcel is the only supplier of this material and the sole owner of the patent (US 6,477,740 granted November 12, 2002) necessary to make this product and as such, it is not anticipated industry is capable of developing a similar product without infringing on Hexcels patent. Specifications or plans relating to this product are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government to another contractor. Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Hexcel Corporation and individual task orders will be issued. The contract requirement and subsequent orders will be developed jointly between the Government and Hexcel, consistent with alpha contracting procedures and applicable cost principles, clauses, and provisions in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). Performance locations and deliverables will vary and will be identified in each task order. The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is five years with no options. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541712 and the size standard is 1500 employees. This notice is not a request for proposals; however, while the Government does not anticipate competition, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by AATD. Proposals submitted in response to this notice are due no later than June 14, 2010, 1:00 p.m. EST. Written proposals shall be submitted to AATD, ATTN: CCAM-RDT, Wilma Estrada (Contract Specialist) and Linda Diedrich (Contracting Officer), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577 or may be emailed to wilma.estrada@us.army.mil and linda.diedrich@us.army.mil. Phone numbers for points of contact are Wilma Estrada at (757) 878-5003 or Linda Diedrich at (757) 878-4828. Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this notice must request it in writing at the above mailing or email addresses.  To ensure a timely response, written questions should be submitted not later than 4:00 p.m. EST, 31 May 2010.  Additional information: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Contracting Center (RDECOM-CC) intends to award a purchase order in the amount of $80,000.00 on the basis of other than full and open competition to Techline Technologies, Inc. located in Willow Grove, PA for the creation and assembly of (5) severe trauma simulation prototype kits. Each kit will be composed of simulated wounds developed under contract N61339-07-C-0038.  The required nine (9) wounds are as follows:  Full Leg Amputation (Right), Closed Arm Fracture (Right), Partial Leg Amputation (Right), Partial Arm Amputation (Right), Abdominal Evisceration (Tuckable Bowel), Multiple GSW to Abdomen, Blast Face, Shrapnel Arm (Right), Burned Arm (Right).  The anticipated period of performance will be five months.<BR><BR>The RDECOM-STTC determined full and open competition is not possible for the following reasons:<BR><BR>"	As prototypes, only Techline Technologies, Inc. has the moulds required to produce the simulation wounds.  Any other vendors would be required to develop new tooling in order to recreate the specific simulated wounds.  Based on historical contract data, it is estimated that a new vendor starting from the beginning would require at least six months development time to recreate the required nine wounds.  This delay would fail to meet the mission requirements to utilize the prototype kits to complete validation testing under contract W91CRB-10-C-0008 by the end of Fiscal Year 2010.  <BR><BR>"	A new vendor would also expend an additional $25,000.00 to make the specialized moulds required to produce the five (5) prototype kits.  <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 326199.  A response to this notice is not required.     See Numbered Note 22.  Email your questions to RDECOM Contracting Center - Aberdeen at nikia.s.jelks@us.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic Testing of Seat and Restraint Combinations for Use in the Ambulance Patient Compartment.<br /><br /></span>Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient litter, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have developed an SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. This proposed document has been approved for further development by SAE and is now in its final revision with a vote to approve and accept as final expected this spring. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely exempt from this requirement.
<p>Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, a request for proposal was developed and posted in January 2010 to complete this work. A total of four (4) side impact tests will be performed. The resulting dataset will be used to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (proposed). The testing is expected to be conducted in the spring of 2010, with the development of the proposed SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact Testing expected to be completed and approved by SAE in late fall 2010.</p>
<p>The project team is also now completing development of a new AMD standard, "AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST." This newly proposed AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all patient compartment designated seating positions, seat mounting systems, and associated occupant restraints when installed per seat and restraint manufacturer's information. This is expected to be performed as a type test.</p>
<p>The Contractor selected under this Request for Proposal will utilize the testing practices described in the two SAE Recommended Practices described in above, to conduct dynamic testing of Emergency Worker Seating Systems (any unique combination of a seat, seat mounting system, restraint system and seat adjusters which could be used as a designated seating position) in accordance with the proposed AMD Standard 026.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>This contract will evaluate seating and restraint systems, supplied by a variety of seat and restraint manufacturers. Seating systems will be single standalone seats (captain chair), as well as, bench seats, each using a variety of worker restraint types and styles. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Qualify the logic described in the proposed AMD 026 standard for the development of seated and restrained occupant head paths or "stay out zones" during dynamic events.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrated the ability of seat and restraint manufacturers to construct a variety of seat and restraint options that allow a belted worker to meet all FMVSS biomechanical limits, as proposed in the draft AMD 026 standard, while undergoing "crash-like" loading defined in each of the SAE Recommended Practices (front and side impacts).</p>
<p>3. Provide the data necessary for AMD and its partners to describe each seat and restraint combination and seat attitude - a function of "stay-out-zone" calculations and Anthropometric Test Device (ATD) response data (biomechanical data) - to perhaps reduce the number of dynamic tests required for the qualification of each seat and restraint combination. Example - does the data indicate AMD 026 should require seat and restraint manufacturers utilize only the higher frontal pulse for all designs regardless of seat attitude with respect to the impact direction?</p>
<p>4. Provide baseline data on current bench seats equipped with both Type 1 and Type 2 belts with wall and seat cushion included.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">May 14, 2010</span></strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 15, 2010</span></strong>.

<p>The project team is also now completing a revision of "AMD STANDARD 004 - Proposed Revision - LITTER RETENTION SYSTEM DYNAMIC TEST". This proposed revision of the AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all litter and patient restraint systems to be installed in an ambulance. This is expected to be performed as a type test once approved.</p>
<p>The Contractor will utilize the testing practices described in the two SAE Recommended Practices described above, to conduct dynamic testing of various combinations of litters, patient restraints, and litter retention hardware in accordance with the proposed revision to AMD Standard 004.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</p>
<p>This contract will dynamically test and evaluate litters, patient restraints, and litter retention hardware, hereafter referred to as "litter systems", as supplied by a several different litter manufacturers, to be identified under a separate solicitation. Litter systems may be mounted longitudinally or laterally, with the longitudinal axis assumed to be the fore/aft axis of the traditional ambulance patient compartment. Likewise, while mounted longitudinally, the litter system may be mounted with either the feet pointed toward hypothetical front of the vehicle or pointed aft as is required in the GSA Star-of-Life Ambulance Purchase Specification today. The overarching goal of this effort is to retain the litter system during crash loading while safely maintaining the patient on the gurney. This would correct two significant issues found during earlier testing.</p>
<p>At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate the ability to manufacture a litter system which will remain attached to the floor in frontal and side crash events as defined in the two SAE Recommended Practice documents.</p>
<p>2. Substantially reduce patient excursions (longitudinally and laterally) without driving biomechanical loading on the patient beyond published limits.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate the ability of litter manufacturers to construct a litter system that can be safely deployed in a side loading ambulance.</p>
<p>4. Validate the testing requirements and methodology described in the proposed revision to AMD 004.</p>
<p>5. Generate patient excursion envelopes for use in design of litter system to vehicle interface.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> on or about <strong>May 14, 2010</strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong>June 15, 2010</strong>.

<p>The project team is also now completing development of a new AMD standard, "AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST." This newly proposed AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all patient compartment designated seating positions, seat mounting systems, and associated occupant restraints when installed per seat and restraint manufacturer's information. This is expected to be performed as a type test.<br />While significant improvements in worker safety are expected as a result of these new standards, seating and restraint industry partners have freely acknowledged they have been unable to locate suitable seat and floor tracks to accommodate the unique mobility needs of EMS workers found during patient care activities. Those mobility needs stem from the nature of the work tasks expected of the EMS worker. Specifically, the EMS worker is expected to be able to address patient needs from head to foot. Given the length of the average person when in a supine position on a gurney, this nearly impossible to do while remaining seated and restrained.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first objective is to investigate alternate floor track designs which would allow the worker to remain seated and restrained while accessing the full length of the patient, from head to toe, on a seat that is able to slide on a track along the length of the patient. The second objective of this contracting effort is to identify or design a seat track that will allow the patient to slide closer to or further from the patient while at a fixed location at the patient's side. The seat will need to lock and remain in place whether impact from the front or rear. Once both track systems have been identified, designed, and manufactured, the floor and seat tracks will be dynamically tested to the latest draft standards as part of a validation of both the test standards and the floor and seat track designs.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</p>
<p>The Contract will conduct a market search to identify viable floor and seat track systems for use in ground ambulances to safely increase EMS worker access to the patient. If viable solutions cannot be identified, the Contractor will propose a new design to meet the challenges of this unique environment. Once designed and manufactured, the Contractor will install two or three different seat and restraint system combinations, supplied by commercial vendors as identified under a separate solicitation. Seating systems utilized will be single standalone seats (captain's chair. At the completion of this design and testing program the Contractor will have:</p>
<p>1. Developed a pedestal mounted seat track that can be be positioned in either a forward facing or aft facing orientation while retaining its ability to lock in place in the event of either a frontal or rear impact.</p>
<p>2. Developed a floor track that allows the worker to travel the length of the patient (e.g., 6 ft) in a track that will lock the seat firmly in place and retain the seat and worker with measured biomechanical values falling below limits specified by AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST".</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about <strong>May 13, 2010</strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong>June 14, 2010</strong>.

<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-10-54@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of adaptive, high performance structural systems. As the demands on military platforms and buildings increase, so does the need for structures that can mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments. Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve only extreme stiffness. The Structural Logic program seeks to enable structural systems that adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping. By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and adaptive dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms, and buildings with the ability to continually change their properties to match the demands of an ever evolving environment.<br /><br />See attached DARPA-BAA-10-54 for complete information.

<DESC>1.	The FAA intends to award a single source contract to Telewave, Inc., 660 Giguere Court, San Jose, CA 95133.
2.	RF Cavity Filters featuring a proprietary folded cavity design.
3.	The total estimate value of this procurement is $80,000. 
4.  The authority for this procurement is AMS 3.2.2.4.  
5.	This procurement is for the sole source acquisition of RF Cavity Filters/Combiners that are to be used to establish a new Air to Ground Radio Communications capability at the Boise International Airport.  The procurement is part of the Boise ATCT Replacement project, JCN 410783.  Installation of the RG Cavity Filers is scheduled to start in late June, early July 2010 time frame.
The RF Cavities of interest are manufactured by Telewave, Inc, and feature a proprietary folded cavity design.  The core of this procurement is the Telewave cavity filters listed below:
	TWPC-1405-1F - 	TWPC-1405-2F -	TWPC 2205F -	TWPC-3507F -
The Telewave "folded cavity" design is the primary salient characteristic that is not currently available from other manufacturers.  The advantage of the "folded cavity" over other units is the reduced sizes that allow it to easily fit on a 26" deep electronic equipment rack and mount on a standard 19" panel.  Folded cavities are special coaxial cavities which are about 3/4 as long as a standard 1/4 wave cavity.  Telewave is the only known source that offers this feature in its cavity filter design.
6.	Competitive solicitations are not available for this procurement.  However if you have questions about this announcement, please respond by email to clarence.davis@faa.gov by close of business (4:00 P.M. Western Time) May 10, 2010.

This study requires access to a closed course (road that the contractor can close to traffic) with installed or temporary lighting systems that can be switched from one type of lighting to another. The study also requires access to eye-tracking systems (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking</span></a>) and may require use of a dynamic vehicle-mounted luminance camera (example:<a href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VTTI/reports/Luminance_Camera_021109.pdf"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VTTI/reports/Luminance_Camera_021109.pdf</span></a>). The use of eye-tracking is necessary to fully understand when a driver looks at an object or pedestrian on or along the roadway, while the luminance camera will provide the research team with accurate data on differences in the luminance contrast under different lighting systems. Combining these data sets will provide insight into whether or not different spectral power distributions allow for similar responsivity under different light levels.</span></p>

<DESC>The Forest Service is requesting proposals for replacement and upgrade on Republic Ranger District Office, building # 2019, remove and replace existing composition roofing 
(approx. 7150 SF) and sheathing.  The building is 5 years old and exhibiting moisture related failures of the roof system.

The current roof system has wings with gable ends and the main part of the building is vaulted roof system.  Work includes furring up the roof, re-sheathing with plywood, enhancing ventilation; re-flashing roof, installing baffled ridge vents, replacing fascia, reroofing with standing seam metal roof and humidistat controlled fans in gable end walls. There also will be a bid alternate for reroofing with composition roofing. Contract performance time is 60 days.  Work will need to be done in phases so building is not exposed to the elements.  The job site is located on the Republic Ranger District compound in Republic, Washington, Ferry County.  Solicitations will be available on or about May 14, 2010.  Engineering point of contact is Lou Janke, Facilities Engineer, Colville National Forest, telephone:  (509) 684-7230.  A site visit is tentatively set for April 6, 2010 at 10 am meeting at the Gillette Campground.   Estimated project value $25,000 to $100,000 NAICS 238160 with size $14.0 mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD) through RFP DTMA1F10023 is seeking professional architect-engineering (A/E) services (more specifically, professional Naval Architect and Marine Engineering services or "design agents") to develop and provide a Conceptual Design Engineering Report and Conceptual General Arrangement Drawings for the Conversion of the SS CAPE GIBSON. Upon completion, MARAD will meet with the regulatory body authorities (United States Coast Guard (USCG) HQ, USCG Marine Safety Center and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)) in Washington, DC.  Design agent participation in this meeting(s) in a consultation capacity will be required.  The SS CAPE GIBSON, built in 1968 at Newport News Shipbuilding, is currently docked in Galveston, TX, at the Texas Maritime Academy (TMA).  Basic information and photos of this vessel can be obtained at this public webpage: http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/13/135051.htm. This vessel is certified by the USCG and is classed by ABS as a Freight Ship and General Cargo Vessel respectively.  It is the intent of MARAD, the vessel owner, to convert this vessel during two separate phases into a certified and classed Public Nautical School Ship for assignment to TMA. It is envisioned that the first phase (or "Phase I") of the conversion will increase the carrying capacity to a total of 200 persons (160 cadets and 40 officers, crew and staff). It is envisioned that the second phase (or "Phase II") of the conversion will increase the carrying capacity to a total of 565 persons (500 cadets and 65 officers, crew and staff). The USCG and U.S. Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR") define this conversion project as a "Major Conversion". A firm-fixed price contract for these services is anticipated.  The estimated start and completion dates are June 9, 2010 and August 20, 2010.
The selected design agent shall provide: 1. a Conceptual Design Engineering Report, to include preliminary engineering analysis, calculations and estimates; 2. Conceptual General Arrangement Drawings for both phases: Phase I and Phase II of the conversion project; 3. Rough Order Magnitude or "ROM" cost estimates for accomplishment of Phase I and Phase II during future shipyard periods.  Furthermore, the selected design agent shall provide or perform: 4. Two or more detailed surveys or ship checks of the vessel at its current location; 5. During these same visits, meet with and interview the ship's crew and TMA shore side administrative staff; 6. During these same visits, discuss and verify the validity and accuracy of the existing TMA "Requirements Document" with the ship's crew and TMA admin staff; 7. Analyze, verify and update the validity and accuracy of the existing MARAD "Gap Analysis" Document; 8. Subsequent visits to the CAPE GIBSON and TMA will include presenting first drafts of deliverables to TMA and MARAD representatives for review, discussion, analyses, edit and revision; 9. Upon concurrence with TMA and MARAD of the Conceptual Design Engineering Report and the Conceptual General Arrangement Drawings, these deliverables shall be presented to the USCG and ABS (in one or possibly more meetings in Washington, DC) for USCG and ABS concurrence and approval of the design approach; modifications are to be made to these deliverables as necessary and as required in order to obtain USCG and ABS concurrence and approval.  
At the successful completion of these tasks, the government may (at its discretion) exercise an Option to the design agent to develop and provide a detailed, shipyard construction-level design package for Phase I only. This package shall include all necessary engineering and technical analyses, calculations, specifications and arrangement/system drawings, consistent with detailed, contract level solicitations and at a level of detail sufficient for all regulatory body (ABS and USCG) approval. If exercised by the government, this Option will have a delivery due date of December 31, 2010, and subject documentation, specifications and drawings must all be stamped approved by ABS and USCG by that due date.   When responding to this announcement, design agents must fully address their capability, qualifications and past experience with regard to each of the evaluation criteria specified below. Design agents should submit their complete qualifications as they may be evaluated solely on their written responses. Oral interviews may be held at the discretion of the government. Design agents interested in submitting their qualifications for this procurement must utilize a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineering Qualifications Form with supplemental forms as necessary. Design agents must fully address their capability, qualifications and past experience which will be measured against the three (3) evaluation factors listed below in order of importance, to be considered by a source selection board.1.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Genedata (USA), Inc. One Cranberry Hill, Suite 304, Lexington, MA 02451 for the renewal of a 1 year license for Genedata Screener and Hit Profiler Software. The National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) requires a database and tools that must have the following capabilities: (1) Flexibility in building templates for calculation of raw plate based data; (2) Visualization of plate based data for QC analysis; (3) Robust concentration response curve fitting routine; (4) Ability to link chemicals in sample plates to assay results; (5) Operational database supporting mass storage of data and analysis results. A large amount of data for ToxCast will be generated at the National Institutes of Health, Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC). Their unique approach to HTS, termed quantitative HTS (qHTS), tests all chemical in concentration response format. This presents unique challenges in data QC and management. Curve fitting routines must be extremely robust to routinely and efficiently handle thousands of test results. This is an absolutely critical step in the qHTS data from NCGC. In addition, other products have laborious procedures required to build specific templates for calculating raw data for HTS assays. Because ToxCast will be acquiring data from a number of different sources and for a large number of different assays (hundreds), the ability to easily build templates for data calculation sophisticated visualization of plate based data, an interface to link sample information with assay results, and an operational database sufficient to meet the long term requirements of the ToxCast Program. Genedata Screener hit Profiler is a software application that provides access to the heterogeneous research data that make up the ToxCast and Tox21 toxicity screening results in an easy-to-use interactive environment. It is an extension of the Genedata Screener database system currently be use to process all concentration-response data and to provide QC analysis on some of the single-concentration screening data. The Hit Profiler offers unique capabilities for data visualization and efficient filtering and reporting results Biological activity including potency determination and associated statistics, chemical structure and properties and additional data can be brought together and compared across biological targets. This offers an important view of the bioactivity profiles of chemicals of interest. Hit Profiler is currently being used by NCCT and has produced robust performance. Thousands of chemical have been examined across up to 12 biological targets without problems. This is sufficient for the need of the ToxCast and Tox21 screening efforts. There are no other products on the market that will integrate with the Genedata Screener database to access these concentration-response curves. Visualization of these curves is a very important component in interpreting the biological significance of the results. The EPA has identified Genedata (USA), Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1, Only one Responsible Source". The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement for Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) <br />As of 26 April 2010<br /><br />Purpose: The mission of the Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is to develop a strategic purchasing plan for the Air Force's future health care support service requirements that is efficient and effective. Some goals of strategic sourcing are to leverage resources, define common specifications, reduce redundancy, streamline processes and improve efficiencies with strategically placed contracts or ordering instruments. This sources sought announcement seeks industry comments on future AFMSCC strategies for medical administrative support services. This is a request for information only; no contract will result from responses received for this RFI. This is not a Request for Proposal, an Invitation to Bid, or a Request for Quotation. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI. <br /><br />Background: The AFMSCC administers and manages the Medical Administrative Support Services (MASS) contracts, a 5-year, $96.4 million program that is scheduled to end in April 2012. In an effort to begin strategy development and market research for the next set of strategic contract vehicles, the AFMSCC is seeking sources to provide contracted health care personnel in Air Force military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) at geographically dispersed Air Force bases in the Continental United States as well as overseas. The work supports healthcare services provided by Air Force military personnel, DoD civilian employees, and other contract staff and provides new capabilities at the MTFs if required.<br /><br />Under the current MASS program, the Air Force Medical Service contracts for administrative occupations that do not involve direct medical treatment or hands-on patient care. These include (but are not limited to): appointing, coding, medical records, transcription, and other clerical positions supporting MTF mission and support functions such as logistics, supply, and billing activities. MASS currently does not include advisory and assistance services, food service, housekeeping, information systems, biomedical or facility maintenance. However, the AFMSCC is considering adding biomedical, facility, safety and public health services if that is in-line with industry practices. Therefore, the AFMSCC is interested in learning if industry deems it appropriate to expand available services in any follow-on program and which other labor categories may be appropriate to add. The NAICS code used for the original contracts is 621999 (All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Service) with a size standard of $9M for MASS.<br /><br />Requirement: The AFMSCC is initiating development of a new acquisition strategy. The number, scope and geographic coverage for personnel, as well as the type of contract and acquisition methodology has not been determined at this time. We are seeking large and small business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity that industry can provide for anticipated medical administrative support service as well as some requirements worldwide. In addition, information is being sought for alternative NAICS used by industry for similar services.<br /><br />Response: Interested businesses capable of providing medical administrative support services should respond to the survey questions at the following link:<br /><br />http://mcix.com/survey<br /><br />The&nbsp;survey may take 15-20 minutes depending upon the type of services offered by your company. Your willingness to provide the details requested will be invaluable to the Government during this planning phase.<br /><br />Notice: The AFMSCC has non-Government employees (i.e., contractor employees) assisting with market research from the companies listed below. These non-Government employees have all signed non-disclosure agreements and will have access to industry responses. The following companies are also contractually bound not to compete for these requirements.<br /><br />Suntiva<br />Infinity<br />Monterey Consultants<br /><br />Submitting your answers in the survey link above is the Government's preferred data collection method. Please complete the survey by 28 May 2010.<br /><br /><br />Ms. Tina Altevers<br />Program Manager,<br />Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council<br />(937) 255-0484 <br />tina.altevers@wpafb.af.mil

<DESC>A. Description<br />This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a Request for Information to assist the United States Air Force (USAF) in Market Research of Industry to identify potential sources that may meet service requirements for Modification of Systems and Equipment related to the Control and Reporting Center (CRC). The CRC was formerly known as Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS). The Governments preferred solution is for the contractor to utilize employees who have battle management command and control experience, and specific experience on the CRC network of systems (e.g. AN/TPS-75 Radar, AN/TLQ-32 Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Decoy, AN/TYQ-23 Modular Control Equipment (MCE), AN/TSC-147 Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module (JM), etc.). The Modification of Systems and Equipment service includes the providing of systems integration; modifications and upgrade (including software, firmware, and hardware); installation of equipment; and system training and maintenance. These services will also be accomplished in Air Control Squadrons worldwide (including in theater).
<p>Contractor shall:<br /><br />&bull; Provide answers to questions pertaining to implementation, maintenance, and operation of CRC systems to the CRC System Sustainment Management Office (SSMO) <br />&bull; Provide software and hardware testing, evaluation and integration; installation of software, firmware, and hardware modifications/upgrades and line replaceable units (LRUs)<br />&bull; Install AN/TYQ-23 software, and modify the Operations Module and JTIDS Module<br />&bull; Conduct engineering or feasibility assessments</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) to support the US Army Combat Readiness Center (USACRC) in the development of the Army Safety Management Information System (ASMIS-R) and its associated core systems.<BR><BR>INTRODUCTION  <BR><BR>The US Army Combat Readiness Center (USACRC), is seeking qualified contractors to support the research and development of Information Technology programs to support the Army Safety Management Information System  Revised (ASMIS-R)  <BR>    The USACRC intends to structure future contracts to align with the organizations strategic goals and objectives.  This potential contract would support the development of all ASMIS-R developmental work.   Superior performance on the contractors part will directly and indirectly link to superior USACRC mission accomplishment through the effective and efficient use of information technology.  The USACRC/contractor partnership will reflect the attributes of an open, collaborative, and customer-oriented professional relationship.  <BR><BR> BACKGROUND    <BR><BR>The fundamental purpose of this effort would be to support the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center, Army Safety Management Information System Revised (ASMIS-R) and the development of the associated core systems of ASMIS-R consisting of; Report It, Analyze It, Track It and Prevent It.  The Army Safety Management Information System  Revised (ASMIS-R) is a regulated core system containing approximately 35 years of incident information data.  The modernization of ASMIS-R will support both Army transformation and the Department of the Armys Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) standards through a proactive Composite Risk Management (CRM) approach.  This approach takes a more holistic view of the Army and its resources, weather active duty, reserve, civilian, or contractor.  The modernization goal is to create a single Army (SOH) information reporting system that collects, compiles, tracks, abates, analyzes, and reports accidents, incidents, injury or illness data on solders, civilians, and contractors across the Department of the Army.  <BR><BR>The USACRC has established the following objectives for this effort; <BR> <BR>1. Provide consolidated automated solutions to accommodate all Army reportable event types and classes for military (aviation and ground), civilian, and contractor events. <BR>2. Standardize reporting processes, by eliminating multiple systems and the costs associated.   <BR>3. Provide automated reporting solutions to Commands that currently use no event reporting systems, increase proportion of events reported. <BR>4. Improve ease of use to universally increase proportion of events reported, ensure visibility, availability of injury and illness event data to local commands, and HQDA organizations. <BR>5. Facilitate timely incident information reporting. <BR>6. Improve data input to capture complete and accurate incident data. <BR>7. Assist in accurately identifying injury and illness trends as well as safety, occupational health, and environmental hazards trends. <BR>8. Help decision-makers effectively identify and control key causes and cost of preventable events.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy (HT) were designed to determine whether HT had beneficial effects on health outcomes, especially cardiovascular health, in postmenopausal women. Women without uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg (Premarin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), or a matching placebo (also provided by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), and women with uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either CEE, 0.625 mg, and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 mg, (Prempro, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or a matching placebo (also provided by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) was an ancillary study (conducted with private funding) to the WHI and investigated the effects of CEE-containing HT on risk of probable dementia and any cognitive impairment and on changes in global cognition over time. WHIMS included 7,450 WHI participants enrolled at 39 of the 40 WHI clinical sites who were age 65 and older. Because WHIMS did not include detailed cognitive assessments of women without cognitive impairment, the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) was designed as an ancillary study to WHIMS to assess memory and other domain-specific cognitive functions in women free of dementia. WHISCA included 2,305WHIMS participants at 14 clinical sites and was conducted under contract number N01-AG-9-2115. The WHI and ancillary WHIMS and WHISCA studies were stopped earlier than planned for both the combination therapy (CEE+MPA in 2002) and CEE-Alone (in 2004) because these treatments increased health risks and did not protect against coronary heart disease. Although study medications were discontinued, follow-up assessments continued in WHIMS and WHISCA as well as the main WHI trials.</p>
<p>WHIMS and WHISCA were designed to test the hypothesis, suggested by results of observational studies, that HT had beneficial effects on maintenance of cognitive health in older post-menopausal women, reducing the risk for dementia and protecting against age-associated memory loss. Contrary to expectations, WHIMS showed that HT increased the risk for probable dementia and was associated with poorer global cognition, and WHISCA showed that CEE+MPA treatment was associated with poorer verbal memory over time and that CEE-Alone did not improve verbal memory.</p>
<p>The WHIMS and WHISCA protocols have transitioned from face-to-face to less costly and more efficient centrally based and validated telephone interviews to assess cognitive functioning. The WHIMS Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) continues through 2010 as part of the current WHI extension follow-up, with the WHIMS components funded by (N01-WH-4-4221), and includes assessments previously performed through WHIMS and WHISCA evaluations. Up to 3,900 women are expected to participate in the WHIMS-ECHO study.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y) is underway (funded by N01-WH-4-4221). In this study, the telephone-based WHIMS ECHO protocol is used to assess the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy among women who were 50-54 years of age at the time they were initially enrolled into the WHI hormone trials. Hormone therapy continues to be widely prescribed for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Further, there remains a strong belief among basic and clinical scientists that HT begun during the peri- or immediate post-menopausal periods may bestow cognitive benefits and that the cognitive harm associated with HT in the post-menopausal woman occurs only when there is some pre-existing, sub-clinical disease and/or the aging brain is more vulnerable to the possible negative effects of hormones. WHIMS-Y takes advantage of the rich WHI cohort by adding critical information on the clinical treatment of early post-menopausal women and on potential mechanisms of action for how HT may affect cognition. <br /><br />Thus, by the end of the current WHIMS extension period (N01-WH-4-4221), cognitive data will be available for a large portion of the women who participated in the WHI HT, with longitudinal cognitive data on the women who were 65 and older at the beginning of WHI as well as an initial and follow-up assessment for women who were 50-54 at baseline. The proposed continuation of WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y offers a unique opportunity to gain further insights into the antecedents of cognitive decline or stability, and further clarify the contributions of vascular disease in dementia. The ability to advance science by a systematic study of the predictors of decline or stability of cognitive health will be greatly enhanced by longer follow-up for up to 19 years. As the participants grow older, the proportion with cognitive impairment or dementia is expected to increase rapidly. Feasibility and cost will be explored with the offeror during negotiations.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES There are 2 objectives of this contract: Objective 1 - Continued surveillance of the WHIMS-ECHO cohort. The purpose of this objective is to investigate the long-term effects of HT on dementia risk and cognitive function in older postmenopausal women. This includes: a) Enhance statistical power to identify predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive resilience; b) Continue assessment of the adverse effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cognition as these women pass through the risk period for accelerated cognitive decline and impairment; and, c) Continue to serve as a national resource on which to build ancillary studies in collaboration with the greater scientific community. Objective 2 - Continued surveillance of the WHIMS-Y cohort. The purpose of this objective is to investigate the long-term effects of early treatment with HT on cognitive health. This includes: a) To determine the later impact of HT when administered to younger, more recently menopausal women; b) To determine whether these effects differ from the adverse effects observed in older postmenopausal women; and, c) To investigate mid-life predictors of cognitive decline and resilience.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS The Contractor shall coordinate the WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y data collection, including recruitment and scheduling of study participants, administration and scoring of the telephone assessment battery, determination and adjudication of diagnoses of probable dementia and mild cognitive impairment, and data entry and transfer. The Contractor also shall maintain close contact with the main WHI study and assessment schedule to ensure that relevant demographic and clinical variables are available or continue to be collected for WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y. The Contractor shall: 1) Maintain a high level of cooperation and coordination with WHI Investigators, the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR); 2) Provide equipment, where needed for test administration; 3) Train and supervise staff in the administration and scoring of the tests and other evaluation instruments; 4) Develop and validate procedures for central adjudication of diagnoses of dementia and mild cognitive impairment; 5) Perform computer data entry and transfer of data to the COTR; 6) Maintain the WHIMS web site; 7) Provide biostatistical and other support for data analysis, manuscript development, and preparation; and, 8) Coordinate the close-out of the study.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop or adapt informed consent materials for continued participation in WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y. The Contractor shall obtain appropriate institutional review board approvals from participating sites and shall provide copies of such to the COTR. The Contractor shall identify, recruit, and obtain informed consent for eligible WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y participants from ongoing study participants.

The WHIMS Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) continues through 2010 as part of the current WHI extension follow-up, with the WHIMS components funded by (N01-WH-4-4221), and includes assessments previously performed through WHIMS and WHISCA evaluations. Up to 3,900 women are expected to participate in the WHIMS-ECHO study.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y) is underway (funded by N01-WH-4-4221). In this study, the telephone-based WHIMS ECHO protocol is used to assess the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy among women who were 50-54 years of age at the time they were initially enrolled into the WHI hormone trials. Hormone therapy continues to be widely prescribed for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Further, there remains a strong belief among basic and clinical scientists that HT begun during the peri- or immediate post-menopausal periods may bestow cognitive benefits and that the cognitive harm associated with HT in the post-menopausal woman occurs only when there is some pre-existing, sub-clinical disease and/or the aging brain is more vulnerable to the possible negative effects of hormones. WHIMS-Y takes advantage of the rich WHI cohort by adding critical information on the clinical treatment of early post-menopausal women and on potential mechanisms of action for how HT may affect cognition.</p>
<p>Thus, by the end of the current WHIMS extension period (N01-WH-4-4221), cognitive data will be available for a large portion of the women who participated in the WHI HT, with longitudinal cognitive data on the women who were 65 and older at the beginning of WHI as well as an initial and follow-up assessment for women who were 50-54 at baseline. The proposed continuation of WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y offers a unique opportunity to gain further insights into the antecedents of cognitive decline or stability, and further clarify the contributions of vascular disease in dementia. The ability to advance science by a systematic study of the predictors of decline or stability of cognitive health will be greatly enhanced by longer follow-up for up to 19 years. As the participants grow older, the proportion with cognitive impairment or dementia is expected to increase rapidly. Feasibility and cost will be explored with the offeror during negotiations.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES There are 2 objectives of this contract: Objective 1 - Continued surveillance of the WHIMS-ECHO cohort. The purpose of this objective is to investigate the long-term effects of HT on dementia risk and cognitive function in older postmenopausal women. This includes: a) Enhance statistical power to identify predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive resilience; b) Continue assessment of the adverse effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cognition as these women pass through the risk period for accelerated cognitive decline and impairment; and, c) Continue to serve as a national resource on which to build ancillary studies in collaboration with the greater scientific community. Objective 2 - Continued surveillance of the WHIMS-Y cohort. The purpose of this objective is to investigate the long-term effects of early treatment with HT on cognitive health. This includes: a) To determine the later impact of HT when administered to younger, more recently menopausal women; b) To determine whether these effects differ from the adverse effects observed in older postmenopausal women; and, c) To investigate mid-life predictors of cognitive decline and resilience.<br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS The Contractor shall coordinate the WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y data collection, including recruitment and scheduling of study participants, administration and scoring of the telephone assessment battery, determination and adjudication of diagnoses of probable dementia and mild cognitive impairment, and data entry and transfer.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Acquisitions is seeking responsible offers from qualified contractors capable of providing the following requirement to The National Eye Institute (NEI):
Requirement
As part of an ongoing CRADA the MOGS/OGVFB/NEI has a need to carry out large scale SNP genotyping on 200 DNA samples.  Because of the scale of this project it can most efficiently and economically be carried out through an outside contract with a group experienced in this area and with all equipment and reagents in place.
NEI is seeking sources with experience in gene expression and genotyping microarray data production.  Preferably sources having developed core competencies around microarray processing.  Ability to successfully process RNA and DNA from different tissue types of human and animal, normal and diseased.  The need for a highly skilled contractor with the highest quality of data at each point in the process, from sample collection through the release of gene expression and genotyping data into our secure data warehouse is paramount.  To have separate laboratory areas for RNA, DNA, cDNA, IVT, PCR and array processing is considered.
Purpose
The NEI will use the genotyping data supplied to localize regions of the human genome containing risk regions for a variety of ophthalmic genetic diseases.  This will allow further characterization of these genetic regions in additional samples available to the MOGS/OGVFB/NEI and its collaborators.
Tasks
	The contractor will receive 200 verified high quality DNA samples of at least 260 ng each from MOGS/OGVFB/NEI and carry out genotyping on these using the ILLUMINA HUMAN CYTOSNP12 BEADCHIP system.  
	This will be carried out within 1 month of receiving the samples if possible.  MOGS/OGVFB/NEI will be responsible for quality assurance of the submitted DNA samples.  
	The contractor will be responsible for genotyping and quality assurance of the resulting data.  
	The contractor will not be responsible for problems with DNA quality or for analysis of the resulting data. 
Reports
-	Because of the short duration of the contract there will be no interim reports.  
-	Upon completion of genotyping Gene Logic will submit a single final report with data quality assessment overall, and SNPs analyzed and genotypes for each DNA sample submitted.
-	This report will be in the form of a csv file suitable for uploading into currently available analytical software including Golden Helix SVS after minimal data manipulation.
-	The contractor will submit the genotypes as a csv file with sample identifier, SNP or CNV marker, and genotype for each of the DNA samples to MOGS/OGVFB/NEI at 5635 Fishers Lane, Rockville Maryland.
NOTE
The data will be for MOGS/OGVFB/NEI use only and will be held confidentially by The contractor and not used for other work or research.
The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541712.  Contractors interested in satisfying this requirement shall send offers to The NIH Office of Acquisitions primary point of contact Keith Savage via emailing savagekei@od.nih.gov.

<DESC>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3. Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is issued for the purpose of identifying information on a reverse engineering and manufacture of flight control computer circuit card assemblies (CCAs) for the AV-8B aircraft. PMA-257 is issuing an RFI in an effort to determine potential sources and information on firms that can reverse engineer whole circuit card assemblies. This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). This is not a Research and Development (R&amp;D) request. PMA-257 is seeking information on affordable circuit card assembly manufacturing using the latest Commercial Off -The Shelf (COTS) technology. . <br /><br />Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) for Aircraft Based Flight Control Computer Platform
<p>The following is provided to potential vendors to provide insight into the governments thoughts at this date on Thresholds Requirements (must have) and objective requirements (beneficial to have). These pre - decisional thoughts on requirements are subject to change in a future RFP. <br /><br />1. Threshold:</p>
<p>a. All engineering drawings, interface requirements and definitions, test reports, and other pertinent data will be made available to the government. <br />b. Installation concept shall not require modification to existing aircraft hardware and software architecture. <br />c. No changes shall be required in the existing aircraft interface (same pin-outs without wiring for internal test points and same external dimensions).<br />d. The circuit card assemblies shall interface with the other existing flight control computer Circuit Card Assemblies.<br />e. These new reverse engineered cards shall be interfaced with current FCC CCAs and be powered by the existing 28V DC aircraft power.</p>
<p>2. Objectives:</p>
<p>a. Circuit cards should be "plug and play" and easily removed and replaced by higher levels of maintenance.</p>
<p>Interested parties qualified of providing the reverse engineered circuit cards, which meet or exceed the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC). This describes the vendor's existing proficiency to supply, modify, and sustain the system to aircraft out of service date.</p>
<p>The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above. A limit of twenty (20) pages is imposed for the responses. Responses should be received by close of business 30 days after release of RFI. <br />Please direct all questions to Michael A. Cocca at 301-342-9063. Again, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or any responses submitted as the result of this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The Removable Spillway Weir (RSW) in spillway bay 2 at Ice Harbor Dam is the primary passage route for downstream migrating juvenile salmonids.  The spillway slope at Ice Harbor is steeper than any of the other three dams on the Snake River, which are, in turn, steeper than the spillway slope at  McNary Dam on the Columbia River.  Biological tests and hydraulic models have shown that there is a potential for injury to some of the fish passing over the Ice Harbor spillway due to the steep slope and the abrupt transition to the surface of the existing spill deflector.  The intent of this project is to resolve this condition.  The magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Contractor will be required to modify the spillway chute and the spill deflector in spillway bay 2 and add new, permanent extensions to the downstream end of the spillway piers between bays 1 and 2, and bays 2 and 3.<BR><BR>The contractor will be required to isolate the construction area in the stilling basin and allow dewatering of the construction area in spillway bay 2 and set the bulkheads.  Once the bulkheads are in place, the area between the steel bulkheads and the spillway surface or the existing spillway piers can be dewatered.  Work on the spillway chute, deflector, and the pier extensions can then be accomplished in the dry.  Some water leakage is usually present so pumping will likely be required throughout the construction period.  <BR><BR>The contractor shall use a combination of saw cutting, drilling, and splitting to remove some concrete from the face of the existing spillway, leaving a roughened surface for placement of the new concrete forming the flatter spillway chute, new spill deflector, and the new pier extensions.  The removed concrete must be captured and not allowed to fall into the tailrace pool.  The work includes drilling and grouting concrete anchors into the face of the spillway followed by installation of reinforcing steel.  The contrator shall install concrete formwork and place concrete   for the spillway chute, the spill deflectors and the pier extensions.  All seepage water and other water from construction operations will be removed from the work area for appropriate treatment.  <BR><BR>Should the need arise to spill water during construction, any support barges outside of the work area will be removed.  Depending on levels of spill, construction may continue since the construction area is isolated from the river.  <BR><BR>Work must be accomplished during the normal in-water work window on the Snake River, between December 15, 2010 and March 1, 2011.  All new concrete must be placed with sufficient time for it to cure completely before court-ordered seasonal spill begins in early April 2011.<BR>The contractor will also be required to install Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag antennas in slots formed across the spillway surface.  The antenna design will require approximately four slots 4 to 6 deep by 5 wide with non-metallic cover plates covering the slots once the antennas are installed.  The antennas, shielding material, and electrical components will be government-furnished equipment, but the contractor will need to furnish electronic and power cables and air ducts and install all cables, air ducts, and the government-furnished equipment.<BR><BR>The new concrete added to the lower end of the spillway chute shall be deep enough to allow the contractor to create the lower slots entirely through forming and concrete placement.  The contractor will be required to saw-cut and remove existing concrete to ensure the upper slots are deep enough for the antennas.<BR><BR>Electronic cables and air ducts will run from the antenna slots in cableways formed into the new concrete or in trenches excavated into the existing concrete.  The cableways will run out to the new concrete in the pier wall extensions and provide a route to connect the antenna slots to electronic components located in a service gallery within the dam at the spillway bridge level.  Power cables will be run from an existing panel as close to spillway bay 2 as possible to provide power to the equipment in the gallery.<BR><BR>This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns with the capability to accomplish the work.  Only these firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement of their current or past technical experience (what the firm has done) and current or past performance(how well the firm did it) similar to or the same as the requirements stated above, will be used in the determination whether to set aside this requirement.  Include bonding capacity and a statement indicating your business is a HUBZone or Service Disable Veteran Owned small business concern to Jani Long, Contract Specialist, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, Washington 99362 or email responses to jani.c.long@usace.army.mil.   Your response to this notice must be received on or before close of business on May 5, 2010.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Veterans Relationship Management Program Executive OfficeVirtual Call Center PrototypeThe purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for the Veterans Relationship Management (VRM) Program's Virtual Call Center (VCC) Prototype. This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas, initiatives, and/or processes related to this request.The VRM Program is a multi-year program for Veterans, their families, and their agents' that will provide on-demand access to comprehensive VA services and benefits in a consistent, user-centric manner. To achieve this goal, VA will provide our stakeholders a multi-channel customer relationship management platform, including dramatically improved telephone services, which is the target of this proposal. In fact, modernization of our telephony capabilities and our agents' ability to access the data required to resolve Veteran's issues is a primary focal point of the VRM program.  Consequently, in an effort to systematically capture business requirements and create implementation specifications, our first step in accomplishing this objective is the development a VCC prototype to identify and document our user's needs.  Upon completion of this crucial phase, VA anticipates near-future steps will include building and conducting Call Center Pilots and full-scale Call Center rollouts.The VA is seeking Contractor support to provide a non-production VCC Prototype system that will be utilized to define enterprise requirements, to develop, explore, select, and refine tools and processes, and to create a detailed set of implementation blueprints suitable for Agile Process implementation.   The VCC Prototype must be flexible and capable of quickly simulating and testing new systems and processes. The VCC Prototype will be capable of accommodating three basic workflows: "	Provide a comprehensive view of Compensation Claim Status"	Provide a comprehensive view of Veteran Data "	Provide a comprehensive view of General Benefits InformationEach simulated workflows will have less than 15 steps simulating a task. The contractor shall make modifications to the workflow as required to support the call center simulation, and in rapid (ie, less than 24 hours) response to exploratory design and layout suggestions.  The intent of the VCC Prototype is to define processing workflows, to support the simulation of Veteran interactions as necessary to identify user interface requirements, data requirements, and potential capabilities of future COTS products (e.g., Customer Relationship Management, Knowledge Management, enterprise content management, advanced search and taxonomy management, integrated user interface tools).  The Government intends to utilize COTS products to the maximum extent possible in the future development of the production system and is employing rapid prototyping and agile development methodologies to prototype for the purpose of defining business, data and capability requirements.  The VCC Prototype shall be demonstrated to SMEs and feedback shall be documented and used to improve the model.  The contractor shall document the workflow prototype in a Business Process Model that describes the workflow, how the system was configured to simulate the workflow, how tasks were simulated and to develop user interface specifications. During prototype activities, any modifications to the prototype or demonstration configuration must be updated in a configuration description document.The Contractor will provide user interface specifications, workflow documentation and knowledge transfers through scheduled working sessions, ensuring the Government or the Government's representatives understands the business processes, data requirements and user interface system requirements, demonstration and prototyping environment, and the lessons learned. This is in addition to the documentation produced throughout the project.The period of performance is anticipated to begin in July 2010. The Government anticipates a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract. In the event VA proceeds to a formal request for proposals, VA reserves the right to consider alternative engagement models.This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.The Government is open to considering teaming and prime/subcontractor relationships for this effort.  If interested, please submit a Capabilities Statement, limited to ten (10) pages for your company, your teammates and or subcontractors and also denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511. Please include company name, company address, and DUNS Number (if applicable). Also, please indicate if you, your teammates and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or a Veteran Owned Small Business.Respondents should address the following questions: 1.	Does your company possess the capabilities to independently provide some or all of the services described above?  If not, please describe your team/subcontracting arrangements and/or approach.2.	How would your company propose providing the services?3.	Is your company currently providing similar solutions to another government agency or other non-government customer? If so, please identify the agency or non-government customer. If you are unwilling to share your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or similar services commercially (outside the federal Government.)4.	How would your company utilize agile development in the government environment? If your company is currently providing these services in the government sector, please identify the agency.Responses are requested no later than close of business on May 11th, 2010, via email to iris.farrell@va.gov and anne.vasconcelos@va.govPoint of Contacts: Anne Marie Vasconcelos, Contracting Officer, Department of Veterans Affairs Technology Acquisition Center, Phone (732) 578-5485, Email anne.vasconcelos@va.gov and Iris Farrell, Contract Specialist, Department of Veterans Affairs Technology Acquisition Center, Phone (732) 578-5476, Email iris.farrell@va.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION- Sources Sought:The Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Clinical Informatics Section, 1660 S. Columbian Way, Seattle, Washington 98108 is in the process of seeking contractors for the below:Innovations Grant #102, Applying Knowledge Management Tools to Clinical Systems Configuration, administered through the VA Puget Sound Health Care Systems Clinical Informatics Section has a requirement to provide a functional prototype system for applying knowledge management tools to VA's electronic health record's systems configurations in support of VHA's clinical mission.  The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) configuration creates the computer interface and tools used by staff in providing direct patient care and directly impacts patient safety and quality of care.  CPRS configuration in VHA varies greatly from site to site, is not based on a reproducible process or body of knowledge, and is not updated on a regular basis.  This proposal applies specific knowledge management methodologies and tools to CPRS configuration creating a knowledge asset that can be scalable across the organization.  Advocacy and maintenance of standardized lifecycle processes for VA tasks and projects shall also be provided.Amongst other steps commensurate with project management, documentation, and implementation, the contractor shall 1) provide architecture and development services to develop knowledge maps, value streams, governance statements, metrics, and other components of knowledge management to incorporate internal work processes identified by clinical, administrative, and technical stakeholders for the purpose of developing a secure, web-based knowledge management system, and 2) provide programming and development services to build a functioning web-based knowledge management system.  This system will integrate key Microsoft applications already licensed and in widespread use in VHA, including applications such as the Microsoft Office 2007  suite of applications, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS), InfoPath 2007, Structured Query Language (SQL) 2007, and Visio for organizing the development, storage, sharing, collaboration, communication, presentation, analysis, and review of order menus, progress note and report templates, clinical reminders, data objects, computed findings, clinical workflow flowcharts, and other site-configurable components of CPRS at VA Puget Sound.  The design for this solution shall be scalable by VA staff at a later date to the VISN/regional level, national VHA level, and interagency level (VA/DoD/IHS).  The selection of the applications for this project is predicated on the software being already owned and widely deployed within VA, as well as the existence of a national premier-level service contract through March 2012.  It is anticipated that updated versions of some of the applications, including Visio, will become available during the course of this project, in which case the vendor shall design the applications detailed below to take full advantage of the upgraded functionality.  It is anticipated that successful integration of these applications to achieve the desired deliverable will require the contractor to have access to source code necessary for developing custom workflows that fully integrate the currently licensed software and essential to migrating the customized system into upcoming releases of software, e.g., Microsoft Office 2010 applications.  This will also require access to Microsoft's Technology Adoption program for work with pre-release versions of applications, including VISIO 2010, so VA staff involved in the project can identify areas of impact and coordinate with the contractor regarding solutions.The Government is conducting market research to identify knowledgeable, qualified and experienced sources capable of providing the services described in this request for information.  Responses from all business categories will be accepted.It is anticipated the VA will award a 12-month Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 541512.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is $25 Million.RESPONSES:  Responses shall be submitted no later than 4:00pm EST on 6 May 2010.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement.  Interested sources may identify, in writing, their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Information submitted does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas and should include the following contractor qualifications:1.	Access to source code for Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Office 2010, Visio 2007, and Visio 2010, and other relevant Microsoft applications for the purpose of developing custom workflows that fully integrate currently licensed software and for migrating the customized system to upcoming releases of software, e.g., Microsoft Office 2010 applications.2.	Ability to offer access to Microsoft Technology Adoption program for work with pre-release versions of applications, including VISIO 2010 so VA staff involved in the project can identify areas of impact and coordinate with the contractor regarding solutions.  3.	Knowledge and experience with designing and developing complex knowledge management systems utilizing Microsoft applications.4.	Ability to provide expert-level documentation and training to VA staff to enable them to enhance, adapt, evolve, and maintain knowledge management tools developed as a result of this project.The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-10-RQ-0193 is for reference purposes only.  No solicitation is available at this time.Contracting Office Address:Department of Veterans Affairs, Technology Acquisition Center260 Industrial Way WestEatontown, NJ 07724Point of Contact:Kimberly Flynn, Contract Specialist 732-578-5442

<SUBJECT>RFI for LED Airfield Taxiway Lighting
<SOLNBR>RFI-04-10-PKY
<RESPDATE>050710
<CONTACT>Christopher Muntz, Contract Specialist, Email christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>1.0 General Information<br /><br />1.1 This is a Request For Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about pricing, delivery, and other market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the RFI respondents to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />1.2 Responses should include information identifying whether the offeror's firm is a small or large business. The size standard is 500 employees. The NAICS code for this potential effort is 335129. <br /><br />2.0 Description<br />The United States Air Force's (USAF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC) is seeking information for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certified light-emitting diode (LED) taxiway fixtures. The information would provide an enterprise-wide, continental United States (CONUS), solution for converting taxiways from quartz/incandescent fixtures to LED fixtures. The awarded company/companies would supply the LED fixture, as well as potentially manage the installation of the fixture. It is estimated that CONUS-wide there are up to 15,000 quartz/incandescent fixtures that need to be converted to LED. The period for this conversion could range multiple years, as installations obtain adequate funding.<br /><br />The ESG CECC is investigating the availability of suppliers of LED technology that will improve efficiencies in both energy and manpower, while at the same time, maintain or improve airfield operations on taxiways.<br /><br />The USAF operates approximately 46 CONUS, geographically dispersed, bases which maintain airfield taxiway lighting systems by in-house government and contract work forces. Current airfield lighting, which is typically quartz/incandescent, is inefficient in terms of energy consumption and associated costs for illumination and also has higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to the new LED alternative(s). Further, there is a higher cost for operations and maintenance associated with airfield taxiway incandescent lamps and fixtures based on their energy consumption and life expectancies. There is also the potential that LEDs could improve the situational awareness and level of guidance to the pilots since LEDs have a greater intensity, which could reduce the amount of incursions and accidents during periods of darkness and low visibility.<br /><br />In line with the Air Force's "20/20 by 2020" goal - to offset a 20% reduction in funds by achieving efficiencies and operational/spend improvements by 20% - the ESG CECC is seeking information on suppliers of this new LED technology to replace these less efficient incandescent lamps and fixtures, and to contract the work required and/or partner with the USAF to perform the installations and related electrical work on the CONUS bases, so that the Air Force can gain benefits from the modernization. <br /><br />3.0 Requested Information<br />The primary intent of this RFI is to determine the available LED taxiway fixtures and installation options that may be available to meet the Air Force's mission needs. The ESG CECC also seeks information to streamline the sourcing process and any associated training with installing/maintaining the new LEDs. <br /><br />3.1 Focus areas include but are not limited to the examples listed below: <br /><br />3.1.1 The features of your LED product in terms of energy consumption, ease of maintenance/installation, projected total cost of ownership, and compliance with FAA requirements.<br /><br />3.1.2 The ease of implementing your solution from an enterprise-wide perspective and in the required geographic scope (CONUS) for both product and installation options. <br /><br />3.1.3 Your experience with similar implementations of taxiway LED fixtures, particularly at military installations.<br /><br />3.1.4 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI by answering the list of questions attached (3.1.4.1).<br /><br />4.0 Responses<br /><br />4.1 Responses are due no later than 1 PM EST 7 May 2010. Your submittal should be limited to a maximum of 15 pages. Responses should be submitted by email to the following: <br /><br />Mr. Chris Muntz<br />email: christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil<br /><br />4.2 The submitted documentation and content thereof becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request. This is a request for information announcement for planning purposes only. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. Although proposal terminology may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the Government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.<br /><br />4.3 This notice is part of Government market research. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by page, such that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.<br /><br />5.0 Industry Discussions<br />ESG CECC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements. If the Air Force needs a clarification, the respective RFI respondent(s) will be notified.<br /><br />6.0 Questions<br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Mr. Chris Muntz, christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted, accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.<br /><br />7.0 Additional Information<br /><br />7.1 All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered by the Government Evaluation Team, depending on agency time constraints. <br /><br />7.2 All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed above.<br /><br />8.0 Summary<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. It is intended to identify potential sources that can provide alternatives for sourcing LED airfield taxiway lighting and the associated installation thereof.<br /><br />The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Air Force has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as authorization to incur costs for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-203-1493<br />Name: FOLDER, FILE COLORED STRAIGHT CUT FILE FOLDER, 11 POINT, LAVENDER<br />Description: Lavender, Letter Size, Straight-cut folder with reinforced top is made of heavyweight stock.</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9482<br />Name: FOLDER, FILE COLORED STRAIGHT CUT FILE FOLDER, 11 POINT, PINK<br />Description: Pink, Letter Size, Straight-cut folder with reinforced top is made of heavyweight stock.</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9483<br />Name: FOLDER, FILE COLORED STRAIGHT CUT FILE FOLDER, 11 POINT, PURPLE<br />Description: Purple, Letter Size, Straight-cut folder with reinforced top is made of heavyweight stock.</p>

<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9503<br />Name: FOLDER, FILE COLORED STRAIGHT CUT FILE FOLDER, 11 POINT, BROWN<br />Description: Brown, Letter Size, Straight-cut folder with reinforced top is made of heavyweight stock.</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9504<br />Name: FOLDER, FILE COLORED STRAIGHT CUT FILE FOLDER, 11 POINT, GRAY<br />Description: Gray, Letter Size, Straight-cut folder with reinforced top is made of heavyweight stock.</p>
<p><br />Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service, Office Support Center - Paper Product, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-203-1493<br />Similar Items: SMD-12410, ESS-R152LAV</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9482<br />Similar Items: SMD-12610, ESS-152PIN</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9483<br />Similar Items: None Reported</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9485<br />Similar Items: SMD-12810</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9503<br />Similar Items: None Reported</p>
<p>NSN: 7530-01-364-9504<br />Similar Items: SMD-12310, ESS-R152GRA</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 13, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the Strategic Technology Office (STO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to issue a request for proposal to Johns Hopkins University - Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL) for the Optical Modem effort. DARPA requires highly specialized research, development, and technical services under its new FOENEX effort. The Agency is looking for initial prototype FSOC elements to jointly evaluate performance with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) for field experiments. Under the baseline FOENEX effort, JHU-APL will provide up to 8 FSO terminals with advanced Optical Modems, up to 4 hybrid FSO/RF network routers and node controllers, and related equipment for integration into as many as 3 airborne and a single ground host platform for field testing. Based on customer input, an option(s) will be included to add up to 8 high-data-rate RF terminals and associated interconnecting components to enable the full hybrid FSO/RF networking capability with the baseline 8 FSO terminals. The effort also includes the ancillary activities for training, field support, and engineering analysis. JHU-APL will research, develop, and demonstrate an advanced prototype FOENEX system that operates on large aircraft, such as the Navy P-3 aircraft, at altitudes up to 25,000 feet, and distances up to 200 km air-to- air and 50 km air-to-ground, with nominal FSOC and RF data rates of 10 Gigabit per second (Gbps) and 270 Megabit per second (Mbps), respectively, and near-perfect reliability and error-free operations. JHU-APL is the only known source in the case of a follow-on requirement with the in-depth knowledge and experience with the Optical Modems and end-to-end system requirements. The Optical Modem, which includes an Optical Automatic Gain Control (OAGC) and Forward Error Correction, is the key subsystem for compensating for large channel fading (up to a factor of 10,000) to yield error-free 10 Gbps data rate under high atmospheric turbulent conditions. Its integration with Free-Space Optical (FSO) and Radio Frequency (RF) communications terminals and stochastic network routers, will allow the demonstration of highly reliable, robust, and high data rate hybrid FSO/RF communications among space, airborne and ground platforms. In this effort, JHU-APL will leverage the experience gained supporting the DARPA Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) program that resulted from full and open competition under DARPA-BAA-07-55, as well as in several predecessor optical communications initiatives. The integrated system will be evaluated in a field environment like the Nevada Testing and Training Range (NTTR), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), or some similar location. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. Point of contact for this synopsis is Contracting Officer; Robin Swatloski; SN10-45@darpa.mil. See Note 22.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-10-32 STRUCTURAL LOGIC PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE
<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference in support of the DARPA BAA10-54, Structural Logic program on May 7, 2010 at from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, in the Booz Allen Hamilton offices located at 3811 N Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Structural Logic program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for Structural Logic program with the objective to develop and demonstrate adaptive, high performance structural systems. As the demands on military platforms and buildings increase, so does the need for structures that can mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments. Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve only extreme stiffness. The Structural Logic program seeks to enable structural systems that adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping. By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and adaptive dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms, and buildings with the ability to continually change their properties to match the demands of an ever evolving environment.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register no later than close of business (5:00 PM ET) May 6, 2010, at the following website: https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=DAR79019 Conference Code: DAR79019. Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website. There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations at the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 70 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization. The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public. All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event. US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference. Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request".

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 4275 contiguous net usable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 51 North First Street, Ellendale, North Dakota 58436.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location.  The space must be available for occupancy on or before January 1, 2010.

North- 96th Street SE

Other applicable requirements include:	
- Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
- Parking  28 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)

<SUBJECT>Accelerating Adoption of Assistive Technologies to Reduce Physical Strain among Family Caregivers of the Chronically Disabled Elderly Living at Home
<SOLNBR>10-233-SOL-00150
<ARCHDATE>04302010
<CONTACT>Matthew Gormley, Phone 301.443.7814, Email Matthew.Gormley@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This opportunity is available only to Program Support Center PSC Task Order Holders.

This is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) procurement.  Pursuant to FAR 52.204-11, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  Reporting Requirements (MAR 2009), the Contractor is required to register by July 1, 2010 and file their first report by July 10, 2010 at www.federalreporting.gov .

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation intends to issue one task order under the PSC Task Orders. The main objective of this project is to accelerate adoption of assistive technologies to mitigate high family caregiver stress associated physical strain of providing personal assistance with daily living tasks (e.g. help with bathing, toileting, transferring)  to chronically disabled elders living at home.  There are two components to the project:  The research component involves a systematic review of the evidence-base related to the role of assistive technologies in preventing overexertion and injuries among paid long-term care workers and the implications for unpaid family caregivers.  The adoption component involves (1) consultation with experts on assistive technology and experts on family caregiving for the elderly as well as (2) site visits (in person and/or telephonic) to the local programs that operate under the umbrella of the Older Americans Act-funded National Family Caregiver Support Program.  The purpose is to gain a better understanding of what these programs currently do or could do to facilitate family caregivers access to appropriate assistive technologies (those identified by the research component). The end product is to be a report including recommendations how to maximize the potential of the NFCSP as a vehicle for accelerating adoption of assistive technologies to reduce the physical strain experienced by family caregivers of the non-institutionalized frail elderly.    
The task order is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 from the Office of the Secretary Comparative Effectiveness Research Funds.

The period of performance of the resultant task order will be for 18 months from the date of award.
The RFQ will be issued to the PSC Task Order Holders on or about April 29, 2010.
The RFQ closing date is May 21, 2010.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA: DCA200-81-H-0014-TF10. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

(a) Method of payment. 
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractors EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.<BR><BR>(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractors EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for 
(i) Making a correct payment; 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractors EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.<BR><BR>h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractors financial agent. 
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. 
(End of clause)<BR><BR>52.203-5  Covenant Against Contingent Fees. As prescribed in 3.404, insert the following clause: 
Covenant Against Contingent Fees (Apr 1984) 
(a) The Contractor warrants that no person or agency has been employed or retained to solicit or obtain this contract upon an agreement or understanding for a contingent fee, except a bona fide employee or agency. For breach or violation of this warranty, the Government shall have the right to annul this contract without liability or, in its discretion, to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of the contingent fee. 
(b) Bona fide agency, as used in this clause, means an established commercial or selling agency, maintained by a contractor for the purpose of securing business, that neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds itself out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.

<CONTACT>Teresa Corse, Phone 814-728-6288, Email teresacorse@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service has a requirement for a two-phase design build marina dock project at the Allegheny National Forest located on the Bradford Ranger District, Kinzua-Wolf Marina, Mead Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania.  The Marina is located on the Allegheny Reservoir (Kinzua Dam) on Route 59 East approximately 12 miles from Warren, PA.  After crossing the Morrison Bridge on Route 59 the Marina is located on the left.

The Marina has undergone extensive renovations in the past few years that include new docks, upgrading the water and electrical systems, construction of a handicap ACC fishing trail and paving of the parking lots.  Currently the marina has 206 slips for boats.

The Allegheny Reservoir is a flood controlled reservoir, maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers.  The water elevation varies throughout the year.  Normal elevation during boating season is 1328 feet with expected operating levels varying from 1318 to 1335 feet.

The existing dock system is a floating dock system comprised of smaller dock sections and variable sized fingers.  The docks are made of high-density molecular polyethylene and filled with expanded polystyrene (EPS).  The floatation units are bolted to the structure with bolt and nut assemblies and spaced to provide the desired buoyancy.  The decking is a non-structural component Composite Hardwood material and the fenders are made of black molded polyethylene fender and are installed at each finger dock.  Access to the docks is provided by three 60 gangways (Docks A, B & E) and one 80 ADA accessible gangway at dock H.  Dock H was designed to offer extra protection to the other docks from wind and waves, but each dock is secured into place with winches and steel cables tethered to concrete anchors resting on the reservoirs bottom.  This winch/cable system allows for the docks to be adjusted for varying water levels.

The marina docks provide a number of varied services to boaters including water spigots, a supply shack, gas pump and coin operated sewage pump.  The water and electric are provided to the complex by new and updated facilities on the shore. 

Water is provided to the docks (E & H), a new water fountain along the shore, the toilet building and the bait shop through newly installed water lines. Two wells serve the marina; one feeds the restaurant and the other pumps to a storage tank by the tree line near Route 59. The storage tank gravity feeds all the lines to the docks and the shoreline facilities. Drain lines are located at various points on the line to winterize the system.

Electric is fed from the new Penelec Transformer to both the upgraded existing panel board and the new panel board. The new panel board provides electricity to the docks including Dock Marine Power & Lighting Lighthouse Pedestals, Safety Pedestals, Bender Ground Fault Monitor & Spares. The upgraded existing electrical panel provides electricity to the Bait Shop, Well Pump & Pump Shutoff, Gas pumps, Light Poles, Low Level Alarm & Chlorine Injector Pump. 

All of the docks are equipped with safety measures including pedestals that contain fire extinguishers, life rings and a warning light and alarm. The water system is protected from contamination; stainless steel screens on all drain lines and an RPZD backflow preventer on each waterline near the sewer pumpout. Additional safety is provided by the Bender ground fault monitor which measures electrical current leaks into the water.

Project Scope

The proposed contract includes the design and construction of a new floating dock system utilizing the existing bulkhead at the far west end of the marina.  The work includes, but is not limited to, evaluating the bulkhead for structural stability, installation of new conduits and circuits for the electrical supply system and extensions to the existing water supply system to provide service to the new dock.  Work incorporates the full range of design, fabrication, construction and installation services necessary to achieve a fully functioning system.
The design of the floating dock system is to be completed for possible future use and extension up to 550 feet, including the gangway.  It is anticipated that due to budget constraints, that it may not be possible to purchase and install the entire designed dock system under the base contract. The installation of the dock system will allow for as many slips as possible to be constructed in accordance with the funding available.

The phase one portion of this two-phase design build project is to initially evaluate offerors qualifications to determine their capability to perform the project.  The highest rated offerors from Phase One (a total of 5 top rated firms will be chosen) will be furnished a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Phase Two portion and asked to submit technical proposals and pricing.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate with any or all offerors or award without discussion on the Phase Two solicitation portion of this requirement to the offeror submitting the best value proposal.  Cost for submission of price and technical proposals will not be compensated.

The Phase One evaluation criteria that firms are to address in their proposal is:  1) Technical Approach (but does not include a detailed design or specific technical information on the actual design). 2) Specialized Experience to include the offeror(s) past dock system design and construction experiences on similar projects completed over the past five years.  Experience is relevant when the offeror has been confronted with the kinds of work or challenges that will be present under the contract contemplated.  The offeror will be assessed by the relevant experience on the basis of its breadth and its depth.  For each relevant contract or reference, the offeror shall provide (a) name and location of the project; (b) Contact name and phone number of customer or their agent; (c) whether the offeror was the prime contractor or a subcontractor; (d) list of subcontractors and suppliers used; (e) brief description of project and work performed; (f) dollar values of the projects.  3) Technical competence, offeror shall demonstrate and discuss their technical competence and ability to perform this project.  4) Capability to Perform.  Offeror shall discuss their capacity, available personnel and other areas to demonstrate their capability to perform this project.  5) Past Performance of the offerors team (including the architect-engineer and construction members).  Past performance is relevant when the offeror has satisfied performance factors with customers in the past and complied with Federal, State, and Local Laws and Regulations.  The assessment of past performance will be subjective and based mainly on the offerors reputation with their customers and others.  References will be contacted for information regarding their opinion on the following: (a) capability, efficiency and effectiveness; (b) performance conformed to the terms and conditions of the contract; (c) reasonableness and cooperation during performance; (d) commitment to quality work and timely completion.  Offerors with no past performance will be rated as Neutral in this category and not necessarily be rejected.  The Forest Service reserves the right to contact references other than those provided by offeror for rating Past Performance.

The highest five rated offerors from Phase One will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  The competitive range will not exceed five unless the Contracting Officer determines that a number greater than five is in the governments best interest.  The Government will notify those offerors that did not make the competitive range and will not be considered for further evaluations.

STATEMENT OF WORK:

RADIANT PANEL TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM
Building 216  Room G115
BACKGROUND:
The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a new organization that, as part of its operations, maintains a shared use facility for measurements to support the development of nanotechnology.  In addition to a fully equipped nanofabrication laboratory, the center includes a number of state-of-the-art analytical tools.  The Center also has an active research program in various areas of nanotechnology and develops instrumentation beyond the state-of-the-art in support of those activities.  The Center has recently acquired two state-of-the-art transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) that will enable us to support both the user facility and research program.  We are currently in the process of constructing a dedicated microscope suite to house these instruments.  

In order to obtain the optimum performance from these instruments, very stringent control of the room environment around each microscope is required:  temperature, humidity, air-flow, acoustic vibrations, electrical and magnetic fields must all be maintained within tight tolerances.  We seek a ceiling-mounted radiant cooling panel system to provide the necessary temperature control inside the microscope suite. The system should be capable of meeting the temperature control requirements specified in this document without adversely affecting the acoustic, air-flow, electrical and magnetic field levels in the rooms.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the design, fabrication and installation of the system.
 
SUMMARY:
Items to be designed, furnished and installed include; a multi zone ceiling mounted radiant cooling system, complete with its dedicated water-cooled chillers, radiant cooling panels and hanging support devices, piping controls and accessories. The end result shall be a turnkey system where the supplier is responsible for the design, procurement and fabrication of the entire system, its parts and components and field installation, startup and commissioning.  

Interested parties are encouraged to inspect the site before submitting proposals (See Site Visit).

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors:

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are more important than price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements/Salient Characteristics. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past 5 years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Past Performance Information, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. 

Price:  The government shall evaluate price for reasonableness.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-154-RSF and is being issued as a Request for Quote. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-40. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The National Institute Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement for three (3) Illumina-HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 DNA Analysis Kit (48) brand name or equal. 

Each HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 DNA Analysis Bead Chip can process twelve samples and analyze >700,000 loci. Each package contains four Bead Chips, along with reagents for amplifying, fragmenting, hybridizing, labeling and detecting 48 DNA samples. Each BeadChip features over one million available assays per sample, containing carefully selected markers that deliver dense genome-wide coverage. Intelligent tag SNP selection has been optimized to maintain comprehensive genomic coverage, while reducing tag SNP redundancy. This has enabled the inclusion of additional content carefully chosen to target high-value regions of the genome associated with human disease. 

This newly designed chip permits processing of 12 patients per chip and allows SNP based genotyping. SNP based genotyping to identify a disease gene is a specialized technology requiring specific instrumentation and expertise. NHGRI has access to Illumina Instrumentation and the expertise in this technology through NHGRI collaborators.  The analysis bead cheap to be purchased will be used in conjunction with previously purchased software. This software is used to conduct the analysis of data. NHGRI has customized a computer to run the program using this software and the bead chip.  Additionally, NHGRI has also written programs for the analysis and presentation of the output. Offerings from other manufacturers are not compatible with the existing setup. As such it would not be technically practical or cost efficient to move to a new system.

It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial ItemsNOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  
(i)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM(ii)	ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE AND FOB TERMS(iii)	PAST PERFORMANCE(iv)	PRICE
(b)  Ability to meet both (i) technical capability to perform and (ii) ability to meet the required delivery schedule and FOB terms represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically acceptable to be performing under Factors (i) and (ii) will be further evaluated under Factors (iii) and (iv).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) and (ii) to be technically acceptable, Factor (iii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iv), PRICE.  
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from a price, delivery and technical standpoint.   
(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  
(d) The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is shown in herein.  FOB terms are shown in herein.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  
(e) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM and ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE AND FOB TERMS represents the MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under these factors, offers will be determined to be either acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined acceptable under these factors will render the offer unacceptable and not considered for award.  
(f)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior same and/or similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(g)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE 


Purpose:
The purpose of this contract is to acquire professional services to build upon the research and evaluation work done as part of a literature review.  The following is a description of activities and tasks required to expand and continue the efforts of the Environmental Scan contract in support of the Office on Womens Health website programs.  These tasks include information gathering and evaluation as well as conducting focus groups and usability testing on the womenshealth.gov website.
						
Background:
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Womens Health (OWH) is in the process of reviewing the performance and design of its two websites, www.womenshealth.gov and www.girlshealth.gov.  The womens health website (then called 4woman.gov) was launched in November 1998.  The girls health website (then called 4girls.gov) was launched in July 2002.  In 2009,  OWH contracted the performance of a literature review and environmental scan to help OWH gain an understanding of what reliable, science-based, health information is available for its target populations, what the key competition for the www.womenshealth.gov and www.girlshealth.gov website is, and what the pattern of use is for those competitor sites.  OWH now seeks to build upon the understanding gained through the literature review and evaluation and gain insight as to what health issues its target audiences are facing, and where they are going to find answers.  This will be accomplished through focus groups, and informational interviews.  OWH also seeks to gain an understanding of what aspects of womenshealth.gov are functioning well for its target audiences.  This will be accomplished through a series of usability testing on the womenshealth.gov website.

Statement of Work:
The contractor shall work with the Office on Womens Health to complete the work outlined in this statement of work.  The statement of work for this contract details tasks in support of ongoing improvements to www.womenshealth.gov

Task 1: Gather and Review Existing Materials
1.1	Determine sites content goals, prioritize target audiences, and desired HHS messaging. 
1.2	Gather and evaluate ForeSee results (including open text remarks), past usability test results on the womenshealth.gov site, web site traffic reports (top pages, bounce rates, referring sites/search engines, site search terms), and any additional supporting data. 
1.3	Identify gaps in research as well as areas to further explore in the focus groups and user interviews. 
1.4	Develop content inventory for the existing website.

Task 2: Develop Research Questions

2.1   Based on identification and prioritization of target audiences, develop focus group questions as well as approach to usability analysis on recently designed wireframes. 

Task 3: Recruit for and Conduct Research 

3.1 Recruit consumers (not necessarily users): segmented by age, with ethnic diversity; focus groups and individual interviews. Recommended age segmentation: 
o	18 to 24

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 200540 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20100408. The proposed acquisition is restricted to small businesses. The associated NAICS code is 611699 with a standard business size of $7.0 million. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated. Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure: 

CLIN 0001: Technical Support Services

Offers shall depict each labor category, quantity per category, and hourly rate/daily required to provide the requested services. Technical support services that are classified as open market services in lieu of GSA services shall be clearly identified. All work will be done in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) attached.

Delivery: Period of performance will begin May 31, 2010 and end no later than June 11, 2010.

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are price, technical (technical approach, understanding the requirement, technical plan/methodology), delivery date, relevant (similar services provided within the past three years) and satisfactory past performance, and price.  Categorically, evaluation factors will be weighed in this order of precedence; technical, delivery date, and past performance. The Government intends to make award based on lowest price technically acceptable. 

Standard Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Language

-	Use of LPTA is required by AI 13.106-100.
-	LPTA may not be appropriate for use where high quality is required and that factor can not otherwise be reduced to an acceptable/non-acceptable factor under an LPTA analysis (i.e. it is generally appropriate for simple products or services).

52.212-2 Evaluation  Commercial Items. (select appropriate bold language below)

a.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, the most advantageous offer for the government will be the responsible, lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror considering the following factors:

[Choose from among the following factors; choose fewer if acquisition is for a simple product or service and we need to award quickly; the following list is not all-inclusive.]

1. Price; [mandatory]
2. Delivery; 
3. Technical; 
4. Past Performance; [Past performance is only valuable if we get relevant and recent past performance information.  This must be explained to vendors  e.g. Submit past performance references from three or more customers for projects /services performed within the last three years that were for the same or similar items or services described in this solicitation.  We can consider a shorter period of time if there are numerous actions or many vendors providing the required items.  If a contractor has no experience then you don't hold that against them - they receive a neutral rating which is acceptable.  They are not acceptable if they have had negative past performance.  Personal knowledge of the contracting officer MAY be considered.]
5.  Experience; [Similar to past performance but a distinct factor; it represents the experience they have in the industry, and not necessarily how they have performed on previous contracts; the solicitation should say what minimum level experience is required IOT be acceptable, e.g., 3 yrs direct or related experience.] 
6.  Management/Personnel; [If this is a factor we want to consider, the solicitation must list the requirements for management or personnel so that the offer will know what is acceptable.] 

Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will then make award to the lowest priced of the technically acceptable vendors. 

OR
 
Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will select the vendor whose quote is the lowest price of the technically acceptable quotes in order to negotiate details.  If agreement can not be reached with that vendor, the Government will move on to the next lowest priced, technically acceptable vendor.   

[If applicable, add the following]  While not a factor for determination of technical acceptability, contractors are reminded that this solicitation contains (DFARS 252.225-7024, Requirement for Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan) OR (DFARS 252.225-7026, Acquisition Restricted to Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan).  In order to receive consideration for award under this solicitation, offerors must comply with this clause.  

b. Options  use appropriate language from 52.212-2

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-  (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and      (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (1) Listed end products.Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin     (2) Certification.

It is suggested you provide a pre-addressed stamp envelop to former clients for their use in submitting their Performance Questionnaire. See section Past Performance References for additional information. <BR>       Offerors are advised that the Government may use all data provided by the offeror in this quote and data obtained from other sources, to include but not limited to Governmentwide databases, in the development of performance assessments.  While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete Past Performance information rests with the offeror. <BR><BR>One award will be made to the qualified offeror deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose quote conforms to all the synopsis/solicitation requirements and is judged to represent the Best Value to the Government.  This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror; where the Contracting Officer determines that the Past Performance of the higher-priced offeror outweighs the cost difference.  To arrive at a Best Value decision this acquisition will utilize the FAR Part 13.106-2 evaluation of quotations or offers.<BR><BR>Past Performance Evaluation:  The past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offerors ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance record under existing and prior contracts over the past three years for similar services. The government will evaluate the offerors demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet users needs, including cost and schedule. General trends in the Contractors performance will be considered. <BR>   The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of this synopsis/solicitation. Emphasis will be placed on recent, relevant experience. The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained. A relevancy determination of the offerors present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its subcontractors or teaming partners involvement) will be made. The Government is not bound by the offerors opinion of relevancy. <BR>   The Government may consider an offerors contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offerors present and past performance lend itself to this approach. For example, an offerors work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort. However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort. The following relevancy criteria apply: <BR>       VERY RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities, which are essentially what this solicitation requires. <BR>       RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       NOT RELEVANT: Did not involve any significant aspects of above. <BR>   In assessing present and past performance an overall confidence assessment rating will be made. The following performance confidence assessment ratings apply: <BR>Rating Definition <BR>High Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has high confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Significant Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has significant confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal Contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. <BR>Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). <BR>Little Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>No Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>   <BR>Price Evaluation:  The price quote shall initially be reviewed for compliance with the synopsis/solicitation. The Contracting Officer may complete the compliance review prior to the evaluation of Past Performance and offers that fail to meet the compliance requirements will not be evaluated and will be eliminated from the competition.  The purpose of the Price evaluation is to provide an assessment of the reasonableness and realism of the proposed price/cost in relation to the solicitation requirements. Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner:  Reasonableness will be determined IAW FAR 13.106-3. <BR>   A Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The Total Evaluated Price will be formulated as follows: <BR>       For CLIN 0001- CLIN 0015 the Contracting Officer shall add the total prices together to develop the TEP.<BR>       Offerors are cautioned against submitting a quote that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more schedule items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced. <BR><BR>FAR 52.212-3 (Alt 1), Offerors Representations and Certifications, Commercial Items (Offerors shall include a completed copy as part of their quote or a completed registration on the ORCA website (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx), 52.212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders with the following clauses incorporated 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, 52.233-3 Protest after Award, 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim, 52.203-6 Alt.

It is suggested you provide a pre-addressed stamp envelop to former clients for their use in submitting their Performance Questionnaire. See section Past Performance References for additional information. <BR>       Offerors are advised that the Government may use all data provided by the offeror in this quote and data obtained from other sources, to include but not limited to Governmentwide databases, in the development of performance assessments.  While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete Past Performance information rests with the offeror. <BR><BR>One award will be made to the qualified offeror deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose quote conforms to all the synopsis/solicitation requirements and is judged to represent the Best Value to the Government.  This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror; where the Contracting Officer determines that the Past Performance of the higher-priced offeror outweighs the cost difference.  To arrive at a Best Value decision this acquisition will utilize the FAR Part 13.106-2 evaluation of quotations or offers.<BR><BR>Past Performance Evaluation:  The past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offerors ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance record under existing and prior contracts over the past three years for similar services. The government will evaluate the offerors demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet users needs, including cost and schedule. General trends in the Contractors performance will be considered. <BR>   The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of this synopsis/solicitation. Emphasis will be placed on recent, relevant experience. The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained. A relevancy determination of the offerors present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its subcontractors or teaming partners involvement) will be made. The Government is not bound by the offerors opinion of relevancy. <BR>   The Government may consider an offerors contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offerors present and past performance lend itself to this approach. For example, an offerors work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort. However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort. The following relevancy criteria apply: <BR>       VERY RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities, which are essentially what this solicitation requires. <BR>       RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       NOT RELEVANT: Did not involve any significant aspects of above. <BR>   In assessing present and past performance an overall confidence assessment rating will be made. The following performance confidence assessment ratings apply: <BR>Rating Definition <BR>High Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has high confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Significant Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has significant confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal Contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. <BR>Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). <BR>Little Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>No Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>   <BR>Price Evaluation:  The price quote shall initially be reviewed for compliance with the synopsis/solicitation. The Contracting Officer may complete the compliance review prior to the evaluation of Past Performance and offers that fail to meet the compliance requirements will not be evaluated and will be eliminated from the competition.  The purpose of the Price evaluation is to provide an assessment of the reasonableness and realism of the proposed price/cost in relation to the solicitation requirements. Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner:  Reasonableness will be determined IAW FAR 13.106-3. <BR>   A Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The Total Evaluated Price will be formulated as follows: <BR>       For CLIN 0001- CLIN 0015 the Contracting Officer shall add the total prices together to develop the TEP.<BR>       Offerors are cautioned against submitting a quote that contains unbalanced pricing.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army, Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems (OPM-MAS), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking sources for the manufacture and delivery of 5.56mm, M995 Armor Piercing (AP) DODICs and 7.62mm, M993 AP DODICs in the configurations described in the specifications section of this notice.  Purchasing by DODICs (Department of Defense Identification Code), or packing configurations, will require sources to provide AP cartridges, tracer cartridges, and all necessary packaging materials to meet the final packed-out configuration.  The AP cartridges shall provide enhanced penetration capabilities against lightly armored vehicles. The 5.56mm M995 AP cartridges will be used in the M16A2 Rifle, M249 SAW machine gun, and the M4 Carbine. The 7.62mm M993 cartridges will be used in the M240/M240B and the M24 Sniper Rifle. M995 cartridges and M993 cartridges will be procured in accordance with the US Government performance specifications for the M995 and M993. Since final packaging configurations will be required, contractors will be required to produce/obtain necessary tracer cartridges, links, and all packaging materials.  (These materials will not be provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM).)  Tracer cartridges and links will be purchased according to US Government Technical Data Packages (TDPs) and detail specifications.


Specifications: Only those sources with AP cartridge designs that fully conform to all the requirements of the Design Verification section of the performance specification(s) shall be considered for award. Interested sources without a previously verified design will be responsible to verify their cartridge design in accordance with the performance specification at their own expense. Upon completion of design verification testing, the Government shall review the results and will determine if the design has met the requirements and was tested in compliance with the specification. Based on this evaluation, the Government will determine if the design can be considered verified or not. Only those designs determined to be verified by the Government will be eligible for award. In order to be eligible for award, all verification efforts and results shall be complete by the close of the solicitation and provided with the proposal.  With regard to tracer cartridges and links, the Government seeks these items only from sources who are already able to produce them in accordance with US Government TDPs by the close of the solicitation.  Proof of compliance with this requirement will be required in all proposals also.  The configurations in which the Government seeks 5.56mm M995 AP cartridges have the following National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and DODICs: 1305-01-393-7050 (AA01), 1305-01-393-7052 (AA02), and 1305-01-493-3632 (AA69). The NSNs the Government seeks for 7.62mm M993 AP cartridges are: 1305-01-398-1449 (AA04), 1305-01-398-1450 (AA03), 1305-01-458-6826 (AA34), 1305-01-458-6825 (AA35), and 1305-01-458-6823 (AA36). For this procurement the contractor will be responsible for assembling the rounds into the final DODIC/NALC configuration to include all necessary tracer cartridges (i.e. M856, M62, M276, etc.), links (i.e. M27, M13, etc.), and packaging materials, so the ammunition is ready for issue to the user. Copies of the M995 and M993 performance specification are available upon request (contact information is given below). 


Planned Acquisition: A five (5) year (FY11-FY15) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) systems contract is contemplated for this effort. The estimated quantity for both the M995 and M993 is 0-10M each per Fiscal Year. 


Submission Information: All responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities along with M995 and M993 verification status with regard to the above, no later than 30 days from the initial publication of this notice to: Commander, U.S. Army ATTN: Bradley Borek, Bldg. 10 Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or at bradley.borek@us.army.mil. Please include company name, address, telephone number, and technical point of contact, and brochures/literature. Firms interested in supplying the AP ammunition should adequately describe their experience in small caliber production and testing, systems contracting, demonstrated high rate production, annual production capacity, and verification status of their proposed design. Those sources not having previously verified designs should also submit a rough outline of their plans and schedule to verify their design and shall submit any backup data to support claims that their design will conform to the performance specification requirements. Those contractors interested in the system integrator aspect of this announcement shall provide all pertinent information related to the ability to execute the effort. Firms shall provide verification status of the AP ammunition cartridges that will be supplied under this contract. Past experience and abilities of the supplier of the identified tracer ammunition and links shall be provided. In addition, the ability and past experience related to acting as a prime contractor to procure, assemble, package, and ship the necessary components shall be provided. 


THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. Electronic submittals are preferred.

This Justification and Approval(J&A) is for procurement of Blank Smart Card 330 with Artwork on a brand name onlybasis.
(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. Blank Smart Cards for continued use in support of the Department's PKI program. (3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): The State Department PKI program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise will prove non-functional in this configuration. Other smart cards have been tested and have been found to be non-compatible with the current PKIIBLADE configuration. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. IRM/OPS/ITIISI requires SafeNet Smartcard 330's to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(l), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions will have the following issues: &#19968;.	1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations &#19968;.	2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 	Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take t remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. PKVI3LADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet. Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution.

<a href="mailto:zachary.tevis@us.army.mil">USPFO for Wisconsin</a>
<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project. POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ZACHARY R. TEVIS. SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO: zachary.tevis@us.army.mil. The NAICS code is 541330 Engineering Services. The size standard is $4.5 Million. This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236. This announcement is being issued on an unrestricted basis and is for the selection of an Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Firm for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the State of Wisconsin (Wisconsin Air National Guard / Wisconsin Army National Guard). Firms must be capable of concurrently responding to and working on multiple projects simultaneously. The selection of a Firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria. All Firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest; and FAR 36.209 Construction contracts with architect-engineer firms. Large Firms, if selected, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS subpart 219.7 as part of any Request for Proposal package. The subcontracting plan is NOT required with the Firms SF 330.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF SERVICES: The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Wisconsin intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price performance based Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the State of Wisconsin (Wisconsin Air National Guard / Wisconsin Army National Guard). The A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods. A contract minimum of $1,000 and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of the contract with no limit on individual Task order amounts. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contract. The Government anticipates that this announcement will result in the award of one contract to provide services to each of three (3) primary locations: (General Mitchell International Airport, Milwaukee, WI; Truax Field, Madison, WI; Volk Field Air National Guard Base, Camp Douglas, WI); in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis. Accordingly, the contract will cover the primary locations but may also result in the issuance of task orders for locations/activities throughout the State of Wisconsin. By making a submission pursuant to this announcement, the submitting Firm acknowledges that task orders may be issued for all National Guard locations throughout the State of Wisconsin. The A-E IDIQ contract anticipated to be awarded will encompass an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods. Individual Task Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include services under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Task Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Task Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g). Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals. <BR><BR>EVALUATION: The Governments selection of the best value contractor is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s). Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services) evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team. Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team. The key positions should include: Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors. Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES. FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s). FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years) evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules. FACTOR 4 Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time) evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods. FACTOR 5 Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to Madison, WI and knowledge of the identified locality) evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract. FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months) in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement. FACTOR 7 Small Business Participation evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner. FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL. FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal. Relative to FACTOR 5 Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR><BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT: Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission. Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B. A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/. If a submitting Firm is located outside the United States, the local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted. Relative to all submittals, FONT SIZE shall be at least 10 point or larger (MS Word Font Size 10 for Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New fonts are examples of the minimum acceptable Font Size). Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches. Where page limits are indicated for Parts/Sections of the SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered. Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page. Blank sheets or tabs separating the sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation. The Organizational Chart required in Section D and the Matrix required as Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches. If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location. All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D. Resumes in Section E shall not exceed two (2) pages each. Multiple Resumes may be reflected on a single page. Resumes shall be provided for the qualified professional personnel indicated in FACTOR 1, above. Professional licenses, registrations, and/or certifications shall be specifically identified on resumes and the failure to indentify a license, registration and/or certification will result in a presumption that none exists for the individual for whom the Resume is offered. A maximum of Ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed in Section F. No more than one (1) page should be used for each project. Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page. When listing projects in Section F, an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) with multiple Task Orders as examples is not considered a project. Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project; however, listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project. A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project. In Block G-26, along with the name, include the firm with which the person is associated. Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended. An SF 330 PART II is required for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any Subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract. <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

Contracting Zachary Tevis, 1 Williams Street, Camp Douglas, WI 54618-5002. <BR><BR>Questions and Answers:<BR><BR>1.	Could you send me the latest SF 330?  Copy and Paste the following link into your browser:  http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?viewType=DETAIL&formId=21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6<BR><BR>2.	I am inquiring about the above mentioned Solicitation.  I see the Code is for Engineering Services so I assume this is to be lead by an Engineering firm.  I just simply picked the Engineering NAICS code for the announcement.  Efforts can be lead by either Architect or Engineering firms or both. <BR>3.	Also, is there a current incumbant to the IDIQ?  If so, could you let me know the firm(s)?  We currently have two IDIQ contracts for A&E services.  The firms are 1) Short Elliot Hendrickson and 2) Mead & Hunt.<BR>4.	We are wondering if you can reveal if this is a re-issue of a current contract and who (firm name) that has the current contract?  The resulting contract is intended to replace a contract presently with Mead & Hunt currently in its last option year.<BR>5.	Are there any other companies that have A-E services IDIQ contracts for the WI Nat Guard (through US PFO)?  I believe the US PFO had solicitated a similar contract about 3 years ago?  Was that ever awarded?  Yes, W912J2-08-D-0002, Short Elliot Hendrickson<BR>6.	Do you require that all team members representing each design discipline be registered in the State of Wisconsin?  Yes.  Team members need to be registered in the State of Wisconsin prior to any work against the resulting contract.  Our intention is to find the most highly qualified firm.  Registration in Wisconsin and familiarity with the State of Wisconsin is a consideration.<BR>7.	If this project is not considered a new requirement;<BR><BR>a. Who is the incumbent?  Mead & Hunt<BR><BR>b. What is the contract number?  W912J2-05-D-0001<BR><BR><BR>

C.	TECHNICAL CONTENT
1.0 Background.  The DoD is interested in systems, concepts and technologies for the detection, classification, tracking and harbor/port security against Self Propelled Semi Submersibles (SPSS) and GoFast Boats used for illicit trafficking.  The overall objective of this effort is to develop detection, classification and tracking capabilities for vehicles used to transport illicit cargo on or under the water or that could have potential to provide harm to ports and harbors. Targets of interest operate in riverine, littoral and deep water environments.  There may be large amounts of other shipping and vessel traffic in the area (i.e. high clutter environment).  The search area may be very large area (>2000nmi2).   Systems and technologies can be stand alone or they maybe used in conjunction with or networked with other systems.  The systems and technologies must be able to be used in conjunction with existing Navy and DoD sensor systems, and command and control systems.  It is preferred that the sensor data be provided directly to existing command and control systems and not routed to another location prior to being sent to the existing command and control systems..  The detection, classification and tracking capability may be integrated into existing sensor systems and command and control systems. The evaluations will also allow us to identify technical avenues for future improvements to detection, classification and tracking sensor systems.  The goal is to develop a sensor system that will allow military forces to acoustically (or by other means) monitor long stretches of territory at a standoff range with minimal personnel and to automatically detect, classify and track and alert minimally-trained operators to vehicle movement.
2.0 Goals of the systems, concepts and technologies is for the detection, classification, tracking and harbor/port security against Self Propelled Semi Submersibles (SPSS) and GoFast Boats used for illicit trafficking.  NUWC will lead the technical team, which includes participation by users from USSOUTHCOM and JIATIF-S to perform the work in a three phase approach:  
.	Phase I:  Develop CONOP(s) and technical requirements for technology/sensor system 
.	Phase II:  Evaluate the technology/system performance 
.	Phase III:  Demonstrate the sensor/system/technology capability with an in-water test.   
3.0 Scope of the Requirements.  The scope of this BAA includes sensing system technology development and demonstration.  It may include, but not be limited to:
-	Sensing systems (desired attributes) (acoustic and non-acoustic)?	One or more arrays and interrogators ?	High sensitivity low noise sensors?	Multiple sensing zones?	Scalability to large parameters/areas?	Low false alarm probability?	High probability of detection?	User interface-	Alarm notification-	GIS map based display?	Detection classification localization capability?	Multiple intruder/ incursions simultaneously?	Environmental adaptation?	Real time/Near real time updating of zone information-	Alternative sensor architectures-	Engineering analysis, and modeling and simulation-	Bread boarding, brass boarding or prototyping  for testing-	Hardware fabrication-	Software development-	Integration and testing-	Laboratory demonstration-	In-situ demonstration-	Manned and Unmanned vehicles-	Air-	Surface-	UnderwaterCommunication systemsDistributed systems/sensorsNetworked systems/sensorsBuoysFixed sensorsBottom sensors
Deliverables: CONOPS; test plans; performance parameters for sensors, signal processing requirements and algorithms, and user interface components; demonstrations; test reports; recommendations for future technical improvements.

<DESC>This Pre-Solicitation Notice changes the project name and proposed solicitation posting date while clarifying elements of the proposed work.<BR><BR>The general scope of work consists of, but is not limited to, conducting repair of erosion of the Harry S. Truman Dam stilling basin floor by placing a concrete overlay over the erosion, anchoring it to bedrock to resist uplift, and using drains to relieve upward pressure. The overlay must be placed under approximately 48 feet of water as dewatering the stilling basin is not an option. The concrete overlay will cover the full width of the stilling basin (approx. 181 feet) and extend approx. 60 feet downstream. The overlay thickness will range from about four feet to about seven feet thick and will depend on the depth of erosion, with a total volume of concrete of about 1500 cubic feet. The basin must be cleaned and debris removed prior to placement of concrete. Contractor will clean all equipment prior to entering the water and clean it again prior to leaving the site to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species. Contractor activities will include development of a concrete mix design, test block construction and placement demonstration, concrete testing, anchor testing, debris removal, basin cleaning, grouted anchor installation, drain installation, underwater concrete placement, concrete sampling, and completion of as-built drawings to meet the requirements of the specifications and any incidental related work.<BR><BR>Construction must occur in the winter months to avoid heavy recreation seasons, minimize impacts to aquatic life, and minimize construction during historic periods of high spillway releases.<BR><BR>The Magnitude of Construction for this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. <BR><BR>The NAICS code associated with this project is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. <BR><BR>It is anticipated at this time that this project will be advertised as an unrestricted, full-and-open competition requirement. <BR><BR>The Government anticipates that the solicitation will be posted on or about 20 May 2010. Offerors should check the Federal Business Opportunities website often for changes and updates.<BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>USACE District, Kansas City, ATTN: CENWK-CT, 700 Federal Building 60l East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106-2896 <BR>Place of Performance: <BR>USACE District, Kansas City ATTN: CENWK-CT, 700 Federal Building 60l East 12th Street Kansas City MO<BR>64106-2896<BR>US <BR>Point of Contact(s): <BR>James Kirk, 816 389-3853<BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY - GSFC Data Management System.  The goal of this project is to develop aData Management System for the NASA Center for Computational Sciences that provides adata grid approach to integrated, next-generation Earth science data services for NASA. A data grid is software that allows for the management, sharing, searching, anddistribution of large amounts of distributed data sets. The NASA Earth Science communitymaintains large quantities of both observation data from satellites and Earth basedobserving platforms (like ocean buoys) as well as model data generated by NASA climateapplications. Data grids are used to share and manage large amounts of geographicallydistributed data.  The Data Management System will provide a framework for the integrateddelivery of Earth observational data and climate simulation data from NASA models,thereby broadening the accessibility and usability of currently available data to theclimate science community. &lt;P&gt;NASA GSFC intends to acquire these Cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) services under agreementwith Computer Sciences Corporationunder a Task Order competitively awarded in 12/07. CPAFwas determined appropriate because the contract is for the performance of research anddevelopment effort, and uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permitcosts to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has awarded Sub-Task 50 to Northrop Grumman (NG)to provide an effort to test and analyze software to meet the needs of our particular useimplementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The effort is entitled,"Accelerator Technologies and Earth System Models."  The sub-task order was placed underthe existing Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract awarded back in 10/2005 to NG.  Theoriginal contract award was CPAF and was competitively awarded.  The work under Sub-Task50 cannot be performed on a fixed price basis due to variability of research anddevelopment projects.  CPAF was determined appropriate for this Sub-Task because thecontract is for performance of research and development effort, and uncertaintiesinvolved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficientaccuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.

The proposed system is comprised ofcompact high-performance compute hardware, global and regional climate and weathermodels, and ancillary analysis and visualization tools.  The contractor will be provideda high-performance desktop system and the tools are expected to be made operational. Thefollowing tools are expected to be made operational by the Contractor:	1) the currentversion ("MERRA") of NASA's global model that is used for research on climate change onthe seasonal to inter-annual scales; the 3.1 version of the Weather Research andForecasting model, a regional weather model that is widely used by the researchcommunity; 2) the 2009 optional version of the Global Forecast System, a weather modelused by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; 3) the current version("AR5") of the Model-E general circulation model, a global climate model being used bythe intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; 4) Ocean model(s) to supplement theatmospheric models described above; and 5) the Grid Analysis and Display System 2009version, a tool used by the community to visualize output. The contractor shall implementthe tools and perform a validation of each.  A feasibility study of available softwarerepository systems is also required.  The contractor shall host a workshop of active andpotential users of the toolkit here at GSFC, Greenbelt, MD.&lt;P&gt;These services were acquired under the existing cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract thatwas competitively awarded to the company on 10/2005. A CPAF arrangement was determinedappropriate because the contract is for the performance of research and developmenteffort, and uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to beestimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

<AWARDEE>Northrop Grumman TASC, 2411 Dulles Corner Park, Herndon, VA  20171-3430
<DESC>RECOVERY - NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has issued a modification toexisting Task Order NNG06HN01D with Northrop Grumman TASC to support the "Climate in aBox ("CIB") initiative.  CIB is intended to simplify the process of distributing NASA'sclimate models and related science analysis tools to investigators.  Under the currentmethodology, non-NASA investigators must acquire the softrware and perform animplementation on their local hardware, requiring significant interaction with NASAscientists.  By providing a "turnkey" system the need for such interactions will begreatly reduced.  The work under this effort would augment the ongoing development of ascientific workflow tool which will make the configuration and monitoring of climateexperiments less burdensome for new investigators. The contractor shall implement theNASA Experiment Design workflow tool as part of the standard software suite of the CIB.The workflow tool provides a GUI that will allow users to configure, run  and monitor CIBmodel execution either from a local machine of directly on the COB system.  The workflowtool would also enable the user to seamlessly transition from the CIB system to morecomputationally powerful runs on NASA's High End Computer Systems enabling them to runlarger or much longer duration simulations.  The contractor shall also propose a datasystem to support interoperability between the CIB and the High End Computing facilitiesat GSFC.&lt;P&gt;NASA GSFC intends to acquire these Cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) services under agreementwith Northrop Grumman TASC under a Task Order competitively awarded in 10/05.  CPAF wasdetermined appropriate because the contract is for the performance of research anddevelopment effort, and uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permitcosts to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has issued a Sub-Task Order to Northrop Grumman to develop and/or modifysoftware components that provide capabilities for coupling between the GSFC ChemistryAerosol Radiation and Transport aerosol model and Global Modeling Initiative chemistrymodules that are presently included in the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5General Circulation Model. The contractor shall develop and/or modify software componentsthat provide capabilities for coupling between the NASA Goddard Space Flight CenterChemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport aerosol model and the Global ModelingInitiative chemistry modules presently included in the Goddard Earth Observing System,Version 5 General Circulation Model.  The simulations will examine the coupling betweenaerosols and the chemistry modules with a focus on understanding the degree of couplingneeded to produce realistic combined distributions.  Analysis of the results shall becompleted in accordance with scientists in the Global Modeling Assimilation Office andthe Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Branch.	Longer coupled aerosol chemistrysimulations shall be performed to enable quantitative-assessments of the aerosol andchemistry distributions in the early 21st century, which will be analyzed in conjunctionwith NASA Earth Observing System satellite observations.  This work will help NASAscientists understand the importance of links between atmospheric aerosols and chemicalcomposition.  By adding the physical links between these processes in computer models andevaluating the simulations with NASA's observations, this work will provide an importantstep along the pathway to a full understanding of aerosols and chemistry in the climatesystem.  It will help NASA scientists use their observations to better understand theprocesses at work in the atmosphere.&lt;P&gt;This action will be awarded on a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee basis with Northrop Grumman under anexisting Task Order that was issued in 2005.  The work cannot be performed on a fixedprice basis due to variable research and development projects.	A reasonable estimate ofthe cost for the proposed effort cannot be made on a fixed-price basis.  A cost-typecontract provides the flexibility required to accommodate changes in program requirementswhich could potentially be substantial.&lt;P&gt;NASA GSFC intends to order these services with Northrop Grumman Information Technologies,Herndon, VA under the existing contract that was competitively awarded 10/05. &lt;P&gt;An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<h4>Contracting Office Address</h4>
<p>DHS - Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Office of the Chief Procurement Office, Mitigation Branch, 395 E St., S.W., Patriots Plaza 5<sup>th</sup> floor, Washington, DC, 20472-3215.</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Office of the Chief Procurement Office, Mitigation Branch, authorizes CSC Covansys to continue performance on Contract EMW-2003-CO-0458 under FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, while the follow-on procurement of solicitation number HSFEHQ-10-R-0014 is being processed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FEMA, Mitigation Directorate, Risk Insurance Division, requires continued uninterrupted flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any potential offeror's will need a certified and accredited (C&amp;A) Information Technology (IT) security system for all systems connected to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) network or operated by a contractor for DHS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created by Congress 1968 and is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), specifically the Mitigation Directorate. The purpose of the procurement is the selection of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) for those policies of insurance written directly by the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DSA shall have responsibility for the management, operation, maintenance and quality assurance for required activities and systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFIP provides flood insurance protection for property owners in return for local government commitment to sound flood plain management and related flood disaster mitigation efforts. The duties of FEMA, specifically the Mitigation Directorate, includes identifying communities with "special flood hazard areas," issuing maps for those areas, and helping communities meet flood plain management requirements. The regulations governing the National Flood Insurance Program are set forth in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, commencing at part 59.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1983, the Write Your Own (WYO) Program has become the primary vehicle for the delivery and service of flood insurance with participating companies writing over 94% of NFIP policies in their own names. The Government bears the underwriting risk for these policies as well as for the remaining policies for which the Government is the named insurer, i.e., the "Direct" business.</p>
<p>FEMA requires a Direct Servicing Agent to issue and service flood insurance policies, collect premiums, adjust and settle claims and, to disseminate information on insurance aspects of the Program to the public, lenders and agents. The Direct Servicing Agent provides day-to-day servicing of policies of flood insurance issued directly by FEMA pursuant to the NFIP.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Procurement Objectives include: (1) Maintain, in an uninterrupted manner and to program and contract standards, the day-to-day servicing of directly written standard flood insurance policies, Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) and Group [National] Flood Insurance Program (GFIP) Policies including underwriting, claims examination and payment, financial accounting, and reporting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(2) Help coordinate operations of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) servicing facility with Bureau and Statistical Agent (BSA) contractor, the NFIP Information Technology contractor and other insurance and government hazard mitigation and disaster response activities. (3) Operate as fiduciary agent for premium and other NFIP funds collection, and meet Government deposit and other accounting requirements as well as other applicable requirements (such as those contained in the Plan to Maintain Financial Control for Business Written under the Write-Your-Own Program), of the flood insurance program. (4) Meet regular information and reporting requirements including the statistical and other requirements contained in the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRRP) Plan. (5) Provide information management systems that encompass cash management, policy administration, claims management, performance management reporting, and financial and statistical reporting.</p>
