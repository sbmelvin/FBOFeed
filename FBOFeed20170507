All SF 330s received by the due date and time will be evaluated by an Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the Evaluation Factors identified in this announcement.  After SF 330s have been evaluated, Discussions/Interviews will be held with at least three (3) of the most highly qualified firms.  After discussions conclude, the TEB will evaluate the qualifications of the firms using the same evaluation factors, taking into consideration both the SF 330s and discussions, to select the most preferred firm from the firms considered to be the most highly qualified.  Negotiations will then begin with the most preferred firm.

DEFINITIONS AND RATINGS FOR EVALUATION FACTORS:
One (1) of the following Ratings will be assigned to each factor above:
RATING
DEFINITION
Exceptional
Contains one or more considerable strengths which yield significant benefit.  Weaknesses, if any, are of small impact.  There are no significant weaknesses and there are no deficiencies.  
Good
Contains one or more strengths which yield some benefit.  Weaknesses are of small impact.  There are no significant weaknesses and there are no deficiencies.
Satisfactory
Meets all of the requirements stated in the Request for SF 330.  Firm offers no significant benefits beyond the stated requirements, but has no significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.
Marginal
Firm has shortcomings that raise questions about whether some of the requirements can be met, or has one or more significant weaknesses, but no deficiencies.
Unsatisfactory
Fails to meet most of the requirements of the Request for SF 330.  Firm has significant weaknesses and one or more deficiencies.

EVALUATION PROCESS:
The TEB will evaluate each firm s SF 330 submission strictly on its content and will not assume that performance will include anything not specified in the submission. The evaluation will be conducted in accordance with the procedures established herein.

The TEB will evaluate and rate evaluation factors using the evaluation criteria above and then submit a consensus evaluation to the Contracting Officer (see attachments).  The TEB will document strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, deficiencies, and potential discussion questions for each firm s submission.  The TEB will recommend a minimum of three (3) firms with which discussions will be held.

The Contracting Officer will review the TEB s ratings of each firm and select a minimum of three (3) firms for discussions.  The Contracting Officer and TEB will then participate in discussions with the selected firms.  Any information obtained during discussions will be evaluated by the TEB using the same criteria used the evaluations of the SF 330 submissions.

The TEB will then prepare a selection report for the Selection Authority recommending, in order of preference, at least three (3) firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to perform the required services.  The report shall include a description of the discussions and evaluations conducted by the TEB to allow the Selection Authority to review the considerations upon which the recommendations are based.

The Selection Authority shall review the recommendations of the TEB and shall, with the advice of appropriate technical and staff representatives, make the final selection.  The final selection shall be a listing, in order of preference, of the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  If the firms listed as the most preferred are not the firms recommended as the most highly qualified by the TEB, the Selection Authority shall provide for the contract file a written explanation of the reason for the preference.  All firms on the final selection list will be considered  selected firms  with which the Contracting Officer may negotiate in accordance with FAR Part 36.606 and VAAR Part 836.606.

The Selection Authority shall not add firms to the selection report.  If the firms recommended in the report are not deemed to be qualified or the report is considered inadequate for any reason, the Selection Authority shall record the reasons and return the report to the TEB for appropriate revision.

The TEB shall be promptly informed of the final selection.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011	Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a)  Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b)  If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (BRAND NAME:OEM replacement part)</p>
<p>The supplies or services required under this requisition are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the Government's need. There is a reasonable basis to conclude that the Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available only from one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities. The following justification applies.</p>
<p>An acquisition that uses a brand name (Furuno, Motorola, Vidmar) or other description to specify a particular brand name, product or feature of a product peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. Beyond that, if you choose to limit the number of sources of a particular brand name/OEM, the procurement is "sole/limited source," which is more difficult to justify. However, if the specification is brand name or equal, then the procurement is competitive.</p>
<p>Describe the item and/or services required:<br />The RHIB BLADDERS being purchased are direct replacements for the RHIB bladders that are worn out in service and beyond economical repair.  Willard Marine, Inc holds the proprietary design data, material specifications and operating parameters relating to the manufacture of the RHIB bladders being purchased. There are no other licensed vendors in the country capable of producing or providing repair parts for this equipment.  The vessel's RHIBs are inspected by the United States Coast Guard as part of the Certificate of Inspection for the vessel<br /> <br />Failure to complete this order in a Sole Source and timely manner so that material arrives for the defined performance period could prevent the timely departure of the vessel. No other manufacturer can meet the required time frame and to synopsize would only produce a Sole Source Requirement<br /> <br />Therefore due to the criticality of this equipment in meeting the ships mission and meeting USCG regulations pertaining to Operational Requirements, it is in the best interest of the government to forego synopsis from&nbsp;"other than&nbsp;OEM / Aftermarket"&nbsp; Manufacturers and avoid future delays in installation or possible failure of incompatible /&nbsp;NON OEM AUTHORIZED parts. <br /> <br />Failure to complete this critical repair work item during the "scheduled" voyage repair or to complete with other than OEM parts may have detrimental effects on future "mission" readiness. No other manufacturer will serve the required needs and to procure from other than OEM could be catastrophic to the equipment and ultimately limit mission capability. Therefore it is in the best interest of the government to forego synopsis and procure the required</p>
<p>Known Source(s) for the item or services:<br />WILLARD MARINE, INC <br />1250 N. GROVE ST.<br />ANAHEIM, CA 92806<br />POC: NICK CASTILLO <br />PH: 741 666-2150 X 238</p>
<p>1. This determination for single/limited source procurement for this requirement is based on one or more of the following.<br />A. RESTRICTIVE RIGHTS. The existence of proprietary rights, limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights or secret processes make the required item or service available from only one source. The parts being procured are patented with proprietary rights to the OEM. As shown on the drawings, who is identified as "owning" the drawing: Willard Marine. The parts were manufactured and patented with proprietary rights by the OEM. C. CRITICAL SHIP EQUIPMENT. The required item is critical ship equipment the failure of which poses a hazard to the ship, the crew and/or the environment. SMS #10.6-002-ALL. The RHIB is the device used in case of a man overboard emergency.  Each T-AO is required by USCG and ABS to have this equipment operational in order to leave port.<br />D. STANDARDIZATION. In accordance with MSC's standardization initiative, only the specified make and model of equipment/parts will satisfy the Government's needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available. (i.e., ship currently has 10 Motorola radios onboard and five more need to be purchased to bring onboard allowances up to 15). Make and Model Number:Willard Marine, SEA FORCE 670 SOLAS Rescue Boat. other ships that have this same Make and Model Number: All T-AO's</p>
