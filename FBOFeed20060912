<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Region, requires a contractor to video, photograph, map and catalogue geomorphic and biological shore-zone resources at effective mapping scales of better than 1:10,000 for various locations in Southeast Alaska (SEAK) and potentially other locations of Alaska including Prince William Sound (PWS).  The objective of this project is to complete the necessary inventory and mapping of various segments of Alaska coastline in order to compile a continuous dataset.  The base data used for habitat mapping in ShoreZone is low-tide aerial and still imagery.  Research and management activities by federal, state, and local agencies and by nongovernmental organizations require a georeferenced GIS dataset that includes shoreline geomorphology, substrate, and important biological habitats.  
The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a minimum order amount of $10,000 and maximum order amount of $1,500,000 over the life of the contract.  Task Orders will be issued on an as needed basis defining specific ShoreZone sites and deliverables.  The period of performance will begin on date of contract award (approx. 9/15/06) and will continue for four one-year option periods (approx. 9/14/11).   


A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be available on or about May 15, 2006, through this website.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.  It is incumbent upon interested parties to register at the solicitation's site for notification and to review the site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.

<SUBJECT>F -- Susquehanna River Basin Forecast and Warning System
<SOLNBR>EA133W-06-RQ-0999
<RESPDATE>092206

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service is issuing a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), to provide the components to the Susquehanna Flood Forecast and Warning.  SRBC is involved in the flood management and protection throughout the Susquehanna River Basin.  This requirement is a continuation to maintain an enhanced flood warning system in the Susquehanna River Basin.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by September 22, 2006.  This notice of intent is not a requirement for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition

The Susquehanna River Basin Commission is the one and only responsible source that is able to coordinate the Susquehanna Flood Forecast and Warning System due to their role in the Susquehanna River Basin as defined by Congress.

The Susquehanna River is the nation?s sixteenth largest river and is the larger river lying entirely in the United States that flows into the Atlantic Ocean.  The Susquehanna and its hundreds of tributaries drain 27,510 square miles, an area nearly the size of South Carolina, spread over parts of the states New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.

The river meanders 444 miles from its origin at Otsego Lake near Cooperstown, N.Y. until it empties into the Chesapeake Bay at Havre de Grace, MD.  The Susquehanna contributes one-half of the freshwater flow to the Bay.

The river basin borders the major population centers of the east coast, and although relatively undeveloped, has experienced problems of water pollution and over usage.  Because the Susquehanna River flows through three states and is classified as a navigable waterway by the federal government, there are state, regional, and national interests involved.  There is a need to coordinate the efforts of three states and the agencies of the federal government, as well as a need to establish a management system to oversee the use of the water and related natural resources of the Susquehanna.

These needs led to the drafting of the Susquehanna River Basin Compact, which was signed into law on December 24, 1970.  The Compact, as adopted by the Congress of the United States, and the legislatures of New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, provides the mechanism to guide the conservation, development, and administration of the water resources of the vast river basin.

The Compact established the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) as the agency to coordinate the water resources efforts of the three states and the federal government.  

Each member is represented by a commissioner who serves as the spokesperson for the government that he or she represents.  In the case of the federal government, the commissioner and his alternate are appointed by the President of the United States.  For the three states the commissioners are the governors or their designees.  The governors also appoint alternate commissioners.  Under the leadership of an Executive Director, technical, administrative, and clerical personnel support the daily operations of the Commission.

The mission of the SRBC, which is defined in the Compact, is to enhance public welfare through comprehensive planning, water supply allocation, and management of the water resources of the Susquehanna River Basin.

To accomplish this mission, the SRBC works to reduce damages caused by floods; provide for the reasonable and sustained development and use of surface and ground water for municipal, agricultural, recreational, commercial and industrial purposes; protect and restore fisheries, wetlands and aquatic habitat; protect water quality and in stream uses; and ensure future availability of flows to the Chesapeake Bay.

The SRBCV is uniquely qualified to carry out this mission.  As a federal-interstate compact commission, its focus is defined by the natural boundaries of the river basin rather than the political boundaries of the member states.  As such, the SRBC serves as a forum to provide coordinated management, promote communication among the members, and resolve water resource issues and controversies within the basin.

<DESC>A sole source award is contemplated with Coherent Systems International Incorporated, Lexington Park, MD to develop a Ground Mobile Gateway (GMG) Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Training Course.  Coherent is the only qualified source to conduct this effort.  The contract schedule anticipates award for training development in October 2006 with delivery of the training 90 days after contract award.  The contract will require the contractor to develop comprehensive O&M training for all Ground Mobile Gateway system components and provide detailed training whose measured output is military personnel with the skills and understanding to train other military personnel on GMG O&M procedures.  The GMG is a prototype tactical system consisting of an integrated suite of communications and networking equipment installed in a highly modified, HMMWV-mounted -788 equipment shelter.  Three HMMWV systems are currently being developed by Coherent and comprehensive O&M training is required prior to transitioning the systems to stateside and overseas operational units. The major components include, but are not limited to,  Global Positioning System receivers, central processing units, routers, Joint Range Extension (JRE), AN/PRC-117(F) radios, PRC-150 C radio, Situational Awareness Data Link, MIDS LVT-2 Link-16, MRC-185 (Rover III), INMARSAT-B, Cellular Base Station, Secure Terminal Equipment (STE), and Tactical Operations Center Inter-Communications System (TOCNET).  Associated with the systems are the appropriate antenna systems for fixed and mobile operations. The operator training scope will include GMG normal and emergency operating conditions, and mission operations in an exercise environment. The maintenance training scope will include troubleshooting system anomalies to Line Replaceable Unit, along with organizational level preventive and corrective maintenance on the GMG repairable components.  The objectives of the organic training program are: (1) to provide military personnel who have basic computer, networking and radio knowledge and skills with the capability to operate and maintain the GMG in normal and emergency operations with no supervision.  It is expected the course will be conducted at the Government?s facility, 17th Communications Squadron (Bldg 112), 131 Flightline Ave., Goodfellow AFB, TX 76908-3505.  The duration of the course will be whatever is necessary to complete an in-depth Course of Instruction (COI).  Estimated course length is 6 weeks; 2 weeks classroom, 2 weeks hands-on operations, culminating with a 2 week operational exercise, e.g., JDICE @ Nellis AFB, NV.  Government will have unlimited data rights for all training data products used during training which should include lesson plan(s), instructional materials which enhance the trainee?s mastery of those knowledge and skills for a given subject, instructional visual aids, and condensed operator checklists for field operations.  Coherent is the only company that can accomplish the training while meeting the GMG fielding schedule.  As the system developer/integrator of the first generation prototype system, only they have the requisite knowledge regarding equipment installation, inter-/intra-connectivity and operational experience to provide the appropriate level of training in the time frame required.  The Government intends to award a sole source contract for GMG O&M training with only one source under the authority of FAR6.302-1. See Numbered Note 22.  Submit within 30 days of publication, to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn: Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810.

<DESC>POC:     Mr. Joseph Simonds, Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), SMC/XDK, (310) 653-9096, Joseph.Simonds@losangeles.af.mil; Mr. David Banks, Contract Specialist, SMC/XDK (310) 653-9093, David.Banks@losangeles.af.mil.

The Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to issue a sole source contract to complete the Concept Analysis & Support tasks already in progress to CSC.  This contract is valued at approximately $150,000.00.     The period of performance is approximately 6 months.  This task requires an intimate and detailed knowledge of the existing tasks being completed and the ability to continue the efforts from the current level of support through its completion.  CSC has been executing these efforts since the inception of this task.  Not only is CSC responsible for the ground work previously completed, but they are also responsible for concepts to support the needs and/or gaps recognized through forums such as the AFSPC Integrated Planning process (IPP), Capability Reviews & Risk Assessment groups (CRRA) and Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs).  Additionally, Cost Analysis Support as well as the continued development and idea collection for the needs of the Warfighter program have been under the purview of CSC in support of the mission of SMC/XD.  

The additional responsibilities under this effort includes Involvement in Technical Planning Integrated Product Teams (TPIPTs) for material solutions, interacting with the DoD Space Architect, providing POM guidance to USAF staff offices, Interacting with product teams from AFSPC & the development of cost models.

CSC is the only responsible source for the completion of these tasks under the current timeline.  CSC has performed over 6 of the 7 years of work required under the Concept Cost Analysis & Support Contract.  Additionally, CSC has been intimately involved in the Cost Model Development support, coming in at the ground level and building the support to the level it is at today.   

Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirements and submit their capabilities and qualifications statement to the PCO.  The Capabilities Statement should state why the company believes a sole source award is invalid.  The Capability Statement will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government and will be coordinated between the PCO and the Functional Area Evaluator for technical merit.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK
TO 
MODERNIZE THREE ELEVATOR AT THE FDIC BUILDING
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA



PART I.	PROJECT IDENTIFICATION
A.	TITLE	MODERNIZE THREE ELEVATORS
B.	BUILDING	FDIC BUILDING
C.	LOCATION	25 JESSIE STREET, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
D.	PROJECT CONTROL NO.	
E.	GSA WORK ITEM NO.	

PART II.	BACKGROUND
The FDIC Building is an 18 level steel structure, with sheetrock lined hoistways constructed in 1982 and is occupied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  The building is located at 25 Jessie Street, San Francisco, California.  The building requires the modernization of a three car elevator group, which serves the front entrance Lobby, and floor stops 6-12, 14-23.  Work shall included, but not limited to, the complete overhaul of elevator equipment and cab finishes for cars Nos. 1, 2, and 3 as defined in the contract documents.
All three elevators are of the same internal dimensions, 6?-8? x 4?-2? with a certified rated load of 2500#, the car operating panels are incorrectly engraved as 3500# and needs to be changed to 2500#.
Car No. 3 has an internal height of 9?-0? to canopy and cars No. 1 & 2 have an internal height of 8?-4?.  Cars No. 1 through 3 are correctly sized to accommodate wheelchairs, but are insufficiently sized to accommodate and emergency stretcher.  The size of the existing elevators will not be increased under this contract as the physical size of the hoistways will not allow for such a change.  There is a Call button at each floor.
The elevators are gearless traction type and designed to travel at a speed of 700 FPM.  The front entrances are 3?-6? x 7?-0? with center opening configuration.
The DC drive machines are 480 volt.  Each elevator machine is rated at 34.3 HP at 228 volts, with 25 KW generators and 40 HP AC motor.  The incoming three phase electrical feeders to each elevator are #2 AWG.  There is no direct ground conductor included with the three phase feeders.  The elevator group is connected to the emergency generator; which is rated to operate one elevator at a time under emergency power conditions.
The elevators have been provided with Phase 1 Firefighters Service manual recall key switch at the First Floor and with smoke detectors at each landing.  Phase 2 Firefighters Service is provided in each elevator.  The existing system operation will be modified, when the elevator controls are replaced, to comply with current elevator code.
The three elevators operate in a common hoistway that are directly vented into the elevator machine room and then exits the room via high level louvers in the West wall, which is now illegal per UCB requirements section 2004.  The local Fire Marshal?s office has not been contacted to ensure they will not retroactively enforce compliance.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of power generation sets (deployable non-CIS equipment).

NAMSA is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. NAMSA intends to use the one step ICB bidding procedure. Partial bidding is not allowed.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 2.5 million (USD $ 3.2 million). The reference for this project is Serial 2003/0HQ3031 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-CIS-2003-HQ3031.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The assets must be capable of rapid and efficient deployment, on and beyond Alliance Territory, including areas with limited or no Host National Support (HNS). It is essential that the readiness of the NATO Signal Battalion CIS matches that of the Command and Control (C2) elements comprising the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) C2 structure. This means that most of the deployable CIS equipment and associated personnel is to be at 30 days Notice-to-Move (NTM). Some specific elements required for Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Teams as well as NATO Response Force (NRF) functions will be held at a higher readiness state.

Deployable non-CIS assets need to be air-transportable by means of tactical airframe (including C-130 or national equivalent dimension) and by Chinook-type helicopters (long range Line of Sight (LOS) relay only) as well as transportable by road (improved and unimproved), rail and sea. It is essential that deployable CIS shelters be complete with integral prime movers.

The equipment must be capable of sustaining effective operations over a variety of terrain and in ambient temperatures ranging between -32 degrees Celsius and +49 degrees Celsius (-33 degrees Celsius to +71 degrees Celsius for storage and transit) in climatic zones A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C0, and C1 as specified at STANAG 2895.
	
Based on the CJTF Operational Concept, Collective Protection (COLPRO) against Biological and Chemical (BC) agents must be sufficient to allow essential staff and support elements to operate within a contaminated environment for a defined period of time. This must include protection against Toxic Industrial Contaminants (TICs). The COLPRO equipment should be an integral part of the Office Modules (OMs), Joint Operation Center (JOC) shelters and CIS shelters and include the means for over-pressurization, air-filtration, and protected entrance facilities.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Contract Order to assess the service life of the Tomahawk Block IV Capsule Closure Assembly.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS),  P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ  85734-1337.  RMS is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer of the Tomahawk All-Up-Round.  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV Missile.  RMS currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  RMS is responsible for maintaining the existing Capsules and performing any required re-certification, repair, refurbishment or remanufacture of them.  RMS is the only source that possesses the current technical, configuration, manufacturing data, and unique expertise required to produce a Tomahawk Block IV Capsule capable of complying with the Tactical Tomahawk Block IV configuration.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to provide these CCLS Capsules, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of cost.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a continuing requirement for a Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Beginning in September 1999, the NCI created via contract the CTSU; the intent was to facilitate access by investigators to a broader menu of clinical trials led by Cooperative Groups or other investigators and to centralize and make more efficient a number of administrative tasks common to all the Cooperative Group Operations and Statistical/Data Management Centers.  The CTSU has, in fact, facilitated the conduct of trials by allowing a participating physician to perform registration and data management of patients on the trials of all Groups irrespective of the Group in which he/she is a member.  To further facilitate these cross-Group enrollments, the CTSU developed auditing, financial payment, and education/training systems that complement and interdigitate with the existing Cooperative Group systems.  In addition to Group members, the CTSU has also provided a mechanism for unaffiliated sites to participate in trials on the CTSU menu.

The CTSU systems are primarily web-based (www.ctsu.org) and there is a public and private website.  Only registered investigators have access to the private site where they can access materials and tools for enrolling patients on clinical trials. Presently the CTSU menu of over 60 trials consists primarily of phase 3 treatment trials in breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, hematologic and other less common tumors.  In addition, a more limited menu of phase 2 multi-center treatment trials is also available.  Investigators who are members of a Cooperative Group automatically have access to all CTSU trials, and some sites unaffiliated with Groups, have also been granted access, after undergoing a credentialing and review process conducted by the CTSU.

The purpose of this acquisition is to build upon the progress made over the last 6 years and expand the CTSU’s primary tasks, which include:  1) Operation of the CTSU comprehensive system for clinical trials management with state-of-the-art, web-based, registration, randomization and data collection/query systems; 2) Operation of the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) to consolidate IRB approvals along with site and investigator credentialing for all Adult Group trials, phases 1-3; 3) Operation of the CTSU web site for accessing protocols, forms, and education/training materials; 4) Conduct education and training (generic and study-specific) for the CTSU systems and its menu of protocols; 5) Operation of the CTSU quality assurance system, including on-site auditing and real-time monitoring of data collection delinquencies and errors; 6) Operation of the CTSU financial management system for distribution of per case payments, leadership funds, investigator travel and technical expertise reimbursements; and 7) Operation of the CICRS (Clinical Independent Cancer Research Sites) program to permit unaffiliated sites to join the CTSU.

This is a recompetition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a base period of three years with the opportunity for the contractor to earn up to four additional contract years (Award Terms).  RFP No. N02-CM-67001-48 will be issued on or about January 9, 2006.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ .  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No Collect Calls will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) for the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) at the National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Twilight Training LLC, 519 IH-30 #247, Rockwall, Texas 75087, to conduct the evaluation of ?CSR Processes (Simulation Models) that Predict Proposal Demand & Related Workload Resources?.   The statement of work is as follows:  Background:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Scientific Review (CSR) manages the flow of incoming research proposals to NIH.  CSR receives all NIH proposals.  In triage fashion, CSR decides which area within NIH is the most appropriate to review the proposals.  Approximately 40% of the proposals are referred to other groups, and approximately 60% of the proposals are reviewed by CSR personnel.  This equates to about 45,000 to 50,000 proposals per year that are reviewed by CSR.  Periodically, CSR management must adjust the number of CSR reviewers to meet the incoming level of proposal demand.  Annually, CSR management must forecast the next year?s expected resource level for budgeting purposes.  If the forecast is significantly different from the actual required level of resources, several mid-year funding changes must be accommodated.  These changes are time-consuming, wasteful, and prevent proper allocation of funds to other areas within CSR and NIH.  Consequently, CSR management is motivated to create more accurate forecasts of the number of incoming proposals so that the proper level of resources can be established.  In the past, CSR has used statistical forecasts for incoming demand.  At times, this method has been significantly erroneous, resulting in mid-year funding and resource allocation changes.  As an example, one year the statistical forecast predicted a 9% reduction in applications, but the actual number of applications that came in during that year represented a 21% increase over the previous year.  As a result, CSR desires to explore other forecasting methods in an attempt to improve its prediction of required resource levels.  Scope of Work:  The objective of this project is to understand changes in applicant behavior to create a better forecast of the demand for review services.  A system dynamics (SD) simulation model will be developed as an alternative to the traditional statistical model.  An SD model is a structural model of the system under study, which means that it incorporates the operational activities and management processes that make up that system itself.  (See Appendix A for an example.)  On the other hand, statistical models only use data related to the system under study and, in fact, treat the system itself as a black box for which there is no knowledge of the internal workings.   Because most of the SD model will revolve around activities and decision-making processes that lie outside of CSR, part of this effort will include interviews with members of academia to understand better their processes and motivations for submitting applications to NIH.  Appendix A:  Example System Dynamics (SD) Model will be provided on request.


The period of performance is expected to begin on September 2006 through March 2007.  

Dr. J. Chris White of Twilight Training has been contracted by the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) to gather similar data for another prediction model.  In order to take advantage of the knowledge gained in that project and lower the overall costs of this study, the Government seeks to acquire the services of Twilight Training for this effort.  In order to maintain continuity of the methodologies used in the previous OER studies and the knowledge gained by Twilight Training in the completion of the studies a sole source award is contemplated.  The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge and experience the gained by Twilight Training during the performance on the previous NIH, OER evaluation project.   An award to any other source for this follow-on contract would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures.  It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable simplified acquisition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541990, Size Standard $6.5 million dollars.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Dr., San Diego, CA 92121-1975.  This purchase is to perform a SNP?s fine mapping on genomic regions demonstrating significant linkage and linkage disequilibrium to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This must be done by utilizing custom design SNP?s markers for fine mapping.  Using linkage disequilibrium analysis with both haplotype based and cladistic analysis three genes have been found that might be the cause of the disorder.  It will be necessary to use a set of SNP?s markers with an average density lower than 1cM in order to effectively continue studying the genetics of ADHD.  The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and scientific specifications of gene mapping; and 2)  past performance. 

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Illumina has a collection of SNP markers with the highest density possible and can provide return results within 60 days of receiving DNA samples.  As part of an ongoing protocol, changing variables at this time would result in incorrect interpretation of the experiments already in progress.  In an effort to preserve the investments already made by the government in this research it is recommended that award of this requirement go to Illumina, Inc.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541710 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The purpose of this general synopsis is to provide for the earliest notice of this schedule-driven procurement. NASA/Glenn Research Center (GRC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Launch Vehicle Stage Severance System in mid-October.	The draft RFP (NNC06ZDE035J) will be posted on or about September 19, 2006.	Target release dates for the final RFP are included in the description below.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 336419 and 1000, respectively.   GRC anticipates an Industry Briefing, addressing the procurement to be held in the Cleveland, Ohio area on September 21, 2006.  NASA GRC personnel will be available to discuss plans for the Severance System during this event. Please refer to the separate announcement, with registration form, posted on August 16, 2006, detailing this event.   http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/Procure/Industry_Day.html  The ARES I Launch Vehicle is a new launch vehicle NASA is developing to replace the Space Shuttle and to return astronauts to the moon.  ARES I-1 is the first flight of this new launch vehicle and will demonstrate ascent flight control system performance.  The upper stage will be an inert mass model.  One of the primary objectives of the first flight will be to demonstrate nominal 1st and 2nd stage separation and clearances.   The development, testing, fabrication and flight qualification of this system will require a very aggressive schedule.  NASA GRC is requesting a delivery of a full test qualification unit in March, 2008.  The first flight severance unit is expected in June, 2008.  The flight of ARES I-1 is scheduled for April, 2009.  A second flight article may be purchased for delivery in December 2008 for a follow on flight that is currently TBD.  The contractor shall be required to support NASA during integration and system level qualification testing planned at NASA Plumbrook in Sandusky OH.  The contractor shall also be required to provide support during integration, assembly and final inspection during assembly of the severance system into the ARESI-1 Interstage flight element.  NASA is open to industry's creative design.	The proposed system must have flight heritage.  NASA GRC’s anticipated value of this procurement is $1.5M - $2M. NASA may decide that the best value is with proposals offering distinctly different approachess under consideration for multiple awards. Target date for release of the draft RFP NNC06ZDE035J is on or about September 19, 2006.  Target date for release of the final RFP NNC06ZDE035R is October 11, 2006.

<DESC>1.  COMPREHENSIVE LARGE ARRAY-DATA STEWARDSHIP SYSTEM (CLASS) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SERVICES
The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) plans to establish a contract for Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) Information Technology (IT) support services.  The Government anticipates awarding a performance-based contract to support the development, engineering, integration, test, operations, and maintenance of CLASS and the Archive, Access and Distribution System (AADS).  This anticipated competitive acquisition is a reissue of a previously cancelled COMMITS NexGEN Program Request for Solution (T3-0005).  This notice supersedes all previous notices including the notice provided at: http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOC/NOAA/AGAMD/CLASS070000035/SynopsisP.html.     

2.  SCOPE OF WORK
The CLASS contractor will meet requirements for the planning, development, and subsequent operations and maintenance of a secure, highly reliable, and evolutionary environmental data storage and distribution system.  These requirements are integral to NOAA mission accomplishment.  Contractor support in Information Technology (IT) and IT related services is critical to the CLASS program business function.  As a Performance-Based Acquisition, this contract provides for the contractor s payment and incentives to be based on meeting service levels necessary to efficiently and economically support NESDIS in maintaining and evolving CLASS. 

NOAA seeks a contractor that will bring a mission focus providing highly effective, secure and reliable computing and communications resources.  Further, the successful contractor must also continuously identify methods for applying information technology to improve mission performance and reduce total program costs (i.e., Life Cycle Cost).  NOAA seeks a contractor that brings proven expertise to identify, implement, and manage effective and efficient application and use of information technology to meet the CLASS mission. 

3.  BACKGROUND
The CLASS program will enable NESDIS to better meet NOAA s responsibility for long-term archiving of the Nation s environmental data.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for archival storage and management of environmental data and information, and has hundreds of millions of environmental observations stored on a variety of media dating back as far as the mid-1890s.  These data support the Nation s ability to ensure human safety and welfare, sustain economic stability and growth, and maintain environmental integrity.  The ability to archive, integrate, access, and distribute environmental data and information is critical to the fulfillment of NOAA strategic goals.  Today, there are demands on virtually all of NOAA programs to provide information on the health of the environment in real-time.  The CLASS Program is NOAA s major initiative to re-engineer, modernize, and enhance the current suite of national environmental data storage and access services to better serve the current and future environmental data and information needs of the United States.

Two contractors currently provide IT support to CLASS:  Global Science & Technology, Inc. (formerly TMC Technologies Inc., 2110 Pleasant Valley Road, Fairmont, WV  16554-8554), 7855 Walker Drive Suite 200, Greenbelt, MD  20770-3239; and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), 15245 Shady Grove Road, Suite 200, Rockville, MD  20850-3222.

4.  PRESOLICITATION NOTICE INFORMATION
NOAA is anticipating a best-value performance-based acquisition with a potential period of performance of nine years.  The anticipated period of performance includes a base year, four (4) one-year option periods and four (4) one-year award terms.  NOAA anticipates awarding one contract as a result of this competition. The anticipated contract type is Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) with task order provisions for the issuance of fixed-price and cost reimbursement task orders.  This requirement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside using North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541512 Computer Systems Design Services with a size standard of $23,000,000.00.  The CLASS requirements are primarily computer planning and designing computer systems that integrate computer hardware, software, and communication technologies.  Further instructions will follow in the CLASS Request for Proposal (RFP).  The CLASS RFP and its attachments will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov under Agency: Department of Commerce (DOC), Office: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Location: Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Reference Number: EA133E-06-RFI-0001.  A digital library of CLASS technical data will be provided through https://www.fedteds.gov.  Interested parties are responsible for checking the www.fedbizopps.gov website regularly for release of the RFP and for instructions for accessing other procurement-related documents.  Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and list of interested vendors will not be available.  The CLASS RFP is anticipated for release on or about November 14, 2006.  Contract award is anticipated for April-May 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD?s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements.

Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.

<CONTACT>John Manouelian, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-3813, Fax (301) 402-6699, Email jm486p@nih.gov
<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a continuing requirement for a Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Beginning in September 1999, the NCI created via contract the CTSU; the intent was to facilitate access by investigators to a broader menu of clinical trials led by Cooperative Groups or other investigators and to centralize and make more efficient a number of administrative tasks common to all the Cooperative Group Operations and Statistical/Data Management Centers.  The CTSU has, in fact, facilitated the conduct of trials by allowing a participating physician to perform registration and data management of patients on the trials of all Groups irrespective of the Group in which he/she is a member.  To further facilitate these cross-Group enrollments, the CTSU developed auditing, financial payment, and education/training systems that complement and interdigitate with the existing Cooperative Group systems.  In addition to Group members, the CTSU has also provided a mechanism for unaffiliated sites to participate in trials on the CTSU menu.

The CTSU systems are primarily web-based (www.ctsu.org) and there is a public and private website.  Only registered investigators have access to the private site where they can access materials and tools for enrolling patients on clinical trials. Presently the CTSU menu of over 60 trials consists primarily of phase 3 treatment trials in breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, hematologic and other less common tumors.  In addition, a more limited menu of phase 2 multi-center treatment trials is also available.  Investigators who are members of a Cooperative Group automatically have access to all CTSU trials, and some sites unaffiliated with Groups, have also been granted access, after undergoing a credentialing and review process conducted by the CTSU.

The purpose of this acquisition is to build upon the progress made over the last 6 years and expand the CTSU’s primary tasks, which include:  1) Operation of the CTSU comprehensive system for clinical trials management with state-of-the-art, web-based, registration, randomization and data collection/query systems; 2) Operation of the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) to consolidate IRB approvals along with site and investigator credentialing for all Adult Group trials, phases 1-3; 3) Operation of the CTSU web site for accessing protocols, forms, and education/training materials; 4) Conduct education and training (generic and study-specific) for the CTSU systems and its menu of protocols; 5) Operation of the CTSU quality assurance system, including on-site auditing and real-time monitoring of data collection delinquencies and errors; 6) Operation of the CTSU financial management system for distribution of per case payments, leadership funds, investigator travel and technical expertise reimbursements; and 7) Operation of the CICRS (Clinical Independent Cancer Research Sites) program to permit unaffiliated sites to join the CTSU.

This is a recompetition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a base period of three years with the opportunity for the contractor to earn up to four additional contract years (Award Terms).  RFP No. N02-CM-67001-48 will be issued on or about January 10, 2006.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ .  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No Collect Calls will be accepted.

In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) intents to procure professional services, on a sole source basis, from Henry Lewis, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL.  			
Period of Performance:

September 29, 2006 through September 28, 2007 with three (4) additional one-year options.

Background:

In 1991 the National Library of Medicine's Specialized Information Services (SIS)  Division commenced a one-year pilot initiative referred to as TIOP (the Toxicology Information Outreach Project).  Its modest but important mission was to strengthen the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to train health professionals to use NLM's Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program databases.  Representatives of eight HBCUs attended the first TIOP meeting, held at NLM in August of that year.  In the more than fifteen years since its inception, the project has strengthened the link between NLM and HBCUs to a point where by the year 2000 nearly 80 minority institutions had received training under the TIOP program.  

NLM has reengineered TIOP, which is now called EnHIOP, the Environmental Health Information Outreach Program. EnHIOP builds upon the original TIOP, but now also includes a stronger focus on environmental health, minority health and health disparities. EnHIOP also includes a larger and more diverse groups of institutions, smaller HBCUs beyond those with graduate programs in the health sciences, as well as tribal colleges and Hispanic serving institutions. 

Purpose:

There are three major activities to be accomplished by this purchase order.  It will be the decision of the contractor to best decide the method of completing these tasks.  Evaluation of outcomes is an important component of all NLM outreach activities.

Task 1:  The contractor will provide guidance to NLM in the management and development of EnHIOP and other related initiatives involving minority serving educational institutions.

Task 2:  Carry out administrative activities related to serving as chair of EnHIOP such as preparing materials for meetings, preparing reports and analyses.

Task 3:  As requested by NLM, represent EnHIOP at professional meetings and conferences including giving presentations about EnHIOP and NLM and promoting health information access for minorities.

Sole Source Justification
Dr. Lewis is the only contractor known to NLM that is uniquely qualified to carry out the tasks of the SOW and assist NLM in this requirement due to his academic background and excellent connections with administrators of minority serving educational institutions.  Dr. Lewis has Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from FAMU and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Mercer University School of Pharmacy.  In addition, Dr. Lewis has experience as chair of EnHIOP.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations, nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  
 
The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CANCEL PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, NLM-06-221/RHW, IN ITS ENTIRETY.



In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) intents to procure professional services, on a sole source basis, from Melvin Spann, Ph.D., SGH Medtech Consult, Inc., Silver Spring, MD.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5 Mil.
			
Period of Performance:

September 29, 2006 through September 28, 2007 with 3 one-year options

Background

Over the past half century, the nation's investment in scientific research has resulted in unprecedented revolutionary progress in biological, medical, and material sciences. Information technology holds the promise of delivering specific knowledge in a timely manner to billions of people worldwide, in ways undreamed of even a short time ago. The National Library of Medicine (NLM), in pursuit of its longstanding mission to acquire, organize, and disseminate health-related information, now has the opportunity to provide near-instantaneous reliable access to high quality health information resources when and where decisions are made. The support of NIH's efforts to understand and eliminate health disparities between minority and majority populations is an integral part of NLM's mission. (National Library of Medicine Strategic Plan for Addressing Health Disparities 2004-2008)

NLM has developed a framework for its minority outreach programs and is continually building upon this to develop and maintain a robust program of information outreach to minority groups ? both at the professional level and the consumer level.

Purpose

There are four major activities to be accomplished by this purchase order.  It will be the decision of the contractor to best decide the method of completing these tasks.  Evaluation of outcomes is an important component of all NLM outreach activities.

Task 1:  The contractor will work with community- and faith-based organizations to increase their awareness of NLM as a resource for medical information.  The contractor will provide training to these organizations on methods to obtain this information.  The primary goal is to promote health information.  It is not to advance any religious principles and odes not require excessive entanglement of church and state.  It satisfies the test of Lemon vs. Kurtzman (403 US 609 1971)

Task 2:  The contractor will work the NLM and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on increasing the amount of information available to Latin America for disaster preparedness.  The contractor with provide consultation to NLM on the current project that NLM is conducting with CRID on capacity development in Central America.

Task 3:  The contractor will work with minority organization and professional associations to assist in the development of partnerships and collaborative activities.  This may include attending national meetings of minority organizations with the goal of making these organizations aware of the NLM, its programs and services, including consumer health resources and job opportunities.  This may include speaking at conferences hosted by minority health professional organizations such as the National Medical Association and working with NLM staff to develop and implement meetings on topics such as minority participation in clinical trials.

Task 4:  The contractor will work with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority educational institutions to increase their awareness of medical informatics and telemedicine.  This includes serving as executive secretary of the new membership panel for the NLM Environmental Health Information Outreach Program and a member of the executive committee.  The contractor will provide input to NLM on the identification of new panel members, programming, and collaborations.

Sole Source Justification

Dr. Spann has a Ph.D. in Chemistry/Computers Systems and MS in Chemistry/Information Science and Technology and is recognized nationally as an expert in scientific information storage and retrieval.  In addition, he is keenly knowledgeable about the NLM?s information services.  Because of his expertise and experience in this area, he is uniquely qualified to work with community and faith-based organizations, PAHO, HBCUs and other minority organizations to increase their awareness of NLM as a valuable resource for medical information and telemedicine applications.  Dr. Spann has extensive experience working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and a successful track record of working with minority organizations and institutions.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations, nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  
 
The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.

AMENDMENT THREE (3)

This amendment is in response to questions received via email.

#23.	Can you tell us how many people would be participating in the workflow process?  Total users. 

Answer:	Approximately 100.

#24.	How many pages of paper or electronic files would need to be controlled with the system, either monthly or yearly? 

Answer: 	Not determined at this point. The NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Publishes approximately 810 documents each year, so there should be at least that many published documents moving through the system in a given year.

#25.	Any requirement for special reports needing to be generated by the system?

Answer:	This question will be answered at the completion of Phase I. 

#26.	Any conversion required from a current system, either paper or data?

Answer:	Data is currently stored in an MS SQL database. We are hopeful that the contractor will be able to more fully develop the existing database to accommodate the additional functionality required.  
  
#27.	SERCH operates on servers at the NIH Data Center, our assumption is you would utilize those servers. 

Answer:	This is one document management solution used at NIH, however, this would not necessarily be leveraged for this project. That question is to be answered by the contractor in Phase I. 

#28.	In response to question 20, a response was given that resumes are not counted in 15-page response. Does the 15-page limit for Technical Approach section (25 points) include Past Performance (50 points) and Experience ? proposed personnel (25 points) or these not included in 15-page count. Please clarify this.  

Answer:	Everything else is included in the 15 page count, resumes are the only exclusion.

#29.	It is assumed that cost proposal to be developed in response to section D of RFQ is not included in the 15-page count though it can be in the same document (question 16 response). Please clarify this. 

Answer:	Technical and Cost proposal are included in the 15 page count, r?sum?s are the only exclusion.

#30.	 Are there any font type, size, and margin requirements for the technical and cost sections?

Answer:	There is not.

#31.	We typically perform projects similar to the proposed Phase I on a fixed-price basis. Would you accept a firm, fixed price quote for Phase I as a way to minimize the cost risk for NLM?

Answer:	Please submit both (fixed-price and time & material). 

#32.	The page limit was addressed in Amendment 2, #20.  However, please clarify: Does the 15-page limit apply to the technical approach section only, the entire proposal body excluding Appendices, or the entire proposal with Appendices?

Answer:	Technical and Cost proposal are included in the 15 page count, appendices are excluded.

<DESC>This amendment is being modified to delete the posting of the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-120, that should have been 2005-12. The Circular no longer applies to this announcement.


This is a Broad Agency Announcement for applied research in accordance with FAR 35.016. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services (NESDIS), Office of System Development (OSD), has a requirement for on-site capability to develop Enterprise Architecture Alternatives and Enterprise Architecture Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) Studies. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Firm fixed price proposals are hereby requested under Solicitation No.  NEEK-0000-6-00279, and no further written solicitations will be issued.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541710, size standard 500 people.

Background:

The U.S. Government (USG) Department of Commerce?s (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) primary mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth?s environment, issue severe weather warnings, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation?s economic, social, and environmental needs.  This mission requires continuous capabilities to utilize our observation systems to collect, acquire, process, archive, disseminate environmental data and information, and to provide information services.  These data are acquired on an extensive spatial range (global, regional and local) within a variety of time scales (seconds to days) to meet a multitude of user requirements. These data include, but are not limited to: hemispheric imagery; cloud and precipitation parameters; atmospheric profiles of temperature, moisture, wind, aerosols and ozone; surface conditions concerning ice, snow and vegetation; ocean parameters of sea temperature, color and state; solar conditions and space environment; and global communications.  These data are critically needed for: 1) severe storm and flood warnings; 2) tropical cyclone (hurricane reconnaissance and warnings); 3) hydrologic forecasts and water resources management; 4) ocean surface and internal structures forecasts; 5) medium range forecast outlook (out to fifteen days); 6) solar and space environmental forecasts; 7) aviation forecasts (domestic, military, and international); 8) ice conditions forecasts; 9) seasonal and inter-annual climate forecasts; 10) decadal-scale monitoring of climate variability; 11) long-term global environmental change assessment; 12) environmental air quality monitoring and emergency response; 13) fire and volcanic eruption detection and analysis; and 14) short-term and mesoscale forecasts.

To meet requirements and accomplish NOAA?s mission, the current collection of observing and data systems perform three major functions:

?	Earth Observations: Measurement, acquisition, processing and dissemination of Earth observation data from the atmospheric, land, ocean and space environment. 

?	Data collection, processing, archive and dissemination:  Receipt, storage and redissemination of data from all data collection platforms necessary to fulfill NOAA?s mission.

?	Data Products and Warnings:  Continuous relay and dissemination of environmental data to distributed users, independent of other system functions.
 
NOAA?s current baseline architecture includes 86 environmental observing systems gathering over 300 environmental observing parameters. NOAA has land-, sea-, air, and space-based observing platforms and also accesses international, national and commercial data.  NOAA?s data handling systems include 59 stovepipe systems that address 23 data management functions.  Future observing system collectors will be capable of increased resolution and vastly increased data volumes will need to be archived and efficiently accessed by an expanding number of users. NOAA must also migrate from this current stovepipe environment to an information enterprise. 

Description of Requirement: 

The Government desires to research complete end-to-end system architecture options that assess the infusion of new or existing technologies that may enhance performance and reduce costs. Respondents are encouraged to propose innovative methods to meet the performance requirements and provide cost benefits.

The Proposal must address at least one of the four Task Areas, but not more than two of the following Task Areas:

1.	Task Area 1:  Assess/Score/Rank.  This task area seeks a methodology and identification of potential tools to assess/score/rank the over 300 environmental observing parameters.  It also seeks to understand the methodology that can be applied to assess/score/rank alternative architectures. 
2.	Task Area 2:  Functional Allocation of Environmental Observing Parameters to Platforms.  This task area seeks a methodology to determine the functional allocation of over 300 observing parameters to platform types, i.e., space-based, air-based, land-based, etc.  
3.	Task Area 3 ? Data Management.   This task area seeks a methodology to streamline NOAA?s 59 ?stovepipe? data management systems satisfying 23 data management functions.  
4.	Task Area 4 - Data Integration.  This task area seeks to apply improvements to the integration of environmental data from multiple sources and to streamline and improve efficiency in the production of data and information products and services.  This task area also seeks to understand methods of addressing our future enhanced sensor collection capabilities, i.e., NPOESS and GOES-R. 


Evaluation and Basis for Award:

The evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, will be based upon:


      (1) The Respondent?s performance and experience on similar enterprise architecture and        
            AoA efforts (45%)

(2)	The Respondent?s demonstrated understanding of NOAA?s missions and its user environmental observing requirements, its baseline architecture, federal and commercial information drivers and future information technology factors, and a demonstrated understanding of OMB?s Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Process (35%) 
(3)	The Respondent?s current capability as evidenced by its corporate, research, and industrial resources to produce the Proposal corresponding to the Task Area(s) (25%)

The Government requires the Proposal to address  the conceptual architecture concept/methodology, advances in state of the art technology that could be applied to the task, and performance that demonstrates the Respondent?s capability to perform successfully in the Task Area.  Respondent?s past experience in the task area should identify the contract, a current reference person and phone number, and the Respondent?s role in the performance of said contract(s). The Government?s document package is available at: www.nosa.noaa.gov. 

Offerors are advised that the Government may secure Contractors to provide advisory analyses on the Respondent?s Proposal for purposes of including a non-biased, third-party assessment from experts in the respective fields of enterprise architecture development, observing systems, systems engineering, and ground systems. These Contractors shall sign and submit non-disclosure and organizational conflict of interest certifications to the Contracting Officer. However, these Contractors shall not perform any role in the technical scoring of Proposals.  Access to Proposals shall be handled under the FAR, Part 3.104, and 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other NOAA contracts through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror, supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposals submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interests, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  This BAA is an expression of interest only, and does not commit the Government to pay any pre-proposal or proposal preparation costs

Estimate of Available Funds and Number of Awards

The Government has budgeted approximately $1,200,000 for this requirement.  The Government may make multiple or no awards of firm fixed price type contracts.

Any contract awarded shall address at least one, but not more than two of the task areas.


Provisions and Clauses:

Provisions and clauses for firm fixed price contract(s) to be awarded pursuant to this notice are those in effect for this contract type through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-120.

Offers:

Proposals should be submitted in an original and seven (7) copies. Written format: All Proposals shall use clear, readable, single-spaced type on 8 ?" x 11" paper, single-sided, unless using charts, which are encouraged where they can be appropriately used to convey approaches and methods.

Material should also be submitted via electronic media using CD media and in Microsoft Office Tools format.  The Proposal must not exceed fifteen (15) pages of narrative including charts, coversheet and footnotes, or thirty (30) pages for a multiple task proposal. Failure by any Respondent to follow these instructions shall cause its proposal to be removed from consideration by the peer review panel, and shall be construed by the Government as the Respondent having made this exclusion purposefully.  This BAA is open to commercial industry, academic institutions, and other interested parties.  

Proposals submitted in response to this BAA must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. on September 15, 2006, at the following address:

Please reference VA-786A-06-RI-0097 as the subject of your response.  Public Law 106-50, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 established a statutory Government-wide goal that 3 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be spent with SDVOSBs. In an effort to enhance opportunities for SDVOSBs and increase the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplishments in this important socioeconomic category, VA's National Cemetery Administration is performing preliminary market research to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of SDVOSBs with regards to an upcoming acquisition for Construction Services at the Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville NY.  The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for SDVOSBs, pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.5. NAICS code for this acquisition is 237990.  The Size Standard is $31.0 Million.  The magnitude of this project is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. Project is subject to the availability of funds.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:  Contractor shall provide for expansion and improvements to the Saratoga National Cemetery, Schuylerville NY, as per the contract specifications and drawings that will be provided.  Performance period is approximately 18 months or 540 calendar days from date of receipt of Notice To Proceed.  Work includes, but is not limited to:  general construction, alterations, roads, walks, 2,500 columbaria, 3,700 pre-place crypts, grading, drainage, mechanical and electrical work, utility systems, necessary removal of existing infrastructure and construction, and certain other items.  NOTE(S): 1. Bids will include alternate deducts that are sequenced as per NCA priority, and are cumulative.  Refer to bid documents for instructions. REQUIRED RESPONSES:  Your review of this information and response to the following questions will be very helpful in determining if this acquisition may be set-aside exclusively for competition among SDVOSBs.  Please review the specifications and technical requirements carefully before responding to this e-mail.  If the question is not applicable, please indicate "N/A" in your reply to that question: (1)  Has your firm, as a prime contractor, whether individually or through a formal joint venture or teaming agreement, or under subcontract to a prime contractor, provided construction services for projects of similar size and scope (Government or commercial) within the last three years as described in the brief description of project above?  If yes, please provide the following information on your three most recent projects: (a) Contracting Agency Address &amp; contracting officer's name and telephone number. 	(b) Contract Number, date and amount of award, date of completion 	(c) Description of Items/Services provided under the contract. 	(d) If any bonding was provided, what was the amount of bonding?   (e) If performance was as a subcontractor, please provide the name, address and telephone number of the point of contact at the prime contractor. (f) State whether or not there were any performance issues under the contract which resulted in the issuance of a Cure Notice or Show Cause Notice by the contracting officer. (2)  In order to determine if an acquisition can be set-aside for SDVOSBs, the contracting officer must determine that there are a sufficient number of SDVOSBs capable of performing the contract requirement and that award can be made at a reasonable, fair market price.  To that end, please provide your firm's individual and aggregate contract bonding capacity. (3)  Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.?

<CONTACT>Carmen Bernhardt Purchasing Agent 7022938601     CBernhardt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements to Nevada Conservation Corps, Reno, NV; Student Conservation Corps, Oakland, CA; SW Conservation Corps, Tucson, AZ; Coconino Rural Environment Corps, Flagstaff, AZ; and Utah Conservation Corps, Logan, UT, for support of the implementation of the LCR MSCP.  Reclamation will have an ongoing need for a labor pool to assist in various tasks related to habitat restoration. Because specific projects are not yet identified, it is unknown exactly how often this labor pool will be required, what tasks will be needed for each project, and how many individuals will be needed per task. The purpose of this contract is to establish a labor pool that can be deployed quickly when the need arises to restoration sites and/or plant collection sites where work is to be conducted without the encumbrances of issuing several separate contracts each time labor is required.  Reclamation intends to limit award to multiple, non-profit conservation service organizations.  Any other organizations that meet these requirements are encouraged to submit information regarding their experience and capabilities to meet the Bureau of Reclamation's requirements. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is on or about October 10, 2006.  Please direct any questions to Carmen Bernhardt at (702) 293-8601, or email cbernhardt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 115116, and the size standard is $6 million. For technical questions please contact Barbara Raulston (702) 293-8788, or braulston@lc.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is seeking to establish a customized training and developmental program for existing NRC staff involving facilitating meetings with external stakeholders.  The NRC primarily conducts two types of meetings with external stakeholders:  town hall meetings, where the NRC staff interacts with an audience comprised a variety of external groups and individuals to both convey information and receive input; and roundtable meetings, where the NRC staff engages a limited number of groups that might be most affected by an issue in a controlled discussion.  A formal training and certification program will be designed to ensure that all NRC staff facilitators are fully prepared to handle their assigned meetings.  The program would include one or more classes on facilitation skills specifically designed for the NRC regulatory environment, as well as other training elements, such as coaching, mentoring, and on-the-job training.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN SUPPORT OF:

 Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) Rotatable Pool (RP) Program. 
                                                                             
The General Services Administration, under a Memorandum of Understanding with the United States Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, is seeking sources to provide services supporting the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) Rotatable Pool Program. The GSA is soliciting interest for a competitive acquisition from qualified contractors.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.

This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Rather, this Notice is one market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of all potential sources, with specific interest in Small Businesses.  

The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the NAICS Codes to establish size standards on an industry-by-industry basis.  The NAICS code for the ASDS PP program is 811310 - Service machinery and equipment repair and maintenance services.
This size standard for this code is based on average annual receipts of $6,500,000.00 for three (3) most recent completed fiscal years.

The purpose of this announcement is to generate responses from Small Businesses under the NAICS set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph to determine whether the Request for Proposal should be amended as a Total Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR Part 19. 

This Sources Sought Synopsis Notice is issued immediately prior to the issuance of a DRAFT Request for Proposal.  The Request for Proposal will be published in FedBizOps on or about September 15, 2006. As stated above, if a sufficient number of Small Businesses (according to the NAICS code assigned to this procurement) express an interest after reading and contemplating the DRAFT Request for Proposal, the Government may restrict competition of the procurement to Small Businesses under the NAICS assigned to this procurement. 
     
Small Business interested in this procurement should provide a response to this Notice.  The response must indicate the level of the contractor?s interest (likelihood you intend to submit a proposal as a prime contractor), potential teaming arrangement if likely to submit a proposal, and contractor qualification information relevant to the Request for Quote.  A brief description of Past Performance information as a prime contractor or a subcontractor providing details is especially important because Past Performance is a significant evaluation factor of the Request for Proposal.  

If an insufficient number of small businesses respond, or if the responses do not indicate small businesses are capable of performing, the solicitation (RFP) may issue unrestricted, i.e., under Full and Open competition.  However, small businesses are not precluded from participating in a Full and Open competition.

Instructions for Responses.  Responses should be not longer than ten (10) pages and must be submitted via email in either Microsoft Word or PDF format.  Please use standard formatting, i.e., 8.5 x 11 inch pages, one inch margins and readable font sizes (not less than 11).   Questions concerning this requirement should be electronically sent to the Contracting Officer, Anthony W. Pellegrino, anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov, Kristine Levine, Contract Specialist, kristine.levine@gsa.gov, and Dorothy Cestrone, Customer Account Manager, dorothy.cestrone@gsa.gov.  Please limit telephone calls; however, Anthony Pellegrino may be reached at 617.565.5750.

Responses are due no later than 11:00 a.m. EST,  September 30, 2006 and shall be electronically sent to the Contracting Officer, Anthony W. Pellegrino at anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Sole Source Notice-Chimpanzee Animal Husbandry
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICIATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  NIH intends to procure animal husbandry services for chimpanzees used in AIDS and other Biomedical Research on a sole source basis to the University of TX, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77730.  The period of performance shall be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) successive twelve (12) month periods.  It is believe that MD Anderson is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements) because of the below:

The first two contracts for this requirement were awarded by full and open competition in September, 1988 and September, 1994 to the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The solicitation to contract 263-94-C-0028 was issued to ten (10) sources yet only one proposal was received which was from the incumbent contractor.  The current contract was issued under Other than Full and Open Competition to the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (contract number NO2-OR-0-4021).
	
As a result, the reasons for other than full and open competition include the need for continuity of operation of a chimpanzee holding colony including scientific continuity, psychological and social well-being of the animals.  These are highly sensitive, intelligent and valuable research animals whose well-being and value to science must be foremost in consideration during the award process.  Social housing is the most critical element for maintaining normal, species-typical chimpanzee behavior.  Stable, socially-housed colonies must be maintained without compromising the health and well-being of the animals.  Establishing compatible social groups often takes years.  The chimps on this contract are members of compatible, stable social groups that have been together for 5 to 15 years.  As groups mature, behavior staffs must use innovative methods to maintain a stable integrated research colony.  Disruption of the social structure would significantly result in undue stress with potential resultant disease, morbidity, or mortality with resulting in loss of valuable research subjects and compromised experimental data. 

The contractor has the ability to provide training, psychological enrichment, scientific support, and to house chimpanzees in large, stable social groups in an indoor/outdoor environment.  The contractor is committed to promoting the psychological well-being of the chimpanzees through a comprehensive environmental enrichment program and a positive reinforcement training program. 

Attached to this notice is the Draft Statement of Work.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit capability statements to the Contract Specialist by October 30, 2006 at 3PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A determination by the NIH not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the NIH. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Address responses to the attention of Zedekiah J. Worsham at National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 541E, MSC 7663, Rockville, MD 20852.  The NAICS code for the procurement is 112990, and the business size is $750,000.See numbered Note 22.

The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by radio controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide IED threat.  The Naval Sea Systems Command is planning to execute procurements to address these combined threats.  The DoD will first award one or more contracts to design, develop, fabricate, and test both man portable (dismounted) and vehicle mounted (mounted) Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  By incorporating technical advances over existing CREW systems, these systems will address both the urgent requirement for dismounted CREW systems in Iraq and Afghanistan and initiate development and demonstration of the next generation dismounted CREW systems.  These next generation dismounted and mounted systems will provide a technological bridge leading to an integrated system of systems.  The final procuremen!  t will integrate dismounted, mounted and fixed CREW systems into a single system of systems capable of addressing the future worldwide CREW threats.   The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to initiate procurement of the dismounted and mounted systems with a release of a Request for Procurement RFP in 1st GFY07 followed by contract award early 2nd Quarter GFY07.  Industry will have approximately a seven month development period leading to a one year Government test cycle.  The Government anticipates awarding production contract in 3rd Quarter GFY 08, requiring initial delivery late the same quarter.   Contract award for the integrated system of systems procurement is planned for 4TH Quarter GFY08 with initial delivery planned for 2ND Quarter FY12.  The DoD will provide specific details of these acquisition strategies during the industry day on 26 September 2006.   The Department of Defense is developed detailed program requirements and specifications for each of these procurements.  Basic requirements will include increased portability (smaller/lighter dismounted systems, reduced vehicle impact for mounted systems), reduced power demands, increased frequency coverage, increased modularity, increased interoperability with other CREW systems, and improved compatibility with other DoD systems.  Specific details of these requirements will be presented during the industry day on 26 September 2006.   The information provided is for information only and is not a Request for Proposal or announcement of a solicitation.   This synopsis does not constitute an invitation for bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.

<SUBJECT>--The Product Manager for Demilitarization (PM Demil) seeks industry participation in an initiative to find new approaches to the reduction of conventional ammunition stockpiles that no longer have operational utility for the DoD.
<DESC>The Product Manager for Demilitarization (PM Demil) seeks industry participation in an initiative to find new approaches to the reduction of conventional ammunition stockpiles that no longer have operational utility for the DoD.  Considerable invento ry is available which is believed to have commercial value.  This RFI is intended to stimulate responses that propose new business arrangements that would allow industry acquisition of existing DoD ammunition for reuse or reclamation of materials that may have other military or commercial applications.  Conventional ammunition is defined as a device charged with explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, or initiating composition for use in connection with defense or offense, including demolitions.  Certain amm unition items can be used for training, ceremonial, or non-operational purposes.  For demilitarization and disposal purposes, conventional ammunition also includes tactical missiles and large rocket motors.  Even though the government has an ongoing program for demilitarization of conventional ammunition, the stockpile is growing faster than inventory is being eliminated.  With the DoD fully engaged in the War on Terrorism, additional funding for standard meth ods of demilitarization is uncertain.  Therefore the Army, as the DoD's executive agent for conventional ammunition demilitarization, is interested in finding alternatives that would create viable business opportunities for industry while achieving the DoD 's objective to reduce the stockpile of conventional ammunition products that are no longer in demand by the warfighter community. To better understand the Army's initiative an 'Industry Day' will be held on 12 October 2006 at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City at Reagan National Airport, 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia.  Registration will begin promptly at 12:30 pm in t he Regency E Ballroom.  The meeting will conclude at 4:30 pm. The government expects respondents to describe contracting strategies, business processes and technical approaches for consuming or reutilizing selected demil stocks.  Responses that simply reiterate on-going practices will not satisfy this requirement.  S uccessful respondents must show innovative, non-traditional alternatives based on sound business practices that would eliminate aging conventional ammunition stockpiles and avoid the costs to the DoD for its storage and surveillance burden.  The government  expects that the contractor will accept delivery at the point of storage.  Non-traditional participants are highly encouraged to respond to this opportunity.  Furthermore, this RFI is open to foreign participation, given the State Department protocols and appropriate security requirements for export of military ammunition can be satisfied.  Responses to this RFI must be delivered within 45 days of the announcement date.  Responses to the RFI will help shape the government's strategy for disposal of these materials and any subsequent formalized requests for proposal.  Interested parties are en couraged to use the RFI to provide a general understanding of the disposal strategy to be employed, to ask the important questions that will help them decide the viability of future proposals and to inform the government of the critical elements necessary for a winning demil contractual relationship between government and industry.  To the extent possible, the RFI response should indicate by ammunition type the quantity (Specific types of munitions may be limited in quantity) desired by year, the methods of  disposal, the acceptance of liability for the material to be transferred, disclosure of any need to use government facilities in the execution of the disposal strategy, and the financial basis for the transaction. A summary list of candidate munitions that have been initially identified by DoD for disposal through this new contracting arrangement may be obtained by contracting Mr Rich Fuller, HQ JMC, Rock Island, I L email; richard.fullerjr@us.army.mil, phone number: (309) 782-6306.  Requests for additional technical data will be honored at the unclassified level and will be posted for all potential respondents to review. This is a request for information for planning purposes only.  It is not a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation.  Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.   Electronic submittals are preferred and should be sent to Ms. Chris Thompson, Procuring Contracting Officer, HQ ASC, Rock Island, IL email christine.l.thompson@us.army.mil phone number (309) 782-4345, Mr. Ryan Larrison, Contract Specialist, HQ ASC, Rock Island, IL email: ryan.larrison@us.army.mil phone number (309) 782-6214.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.   IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters.

The Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Terminating Kits, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures within the Department’s network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures and subsequent replacement of the entire warehouse stock of existing compatible items.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations. Installation teams also have connector installation kits that are compatible only with the Corning Unicam Fiber Optic SC-type connectors.  The requested acquisition is to replenish warehouse stock and is based on compatibility with existing warehouse stock and installation tool kits and methods.

Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing Panduit non-metallic raceway presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide.  The Installations Branch currently has Panduit non-metallic raceway in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation managementThe 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s network distribution system. The Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, patch panels, patch cords and accessories are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing non-metallic network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name of these products would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand name non-metallic raceway components and subsequent replacement of entire distribution systems at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide to ensure compatibility.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations. FOR THOSE LINE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT DENOTED AS BRAND NAME OR EQUAL, TO HAVE A BID CONSIDERED FOR AWARD ALL VENDORS MUST PROVIDE MANUFACTURER, PART # AND EXTENDED SPECIFICATIONS OF THE EXACT MODEL BEING PROPOSED FOR ALL LINE ITEMS. NO EXEPTIONS. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION.

Should offerors require additional clarification, contact Robin Willis-Guille at willisrl@state.gov or FedBid.com at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR>CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received at that email address no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: •	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  •	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. •	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. •	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the scanners soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment similar to the Datalogic Gryphon Barcode Scanner in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s HST Pilot/Recovery/QA project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS Purchase of Analyst Notebook and Analyst Notebook Training:  The Chief Technology Office has been tasked by Diplomatic Security (DS) to provide analytical tools to offices performing threat analysis, intelligence, and counterintelligence. The tool that will be utilized by the Bureau is an industry standard known as Analyst Notebook. Concurrent user licensees and training are being procured to ensure that personnel supporting the Mission of the Bureau have the proper tool and training to provide a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.DS/CTO/CPA has identified Analyst Notebook as a key component that enables our personnel to automate the analysis of threat and intelligence information. Analyst Notebook is a necessary technology for gathering, providing access to, and analyzing data for the purpose of helping enterprise users make better and more efficient decisions. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As this is a sole source justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s analysis function.It is also important to note that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Department has been using this tool (Analyst Notebook) for approximately 10 years.  Analyst Notebook is the Bureau’s “standard” tool for automated analysis of information. DS/EX/CTO has conducted a market survey to determine if any commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Investigative Analysis Software Tools, e.g., Analytical Tools, could satisfy DS requirements. Seven organizational entities within DS participated in the market survey by defining their requirements for Analytical Tools, evaluating vendor product descriptions, constructing benchmark test cases, evaluating vendor product performance and capabilities based on results obtained for the benchmark test cases, and identifying the vendor whose COTS products best satisfied their needs. Thirty-five (35) candidate vendors were identified as having COTS products of potential interest and were provided with a statement of the DS requirements. Eighteen (18) of these candidate vendors responded and were asked to use their tools to perform the benchmark test cases. Fourteen (14) of the vendors provided the result obtained for the benchmark test cases using their tools. These results were evaluated by DS and nine (9) vendors were asked to demonstrate their tools. Based on their evaluation of the product description, benchmark performance, and product demonstrations, DS/EX/CTO, which was one of the participating organizational entities, determined that certain of the COTS Analytical Tools available from i2 Inc. were the most appropriate for satisfying their needs.

The M249 Para has a barrel length of 16-1/4 inches.  The buttstock is designed in plastic, and contains a hydraulic buffer.  The barrel also incorporates a folding handle, fixed position gas port and an M16A2 flash suppressor.  The M249 is also equipped with a heat shield which clips easily onto the barrel and is easily removable.  The overall length of the weapon is 41 inches, the total weight is 16.5 pounds, the barrel weight is 3.8 pounds, and the rate of fire is 750 rounds per minute.  The M240B is equipped with an integrated optical feed cover and a handguard with heat shield to provide thermal protection to the operator.  The M240B has the following characteristics:  it’s gas operated, head-space and timing fixed, mean round between failure si 26,000, range: maximum 3725 meters, tracer burn out is 900 meters, cyclic rate of fire, which is operator adjustable, is: low rate = 750 rpm, high rate = 950 rpm, the muzzle velocity is 2800 ft/sec, and the slap ammunition compatibility has been verified.

(84 lbs.), Overall Length 1654mm (65.1 in), Barrel length – 1143mm (45.0 in), Bore characteristics – hard chrome line, 8 grooves, Twist and direction – 381mm (15.0 in), right hand, method of operation – short recoil; direct system; locking bolt, muzzle velocity – 2900 ft/sec (920 m/sec), muzzle energy – 16,649 joule, effective range – 18500m (± 6,000 ft), front sight – fixed, rear sight – rear sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation to 2500m, cyclic rate of fire – 450-550 rpm, fire control selection – SAFE-SEMI-FULL AUTO. 4.

Without the weapons and accessories requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.

The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons.9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  FNH, Inc. is the only manufacturer of the M2HB, M240B and the M249 Para. These items are needed by December 29, 2006.  If cannot met delivery requirement, do not bid.

It is required that the M4 Carbine and M4 magazines be purchased to support the training for agents who will be assigned to missions which could come up at any time.  This will enable DEAV to furnish the agents with the magazines and weapons they need to provide continued protection for personnel overseas.  Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while travelling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability.   The M4 Carbine is the weapon that all agents are issued once they go through BSAC.  The M4A1 Carbine has been approved by the FPRB for issuance to all State Department personnel and contractors.  The Colt M4 30 round magazine is the only magazine authorized by Colt for Government and law enforcement use.  A weapon malfunction caused by a magazine made by any other manufacturer than Colt for the M4 will void Colt’s warranty.  Other magazines manufactured by after market companies will not function as reliably as a 30-round Colt magazine in a Colt M4 rifle.  The Colt 30-round magazine is designed to work with the M4 and is manufactured under Department of Defense contracts.  There are other magazines that are marketed for civilian target shooters and are not designed for the hard usage law enforcement or Government missions frequently encounter.  The Colt M4 is utilized all over the world as Diplomatic Security missions dictate, an unreliable, after-market magazine of dubious quality and functionality cannot be used.  Colt M4 30-round magazines are the only magazines authorized for use with the M4 rifles that we currently distribute to agents.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2, Sole Source Justification. Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the magazines and weapons requested, The Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the support that is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The magazine and weapon that has been requested are the same magazines and weapons that are issued to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons and magazines to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The M4 Carbine and magazine described above are to be utilized by Special Agents assigned to missions and posts overseas.  It is imperative that the agents receive the same equipment on this assignment that they are trained on, so when faced with an unsettled condition they are able to provide the protective services required.  The vendor states that this item has a lead-time of 30 days, but it is crucial that this be treated as Sole Source since the vendor supplies genuine Colt items.  DS has verified that the request as described represents the government’s minimum requirements.Without the COLT weapon repair parts and tools requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the equipment they are trained on which is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The weapon repair parts and tools described in paragraph 3 are currently being utilized for the Karzai Protective Operation. The weapons and accessories have been requested for the agents who were trained on the use of the M4 and the M203, and are given to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The weapons and magazines requested are needed to equip the agents on what they will be expected to use once they arrive in Baghdad, Iraq.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents and DEAV armorers in the field including purchasing all new weapons to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad. (DELIVERY REQUIRED WITHIN 120 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF ORDER. NO EXCEPTIONS)

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. FOB DESTINATION CONUS It is recommended that the Department of State use other than full and open competition, under only one responsible source, to procure renewals of Citrix “Subscription Advantage” memberships for use by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Chief Technology Office.  The preferred manufacturer is Citrix Systems, Inc. This justification and approval is for a name brand justification for renewals of Citrix Subscription Advantage memberships, which provide the Bureau with required upgrades and patches necessary to maintain the mission-critical Citrix environment. The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for the Department of State, to assure that mission-critical Citrix computing and data access environments operated by DS run at maximum efficiency.  Renewing the memberships annually ensures continuation of required risk mitigation maintaining reliable operation of the Bureau’s existing Citrix infrastructure.DS acquired Citrix Systems products in building its existing Citrix information technology infrastructure.  Eligible purchased products included initial one-year Subscription Advantage memberships.  These memberships ensure DS is expeditiously advised of major changes to Citrix’s underlying product architecture and any updates to specific Citrix product platform feature sets.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and (d)(1)(B)in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development of a major system when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the DS's needs. The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.Since the Department of State already operates and maintains a Citrix environment that houses our mission-critical law enforcement applications, memberships in Citrix’s Subscription Advantage guarantee continuous receipt of priority product version updates, patches and notifications.  This integral manufacturer service significantly benefits customers; it is the only authoritative, consistent means to budget, plan and implement Citrix product upgrades.  When eligible Citrix products are acquired, Citrix Systems, through its authorized Solution Advisors, supplies the sole avenue by which to access, manage and renew Subscription Advantage memberships.  DS solicited multiple Citrix Solution Advisors to ensure the best price for Subscription Advantage renewals.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for a Radio Frequency (RF) Mass Gauge Flight Demonstration Study per the following Statement of Work: I. Introduction NASA is currently developing the propulsion system concepts for exploration missions including a near-term human return to the lunar surface, and an eventual human mission to Mars. The propulsion concepts being investigated are considering the use of cryogenic propellants for the low-gravity portion of the mission, that is, the upper stage for the earth orbit insertion and for the earth departure stage. These concepts will require the accurate, low-gravity quantity gauging of the propellants stored in the propulsion tanks to assure adequate propellant inventory prior to beginning any human exploration mission. An accurate, robust low-gravity quantity gauging system for cryogenic propellants does not presently exist. NASA has begun a technology program to develop this gauging system to a TRL of 6, through a government in-house ground test program of Pressure-Volume-Temperature and radio frequency (RF) gauging schemes, and is funding the external development of an optical mass gauging system. In order to achieve TRL-6 for a low-gravity propellant mass gauge, it is necessary to demonstrate prototype system operation in a relevant space environment.   II. Objective Cryogenically fueled launch vehicles have used and are using techniques to measure the propellant quantity in their propellant tanks during ascent, under settled conditions or during short coast missions (low-g). The objective of this SOW is for a launch vehicle supplier to conduct a Phase 1 effort to define the resources required to incorporate and demonstrate a prototype RF gauging system on a launch vehicle. The RF gauging system requires an antenna inside the propellant tank, a coaxial electrical tank penetration, an electronics box (approx. 10” x 10” x 4”), power, communication with a vehicle computer, and data downlink. III. Statement of Work A. Task Description Provide a flight-demonstration concept in which the RF gauging system can be compared to an independent gauging system on the vehicle. Discuss potential missions which could accommodate the RF gauge. Define which propellant tank (LH2 or LO2) would most easily accommodate such a gauge. Provide approximate definition of avionics constraints including power, mass, volume, communications, and data downlink. Provide a conceptual experiment timeline which also discusses propellant levels, and vehicle g-levels. Discuss operational constraints of the RF mass gauge (e.g., no gauging operations before main engine cut-off). Discuss possible risk factors involved in implementing a RF mass gauge on a flight vehicle. Provide a budget estimate for integration, qualification, and operations for flight on a launch vehicle which also broadly defines the roles and responsibilities of the launch vehicle supplier. Provide a budget estimate for re-flight opportunities, assuming no significant changes in hardware design. B. Task Format The report shall contain the following elements as defined in the Task Description:  	RF mass gauge flight demonstration concept 	Mission scenario and experiment timeline 	Tank geometry 	Avionics and operational constraints 	Propellant Conditions 	Risk assessment Budget estimates for a flight demonstration C. Deliverable Report describing the RF mass gauge flight demonstration study as described in the Task Description and in the Task Format sections above. D. Period of Performance The report as denoted in the Deliverable section must be submitted for NASA GRC review three months after contract award. A NASA GRC review of the report will follow within two weeks of delivery. The contract key personnel shall participate via telecon during the NASA GRC review.  IV. Proposal Requirements The contractor, or it’s parent company, must be a supplier of launch vehicles which utilize cryogenic propellants in the propulsion system. The proposal for the Phase 1 study shall discuss how the elements described in the SOW Task Description (Section III) will be addressed by the Phase 1 study.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation number is RFQ60068 and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.     The NAICS is 541690 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland.

A.	The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a requirement for an evaluation of the level of usage of the NIDA Goes Back to School (NGBTS) National Dissemination Campaign.   The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the level of use by requestors of the NGBTS materials.  NIDA is presently developing a questionnaire to collect this via a Web survey, and is preparing a Supporting Statement to obtain OMB clearance for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act.  To conduct this evaluation, NIDA requires the assistance of an experienced contractor to conduct the Web survey of requestors, and to analyze the information collected.

 The key study questions of this evaluation are: 1. Are the NGBTS materials disseminated being used by school personnel requestors, and by community leader requestors? 2. What has been the difference in use level in each year of the campaign? 3. Is there a difference in use level between those requestors responding to a campaign activity and those requestors who were not intervened by campaign activities? 4. What barriers to use of the materials are being reported by requestors?  The primary source information being proposed will have an inherent limitation due to memory recall, especially for the earliest year of the campaign. Secondary source information, from the requestor forms, will be used to verify information from the earliest year(s), and to determine its usability in the evaluation.  In addition, 
1.	The contractor shall conduct the information collection and analysis of the information using methodology agreed to by the IC staff. The contractor shall use all necessary methods to ensure that evaluation questions are answered based on the information collected. 

2.	The contractor shall submit, as part of the proposal, a preliminary implementation plan and briefing statement on the database, for the evaluation services to be provided based on the information provided in this Statement of Work. 

3.	The following is a list of required tasks for completion of this contract. This list is not all-inclusive. The tasks are listed sequentially; however, several tasks will be done concurrently, and some tasks will be continued throughout the entire contract period. 

Specifically, the contractor shall:

Task 1.    The contractor will present a briefing statement to the NIDA Project Officer and IC staff, on the database of the requestors and the items of information in the database of relevance to the evaluation. Based on the contractor?s experience with the database, the potential gaps in the available information will be described, a description of how the contractor works with the gaps in the information analysis presently being conducted will be provided. The contractor will provide a brief work plan to describe how the evaluation services will be conducted, and a preliminary analysis plan.
 
Task 2.    The contractor will draft a sampling plan for random sampling from the database of requestors who ordered materials in the years of the campaign. The sampling plan will include sampling of intervened requestors, and of non-intervened requestors.  Stratified sampling will be used as necessary, to ensure adequate representation among the different sub-group comparisons that NIDA will need to answer the evaluation questions. The sampling plan will be designed to yield accurate information with the appropriate representation of the population and its characteristics such as the geographic regions/socioeconomic regions that the requestors are located in. The sampling plan will minimize non-response error.

Task 3.   The contractor will conduct sample selection from the database according to the sampling plan.  Based on its experience with these groups of requestors the contractor will use its expertise for maximizing response rates and dealing with non-responses, as necessary for a one-time participation event. 
 
Task 4.  The contractor will review the questionnaires prepared by NIDA for the school personnel and community leader requestors, and make recommendations to the IC staff, based on the experience with Internet survey taking and response rates.  The contractor will finalize the questionnaires with the revisions as needed, on information from the pilot tests of the instruments and as advised by NIDA project staff.

Task 5.   The contractor will draft the email request to participate in the survey for review by the NIDA Project Officer, and will make revisions to the email request as necessary. 

Task 6.  Upon NIDA obtaining OMB clearance, the contractor will upload the finalized questionnaires into the web survey tool to be used in the study. 

Task 7.  The contractor will conduct the survey. The contractor will review the incoming response forms to track incomplete forms needing a subsequent email request, and to track non-respondents. The contractor will conduct accuracy checks for consistency in the responses and to minimize response error to the extent possible. Such items as name of requestor, place of employment, could be matched on information in the requestor forms used in the study.  Non-matches will be tracked for reconciliation. Based on the contractor?s experience with the requestor population, subsequent email requests will be sent to participants for reconciliation or phone calls will be made if a contact number is provided. Response forms with irreconciliable error will be excluded from the study.   

Task 8. The contractor will prepare the information for analysis.  Analyses will be conducted blinded and in the aggregate. Excel formats will be prepared for extracting information from the response forms, to maximize accuracy, consistency, and standardization in extraction for the anticipated quantitative and qualitative analyses. The contractor will develop a database of the survey information, blinded for all personal identification of the requestors. 

Task 9.   The contractor will conduct analyses of the blinded information. Analyses will be focused to answer the evaluation questions. Descriptive quantitative analyses will be conducted. Qualitative information will be analyzed using qualitative methods that will be appropriate for the information and relevant to the purpose of information collected.  The contractor will work with IC staff to determine the most appropriate analytic methods needed for the information obtained. The contractor will conduct the analyses. The analyses will be reviewed by IC staff and make recommendations as necessary. The contractor will incorporate recommendations, and summarize the results from analyses in a PowerPoint presentation and a final report.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to award a contract on a non-competitive basis for 100 trial licenses of Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking Software and 100 upgrades to their perpetual license along with a consultant to f ormat and install the software..  The anticipated award will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to Nuance.Com, Inc., 1 Wayside Road, Burlington, MD  01803.    Specifically, FAR 6.302-1(b)(2), s tates, the existence of limited rights in data&make the supplies&available from only once source. The Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) requires to work with Nuance Communications, Inc. in the application of DNS Medical to AHLTA.  TATRC will work Nuance and the AHLTA/Dragon Super Users Group to establish metrics to determine  if DNS makes a difference to improving medical practice, documentation, productivity, and provider satisfaction.  TATRC and the vendor will work with an AHLTA/Dragon Super Users Group currently using DNS Medical, to study the impact of DNS Medical in the  areas of: Intelligent automation Transparent documentation Medico-legal protection JCAHO compliance Incorporating best practices within documentation Toolset to make Advanced Scripting module accessible Establishing a web site to feature FAQs and instructional videos TATRC contends that Nuance Communications, as the licensor of Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical, Version 9, is the only vendor suitable to provide 100 evaluation copies of the software, and the consulting expertise necessary to integrate their product with  AHLTA.  Nuance Communications is the only vendor with the expertise necessary to meet with AHLTA users and help them write the specialized scripts necessary to voice-enable AHLTA and maximize its use.  Hiring any other company to do this work would result  in a need to also sub-contract Nuance to gain the expertise about their software.  It is more efficient and effective for the government to work with Nuance directly. Other Factors: TATRC recognizes DNS Medical, Version 9 as the most accurate voice-recognition software in the marketplace today. TATRC recognizes that Military Health System users are most familiar with DNS voice-recognition software than other brands of voice-recognition software, and are not willing to pilot other brands of software. Nuance Communications is already selling individual copies of DNS to Military Health System medical treatment facilities, using local funding, and is already working with individual clinicians to a limited extent on how DNS Medical, Version 9, can be integ rated with AHLTA.  Many military treatment facilities are continuing to buy and implement DNS on their own, but in a manner that is not consistent across the Military Health System enterprise.  This TATRC pilot initiative aims to work with selected AHLTA s uper users and Nuance to determine if continued investment in the Nuance product is worthwhile, and if so, how one might implement the product in a standard manner across the enterprise.  It is important that this pilot study be started immediately in the interest of making an enterprise-wide decision, and year end-funds are at stake. The work in this initiative is limited to conducting a pilot study, and does not address nor fund a mechanism for full implementation and training across the enterprise, which may or may not occur in the future, depending on the study results. DNS Medical, version 9, is already on GSA contract GS-35F0295M. Additional Background:  Providers are creating AHLTA notes with a combin ation of MEDCIN terminology and free text.  Many providers are using a great deal of free text to augment the information in MEDCIN and to create a more readable narrative.  Some providers are opting not to enter any MEDCIN terms and instead are creating n otes entirely with free text.  Unfortunately, the free text approach does not allow for proper coding of the note in AHLTA, nor does it allow for data mining based on MEDCIN terminology.  Currently, the A/P module is entirely free text, which arguably comp rises the most important part of the note where providers are detailing their thought processes and documenting important information regarding patient instructions and other counseling that could have medico-legal ramifications.  This module does not curr ently utilize MEDCIN terminology.  Because this is a free text module, providers are typing most of their own notes.  Often because of time constraints, providers are truncating or eliminating this section of the note, leading to poor communication between  providers.  This essentially defeats the purpose of the AHLTA EHR.  Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking (DNS) is the leading market software package that allows providers to dictate directly into a variety of applications.  Based on reports from the field cl inicians already using DNS  with AHLTA, TATRC believes that this speech recognition application would allow for very rapid and accurate documentation into all of the modules in AHLTA that accept free text input. TATRC hypothesizes that this would allow pro viders to document in real-time approximately 6-8 times faster than they could with typing.  This eliminates the need for costly transcription services or hosted dictation servers.  In addition to allowing providers to enter free text with speech recogniti on, Dragon Naturally Speaking also allows providers to create macros to automate tasks which reportedly would efficiency and productivity. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to:  USAMRAA, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD  20702, via FAX at 30 1-619-2254 or emailed to anthony.petrore@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to award a contract on a non-competitive basis for the creation of a 1 Day workshop on Natural Language Processing using case requirements, the creation of a white paper described below and presentation of same.  The anticipated award will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to Language and Computing, Inc., 11654 Plaza America Drive, Suite 716, Reston, VA  20190-4700.    Specif ically, FAR 6.302-1(b)(2), states, the existence of limited rights in data&make the supplies&available from only once source. The Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) requires Language and Computing, Inc. because:  The Clinical Information Technology Program Office (CITPO) established a Terminology Service Bureau (TSB) to meet the terminology requirements of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA). The TSB is based on a central domain-ontology called the Military Health System Core Ontology (MHSCO). With the deployment of AHLTA, there is a need to deal with the unstructured free text format of typed and dictated/transcribed notes in AHLTA.  Natural Language Processing (NLP), in combination with an ontology, is a technology proposed to extract meaningful data from the free text documents that can represent and manipulate meanings o f texts.  Ontologies provide the difference in meaning for the word discharge, such as a discharge from the nose or a patient discharge from the hospital.  However in addition to the meanings of words, grammar and logic are necessary to combine the meanings into a c omplete semantic representation. For example the word discharge can be used as a noun, verb or an adjective in the following sentences: "	The patient's discharge was at 8 AM "	The physician planned to discharge the patient the next morning.  "	The nurse gave the patient discharge instructions.  Lexicons can provide the details of the grammatical structure of each word (morphology), its part of speech, and the meaning of the word in different textual contexts, e.g. depending on the word or punctuation mark before or after it. Traditional grammar c lassifies words based on eight parts of speech: the verb, the noun, the pronoun, the adjective, the adverb, the preposition, the conjunction, and the interjection. Each part of speech explains not what the word is, but how the word is used. The same word c an be a noun in one sentence and a verb or adjective in the next as seen the example of the word discharge above.    The government seeks a white paper describing the advantages, benefits, approaches, and risks of approaches to adding natural language processing capability to TSB Ontology. TATRC believes Language and Computing, Inc., is the only company in the position to write this paper. TATRC acknowledges that Language and Computing, Inc. (L&C) personnel are recognized experts in clinical and linguistic ontologies within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP).   The Military Health System Clinical Ontology (MHSCO) was originally created by L& C with a normalized version of SNOMED CT® that was used both as a Domain Ontology and as an external terminology.    Any other company hired by the MHS to write the white paper  and conduct an assessment of alternatives would have to work intimately with L&C to understand their work with the MHSCO to date, and how it can be be enhanced by integrating Natural Language Pro cessing with the TSB.  Therefore, it is more efficient and effective for TATRC to work directly with L&C. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to:  USAMRAA, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD  20702, via FAX at 301-619-2254 or emailed to anthony.petrore@amedd.army.mil.

A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs.  Inclusion of FAM and FAH material within the search will significantly enhance the power of the search for users by providing links directly to current versions of regulations and guidance, eliminating the need to update links within the Ask Admin Knowledgebase when FAM and FAH material is reissued or reorganized, as was the case when 6 FAM and 6 FAH were expanded into three additional FAM/FAH volumes – 14 FAM/FAH, 15 FAM/FAH, and 16 FAM/FAH.   4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).  IRM and HR have already purchased 3 Metastorm modules and A/GSSI would like to purchase the remaining 2 modules that are part of the eWorks suite.  These modules will provide additional functionality (metrics and business modeling) that will work in conjunction with the previously purchased modules (Process designer, automation engine and Manager).  Since the Department of State, via IRM and HR, have already made an investment in this particular workflow project, we want to continue to leverage this existing investment rather than work with another vendor and start from scratch with another suite that would not be compatible with existing efforts.  We are also purchasing additional user licenses that will also complement previously purchased licenses and which will allow A/GSSI to work with our OIP and overseas customers on process automation.  In addition, the purchase order includes some consulting hours to help us get up and running via a rapid development mode so that we can maximize our investment in a short timeframe.  No other company sells this software.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received at that email address no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: •	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  •	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. •	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. •	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the scanners soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment similar to the Datalogic Gryphon Barcode Scanner in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation.  Response date has been extended to 15 September 2006, 3pm Alaska Time.  
1. Who is the manufacturer of the standing seam panel?  I?d like a profile of the seam itself to see if our clamps are compatible:  Action Manufacturing, Riddle and Company is the manufacturer.  As described in the specifics, the profile of the seam itself is as follows:  The first five buildings listed (Pole Barn,  Warehouse, New Bunkhouse, 4-plex Garage, 4-Plex):  "Roofs are to be covered by Snowbar system with "U BRACKETs" with penetrations,  Hidden fasteners, ribs are (1 1/2"w x 1 3/4" h) 9 1/2 "o.c. "  For Residence 1 and Residence 2:  "Roofs to be covered by Snoblox, Snojax, or Icejax System:  Norclad, exposed fasteners.  Major ribs are 9" o.c. (1 3/4"w x 3/4" h):  2 minor ribs are (1 1/4" w x 1/8 "h) between the majors.  
2. The first five buildings are single side (Pole Barn, Warehouse, New Bunkhouse, 4-plex Garage, and 4-plex).  In other words, snow retention needs to occur on one side of the two sided roof.  The last two buildings (Residence 1 and Residence 2) are double side (both sides of the roof will need snow retention equipment).  The Panel width identified for each building in the prospectus is the total width of material needed for each building.  In other words, for the Pole Barn, a roof width of 75' indicates that a total of 75' needs snow retention.  Because a snobar needs to be installed approximately 18 inches above the eve, and midspan between the eve and ridge, 75' x 2 lengths of snowbar = 150 feet of snobar (brackets, etc) are needed for this roof. 
3. Are we to design the layout of these bars based on a 90psf. snow load @ a 4:12 pitch?  Or, does the spec show only one row of SNOBAR?  The design snow load for these buildings is 100 psf.  The roof pitch is 4:12 for 6 buildings, and 3:12 for 1 building (4-plex). The prospectus is requiring two rows of SNOBAR per side of roof. The location the SNOBAR is to be installed is approximately 18" above the eve on each roof and midspan between the eve and peak or ridge.  If the panel length is 20' (measured eve to ridge) then midspan for the application of this roof would be 10'. 
4. The two (2) residences that have exposed fasteners, are they to be painted or supplied as a bare stainless steel?  The two residences that have exposed fasteners are to be painted to match the roof color. 
5. What kind of substrate do these two (2) buildings have (purlins/plywood)?  I need this to determine fastener size and type. The substrate for residence 1 and residence 2 is plywood. The plywood is 5/8" thick.

1.0	Background 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates a fleet of twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; Coast Guard HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments.  This environment accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The Coast Guard typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year.  Aircraft are inspected in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacture?s (OEM) periodic requirements in conjunction with the Coast Guard?s specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  Historically, corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft is revealed, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  All Coast Guard horizontal stabilizers are serial number tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  
2.0	Objective		
The Coast Guard?s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center or equivalent, to effectively repair HU-25 horizontal stabilizers, Part Numbers MY20331-16 and MY20331-17.  Repaired horizontal stabilizers must meet the OEM current specifications, critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  The Coast Guard requires a Turn-Around-Time of 120 days from time of material receipt at prospective contractor facility in order to prevent Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) delay in aircraft delivery.  During repair, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated.  The horizontal stabilizer must also be painted to match the Coast Guard?s current colors and paint schemes. 
The Coast Guard anticipates at least two levels of repair for horizontal stabilizers.  First, a ?return-to-service repair? would be required for horizontals that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or minor impact damage, inspection and replacement of bushings and hardware as required. This would require skin repair and hardware.  Second, ?extensive repair? would be required for horizontal stablizers that require replacement of skins, major extrusions, and fittings. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the prospective contractor technical and price proposal.  Prospective contractor may propose additional levels of service.

B.  The Coast Guard maintains all aircraft and resources in an Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  The ACMS system tracks and schedules maintenance of aircraft components and assemblies by serial number and part number. The prospective contractor's responsibilities within ACMS consist of completion and submission of the included Component Repair Record (CRR) as follows:

1. A current copy of the ACMS Configuration Report and a Significant Component History Report (SCHR) will be provided with each horizontal stabilizer. The prospective contractor shall ensure these reports correspond with the current configuration of the component. All discrepancies shall be reported to the Contracting Officer.

2. Upon completion of repair of the tracked component, the prospective contractor shall complete the Component Repair Record provided and include Service Bulletins Complied with and other maintenance performed. 

	a. One copy of the CRR with the original SCHR should be sent with each horizontal stabilizer, a copy with the invoice and one copy mailed to:  

				Commanding Officer
				USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
				ATTN: AVENG/ACMS
				Elizabeth City, NC 27909

These forms are considered deliverables under the contract.	Noncompliance with these instructions shall result in nonpayment of invoices. The contractor shall maintain a copy of each completed CRR for a minimum of ninety (90) days.
 	C.  Under a performance-based requirements contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract. The performance measures and metrics will be reviewed for the extent they are comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives, identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness, and will be tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics. The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the contractor will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.
D. Technical	
1.  Provide detailed work specifications for horizontal stabilizer ?return-to-service repair?, ?extensive repair? and any other proposed levels of repair.  
2. Horizontal stabilizers shall be painted using products that meet or exceed MIL-PRF-23377 epoxy primer and MIL-PRF-85285 polyurethane topcoats.  Aviation coatings which meet or exceed the performance and quality of these products may be substituted.
3. Horizontal stabilizers shall be painted to match the Coast Guard paint schemes, IAW ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139.
 NOTE: Color match is critical for this contract and future aircraft maintenance.  Coatings currently used by the Coast Guard are known to provide satisfactory results on aircraft operating in corrosive environments when properly applied.  
4. All products proposed for use shall be submitted with quote for performance and color match review and approval. 
5. ARSC currently applies AKZO Nobel Eclipse products to the HU-25 stabilizers. 
          The following AKZO part numbers are provided only as references for the required color match standards.  
a. Gray AKZO P/N: 666-58-6320
b. White AKZO P/N: ECL-G-46
c. Orange AKZO P/N: ECL-G-3655
E. Service Bulletins

Service bulletins are subject to change during the contract period of performance.

All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of components requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the offeror shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superseded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.
Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>TEXT FOR AMENDMENT 1:    This combined synopsis/solicitation is a Request for Quotes for commercial items and services.  It is not a Request for Proposals.  The following vendor questions were submitted, each question is followed by Peace Corps? answer:  Question:  Is this solicitation for software only or for software and services?  Answer:  This solicitation is for software and for hosting services.  Question:  Please confirm whether the RFQ is requesting that the solution be hosted by the vendor and accessed by Peace Corps users over the internet using web browsers or installed as a web based intranet solution on Peace Corps / Government servers/network?  Or, if the Peace Corps would like to see options/pricing for both options?  Answer:  The RFQ is for a solution to be hosted by a vendor and accessed by Peace Corps users over the internet.  Question:  The RFQ requires submitting a copy of 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, is it acceptable to reference the vendor?s online completion of 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items via http://orca.bpn.gov instead of submitting a hard copy of the reps and certs?  Answer:  Peace Corps requests Offeror Representations and Certifications be submitted electronically along with the other submittals required by this RFQ.  Question:  The fixed price line items requested included in the RFP are: 1. 10 Concurrent Users Plans, 2. 10 Concurrent Users Impacts and Profiles (BIA), 3. 10 Concurrent Users Notifications, and Monthly Maintenance, 4. (per month) 10 Concurrent Users Plans, 5. (per month) 10 Concurrent Users Impacts and Profiles, and 6. (per month) 10 Concurrent Users Notifications.  Items 1,2,3 suggest a ?license? model to install the application on Peace Corps servers whereas items 4,5,6 suggest a vendor hosted solution paid in a monthly service fee.  Please confirm this is what is intended by the Peace Corps for the 6 price line items.  Answer:  The Peace Corps requirement is to license the software which is hosted on off-site vendor servers and accessed by Peace Corps personnel over the internet using a web browser.  Question:  Related to the pricing of line items, our pricing model does not necessarily charge separately for the different line items indicated.  Is it acceptable to provide one price / one line item covering all of the related topics or otherwise deviate from the pricing line items suggested in order to provide pricing that matches our solution and pricing model?  Answer:  Peace Corps requests pricing be submitted in accordance with the solicitation.  Question:  The scope of work requested includes training to be provided on use of the selected system but the pricing line items requested does not include a price line item for training.  Should pricing for training be included?  Answer:  Yes, training should be included in the software license price.  Question:  In the pricing section, the quote is being asked to be priced based on ?concurrent users.?  Our software is priced differently - based on ?total number of users? ? not current users, and we also provide pricing for ?viewers.?  What would you suggest we do regarding our pricing component so we are able to be considered for this RFQ?  Answer:  Vendors may provide pricing by total number of users.  Peace Corps? requirement is for approximately ten users, all able to be logged on and work concurrently from different offices.  Question:  It appears the government is requesting a fixed price one-time price for a Perpetual License for the software modules.  Is this correct?  Answer:  Yes  Question:  In the pricing request shown, there is no separate category for the monthly hosting services.  Does the Government desire to have the hosting services fees bundled in with the monthly software maintenance fees or would you prefer that the hosting services be listed separately?  Answer:  The price for monthly software maintenance fees can include/be bundled with monthly hosting services fees.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 01 TO THE VA COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION VA-791-06-RQ-0013, AS POSTED ON SEP 06, 2006. This solicitation is amended as follows: Change solicitation to delete sentence 4, "It is numbered 791-D-06-0021."  Solicitation number is VA-791-06-RQ-0013. The Statement of Work attached to the solicitation, dated 1 August 2006, is deleted, and replaced with the Statement of Work, dated "Revised - 12 September 2006", as attached with this amendment.   The following questions and their responses are provided to all offerors: Question:  Any statistical data available regarding the number of transports performed each month?  Response: The runs range in quantity from 15 to 50 per month.  Events requiring additional backfill support are estimated at 2 to 3 times per year. Question: Is there an incumbent provider? If so, who is it?  	Answer: Ambulance Medical Response (AMR). Question:  Are the dispatch protocols available for review from USAFA Fire Department and El Paso County with regards to backfill?  Answer: Dispatch protocols are available for review with El Paso County Fire, at http://www.elpasoteller911.org/ Question:  Per Section 1.1.2, "This contract is the secondary avenue for USAFA emergency response and patient transport." Who is the primary ambulance provider that this contract will be assisting?  Answer: Currently, AMR provides 24/7 support for other base requirements. Question:  According to Section 4.1.1, Contract Manager must be "on-site" during normal business hours or available (i.e. cell phone, email)?  Answer: We removed the phrase "on- site" and now say contract manager needs to be available to the COTR or CO, via voice communication, between normal business hours (8-5), Monday through Friday, and needs to be available outside of those hours with a one hour response time, via cell phone or pager. Question:  With regards to Reimbursement - is the contractor able to file for reimbursement on every transport performed or only in regards to inactive military and civilian patients?  Answer: Contractor will only bill TRICARE for patient transports or emergency care provided to eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.&#160; TRICARE beneficiaries include military members, retired military members, and most dependents.  Retirees and all dependents may have a primary insurance provider other than TRICARE.  The contractor will be responsible for verification and billing of appropriate carrier.  All other patients will be billed through their private medical insurance provider or billed directly. Question:  What type of building is available to contractor for crew quarters? How much square footage? Computer equipment and hookups available and government furnished?  Answer: the USAF Academy Fire Chief plans to tell us exactly where the crew and ambulance will be housed prior to contract start.&#160; There are two buildings located on the flight line that he's considering.  Power and phone connections are available.  Electrical, gas utilities will be provided by the government.  Phone, Internet, and any television services are a contractor expense.&#160;&#160; Question:  I thought this was a single ambulance 24/7 and additional support as tasked but not with additional vehicles.&#160; Please verify.  Answer: Our requirement is for a single ambulance available 24/7 with additional backfill support as needed for contract requirements.  Contractor may need to provide additional vehicles and crews to meet need for concurrent routine runs, vehicle failures, or crisis situations.    &#160;&#160; All other terms and conditions are unchanged.  The date responses are due remains unchanged at 19 September 2006.
