<RESPDATE>111413
<CONTACT>Miriam J. Holst, Contract Specialist, Email holst.miriam@dol.gov
<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent Adams and Associates, Inc. (herein known as "Adams") located at 9901 Linn Station Road, Louisville, KY 40223 that will provide operation services for the Shriver Job Corps Center. The statutory authority permitting acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Center is a 24-hour, 7 days per week operation that provides essential residential (including food and shelter), medical, education, training, and career transition support to approximately 230+ residential and non-residential students. This acquisition will result in a stand-alone, cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF), completion bridge contract with an estimated award date of November 30, 2013. The proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing on-going operational services while the follow-on action is being prepared.
<p><br />Adams is the only immediate practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services by previously trained staff without causing a break or any disruption in work. The present operator has established connections and partnerships with various educational, civic, and employer partners in the surrounding communities that could be unfairly interrupted and cause difficulties for the students. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for a short period of performance prior to the competitive solicitation and ultimate contract to be awarded. Moreover, to conduct an operator transition while the requirement is being re-competed and another transition once a new contract award is in place would be very costly to the Government. Consequently, due to the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government could incur and not recover through competition, center operation services will be procured on a sole source basis as the aforementioned bridge contract.</p>
<p>For those reasons as stated above, THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Although firms can respond to this notice with a Capability Statement, the Government has the discretion to proceed with the sole source or not. The procurement will be classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 611513, Other Technical and Trade Schools. No solicitation document exists for this requirement. Parties interested in responding to this notice are invited to submit a capability statement which includes sufficient details for consideration by the Government, including costs. Responses must be emailed to: JC.Lockbox@dol.gov. THE SUBJECT LINE OF YOUR EMAIL MUST STATE: Special Notice DOLJ141A22163 Shriver JCC Operations. Responses are due no later than November 14, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. Oral communications, telecommunication, and faxed inquiries or comments are NOT acceptable as a response to this notice. Only e-mail responses as instructed above will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>NASA/NSSC plans to issue a NASA plans to issue a solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP) under the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs. SBIR and STTR opportunities are solicited annually pursuant to the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, P.L. 97-219 (codified at 15 U.S.C. 638) as amended by the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, Extension, P.L. 99-443 which extended the program through September 30, 1993. On October 28, 1992, through the Small Business Innovation Research and Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-564), Congress reauthorized and extended the SBIR Program for another seven years (2000). Subsequently, on December 21, 2000, through the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-554) Congress again reauthorized the SBIR Program. With the approval of H.R. 2608, Continuing Appropriations Act 2012, the SBIR Program was authorized through December 31, 2011. On December 31, 2011, the President signed into law the National Defense Reauthorization Act of 2012 (Defense Reauthorization Act), P. L. 112-81, Section 5001, Division E of the Defense Reauthorization Act contains the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act)), which extends both the SBIR and STTR programs through September 30, 2017. &lt;p&gt; The both Programs are designed to provide small businesses with opportunities to compete for federal research and development awards and to stimulate the commercialization of the resulting technology.	Eligible small businesses along with nonprofit research institutions as a partner are invited to submit proposals in response to the NASA 2014 solicitation. The NASA 2014 technical topics and subtopics support the NASA Mission Directorates of Human Exploration and Operations, Aeronautics Research, Science, and Space Technology Mission Directorate.  It is anticipated that the NASA 2012 solicitation will identify specific product areas within each subtopic that NASA wishes to emphasize. To participate in the NASA SBIR/STTR programs, firms must have Internet access and an e-mail address. Details can be found on the NASA SBIR/STTR Home Page at http://sbir.nasa.gov/  . Note that the NASA 2012 solicitation will be issued as a concurrent document together with the NASA 2014 SBIR solicitation.

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a contract to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center for information technology support services without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541519 with a Size Standard of $25.5 Million.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05- 70 dated September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source, cost plus fixed-fee contract for Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 5700NG updating the T-45 Operational Flight Program (OFP) Software in Global Positioning System Inertial Navigation Assemblies (GINA) to Northrop Grumman Guidance &amp; Electronics Company, Inc., 21240 Burbank Blvd., Woodland Hills, California 91367-6675 under authority of FAR 6.302.
<p>Northrop Grumman is the Manufacturer of the GINA System. As the sole designer and developer, only Northrop Grumman possesses the proprietary data rights necessary to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Such data is required for the successful implementation of the required engineering and logistics support. The GINA is a self-contained, all altitude strap-down Inertial Navigation System, and an Embedded GPS Receiver. Changes to the OFP software are required for correcting the GINA mis-compare and loss of velocity vector, improving mini-bias update capabilities, updating Magnetic Variance (MAGVAR) coefficients to 2010 survey data, and modifying ZLG plasma start Built-In-Test (BIT) preventing start-up failures. The requirement reflects the activities used to implement the required software changes. The prospective contract period of performance will be completed no later than 12 months after contract award. The estimated value of this requirement is $3,149,000.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />For subcontracting opportunities, please visit: <br />www.northropgrumman.com</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Shore Infrastructure Logistics Center (SILC) Chief of Contracting Office for Base Support and Services, COB4, has a requirement to procure hotel rooms, full food services and full use facility services for the U.S. Coast Guard Emergency Operations in the event that a Category 2 or above hurricane or other disaster hits the Port Arthur, Texas or Lake Charles, Louisiana area. The selected Contractor shall provide all food, dining facilities, rooms, personnel, management, supervision, materials, supplies, utilities (except for government installed equipment) and the other items or services necessary.
<p>The objective of this effort is to assist the US Coast Guard Port Arthur, Texas Incident Command Post (hereinafter ICP), which is a 24 hour 7 day a week operational command center. This ICP will need to be stood up in a safe location that is away from the current hurricane and potential hazards and dangers resulting from the hurricane. This facility will also need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead US Coast Guard post hurricane operations. At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a category 2 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for the eventual ICP stand up. At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation, and more personnel will be arriving. If a similar storm to Hurricanes Katrina/Rita hit the Port Arthur area, this will require that USCG MSU Port Arthur stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to the normal operations in the Port Arthur area. MSU Port Arthur will be forced to reconstitute full operations from the satellite location.</p>
<p>HOTEL: The Coast Guard requires the "first right" of up to 150 rooms, full food service and 4 conference rooms as soon as it is known that normal operations will be impossible to be reestablished in the Port Arthur area.

If the hotel is a separate building from the conference rooms, the total distance between the two may not exceed .25 miles. Parking will be needed for up to 200 vehicles.</p>
<p>CONFERENCE ROOM/OFFICE SPACE: Office space/conference rooms will be needed for the ICP to be set up and run by the U.S. Coast Guard MSU Port Arthur Hurricane Evacuation Team. The Coast Guard may require up to four office space/conference rooms (if unable to provide 4 please specify what is available and size) to house a day/night, 24-hour watch. One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 4,800 square feet and the other three rooms must be no smaller than 120 square feet. The 4,800 square feet office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 30 phone/fax lines and 20 internet connections spread out in the room. The smaller conference rooms (no smaller than 120 square feet) must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 phone lines and 5 computer lines. The Contractor must also have the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows. The facility shall be able to provide tables and chairs for at least 100 people. The 4,800 square feet conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to have 100 electric outlets distributed throughout the room. The other three smaller conference rooms must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 electric outlets distributed throughout each room.</p>
<p>This acquisition is unrestricted; the applicable NAICS Code is 721110 and the Small Business size standard is $30M (average annual receipts). The contract type is an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract (base with four one year option periods if exercised by the government) with Fixed Unit Price Delivery Orders.

The Contractor will furnish home oxygen and respiratory equipment, conduct in-home pulmonary assessments and re-assessments by respiratory therapists, set-up/complete overnight oximetries and provide documentation of patient education.  The Contractor will transact business only with the appropriate officials of VISN 1, VA New England Healthcare System, Department of Veterans Affairs, and in no case solicit services from VA beneficiaries, except to contact the VA beneficiary for delivery and/or pick up arrangements as ordered by the VAMC.

<DESC>SPECTROSCOPIC ELLIPSOMETER<br />FA8601-14-R-0016<br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes. This market research will be used to help determine if this may be a competitive acquisition, or if a set-aside for any small business program is appropriate (Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO), Women Owned (WO) small businesses). Please review this announcement, including all attachments, in their entirety. Request that prospective offerors complete and return a Capabilities Statement that describes the comparable product and its specifications as described below in Attachment 1 to identify firms who possess the capability to provide a Spectroscopic Ellipsometer and accessories capable of extracting thickness and index of refraction for single or multi-layer transparent and semi-transparent thin films or coatings. It is equipped with fully automated alignment of stage tip/tilt focus. It has a high speed CCD detector for collection of data across the full spectral range of 193-1683nm simultaneously. Typical acquisition time is 5 sec per angle. Elliptically polarized light reflects from the measurement sample and the change in polarization is measured as Delta and Psi. Delta is the phase shift between the two vector components of the elliptically polarized light. Tan (Psi) is the amplitude ratio of the two components. A model is fit to this data to extract film parameters. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) fabricates devices and uses the instrument to characterize the various types of thin-film materials AFIT fabricates.

<a href="mailto:jeffrey.pacuska@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Command (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation to identify domestic products, suppliers, and manufacturers of retroreflective materials with advanced interface and adhesion technologies that are capable of meeting military requirements for retroreflection, launderability and abrasion resistance of the near infrared patch on the uniform as described by purchase description Patch and Brassard, Identification, Infrared Retroreflective (CO/PD-05-06A, attached). <br>  <br> The U.S. Army is interested in identifying firms with products, technologies and capabilities to provide a more durable, launderable and abrasion resistant IR patch. The IR patch shall be permanently affixed to the garment and must meet the launderability and abrasion resistance requirements as described in the attached purchase description. <br>  <br> Currently the IR patches are suffering layer delamination and in turn a decrease in operational effectiveness as a result of laundering and abrasive field conditions. The abrasive field conditions are also causing the gloss finish of the patches to become scratched and matte, which hinders their retroreflective response. The U.S. Army is interested in identifying potential solutions to this layer delamination and surface marring so that an improved more durable IR patch can be issued to the solider. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army is specifically interested in information pertaining to one or more of the following and will consider all potential solutions for the incorporation of one or more solutions: <br>  <br> 1)	Alternate means of adhering the layers of the IR tape material together.  <br>  <br> The current IR tape material is used, but an alternate means of adhering the layers together is suggested.  The modified IR tape shall be affixed to the uniform with the current sewing procedure and shall be capable of passing AATCC Test Method 150: Dimensional Changes of Garments after Home Laundering for launderability and the After Abrasion test method as described in section 4.6.2 of the attached purchase description for abrasion resistance. <br>  <br> 2)	Alternative permanent affixation methods to sewing on the current IR patch.  <br>  <br> The current IR tape material is used, but the proposed method of affixing it to the uniform is one that does not puncture the film.  This affixation method shall be capable of passing AATCC Test Method 150: Dimensional Changes of Garments after Home Laundering for launderability and the After Abrasion test method as described in section 4.6.2 of the attached purchase description for abrasion resistance. Affixation methods may include, but are not limited to: <br>  <br> Removable backing: IR patches peel and stick to uniform for easy replacement if/when needed. <br>  <br> Hot air sealing <br>  <br> Glue line bonding <br>  <br> Any other affixation technique that will not destructively puncture the thin film. <br>  <br> 3)	Total replacement of the current IR patch. <br>  <br> New development of an IR tape material that meets the technical requirements as stated in CO/PD-05-06A, is permanently affixed by means that do not facilitate layer delamination, and shows improved abrasion resistance over the current material. The newly developed material must pass AATCC Test Method 150: Dimensional Changes of Garments after Home Laundering for launderability and the After Abrasion test method as described in section 4.6.2 of the attached PD for abrasion resistance. The tape thickness must not exceed 0.014-0.015 inches and must weigh between 230 and 270 grams, it shall be scratch proof, non-marring and shall not crack, melt, or lose color or infrared retroreflective properties. The retroreflectivity of the IR material shall be tested at three orientations in accordance with ASTM E810 and as described in section 4.6.1 both before and after laundering and abrasion tests. The finished end item shall not present a health hazard to the user. <br>  <br> The findings from this Market Research effort may impact future solicitations related to this requirement. This Market Research is not a solicitation as defined by FAR 2.101, and the Government is not requesting offers for proposals at this time. This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This is a market survey for planning purposes. If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents. The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the RFI. The information received under this announcement may be used for developing acquisition strategy and refining operational requirements. Capability Statements, including attachments, are limited to ten (10) pages. Any Capability Statements, including attachments, that are not submitted in MS WORD and/or MS EXCEL or PDF format will be rejected and considered nonresponsive.  Interested sources shall include information regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities.  Information should include product cost, technical information (i.e., technical literature, data and illustrations, photographs, patents), relevant company background/experience, and a sample (optional).  Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business.  Any information/samples submitted will not be returned.  If a firm chooses to submit samples, no payment will be made by the Government for such samples. <br>  <br> No telephonic submissions will be honored. All product information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Interested parties should respond by December 8th, 2013.  <br> Address any questions about this request for information to Megan Hoey via e-mail at: <br>  <br> Megan.L.Hoey.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Or the following address: <br>  <br> Megan Hoey <br> Natick Soldier RD&E Center <br> 15 Kansas St <br> Natick, MA 01760 <br>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought Succeeding Lease - Stanton County, Nebraska
<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Stanton, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4870 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4510 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 8/1/2014.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 44 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 12 official Government vehicles<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>Alternate NAICS Code:  333319 - Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing    <br>  <br> For potential sources and industry capabilities to design, development, integrate, test, manufacture, deliver, install, and manage the Stryker MTS requirements.  The purpose of this SSN is to specify the approach in which this procurement will be executed while soliciting industries' expertise in identifying potential solutions to seamlessly expand the capability of the current Stryker MTS systems while maintaining the existing systems architecture, software design, functionality, user interface, and instructor capabilities.     <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager Ground Combat Tactical Trainer (PM GCTT), is conducting market research to identify potential sources and industry capabilities to design, development, integrate, test, manufacture, deliver, install, and manage the Stryker MTS Phase IV program. The Stryker MTS Phase IV requirements consist of the addition of Stryker variants for the (Mobile Guns System (MGS), Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), Mortar Carrier (MC) and Remote Weapon System (RWS))  Part Tasks Trainers (PTT), Hands-on Trainers (HOT), Diagnostic Troubleshooting Trainer (DTT) virtual lessons program, training, and Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS).   The Stryker MTS Phase IV program will reuse and/or extend the existing capabilities of the Stryker MTS product.  The Stryker MTS product line is defined as a set of hardware and software intensive systems sharing a common, managed set of features that satisfy the specific needs of the maintenance training mission of the Ordinance Schools.  The current Stryker MTS was developed from a common set of core assets.  This common set of core assets will need to be extended and/or reused to:    <br>  <br> a)                  Meet the requirements for new and existing weapons systems maintenance training; b)                  Meet the needs and requirements of the user training community;  <br> c)                  Provide for technical refresh due to obsolescence throughout the lifecycle; d)                  Maintain compatibility with the current weapon systems; and,  <br> e)                  Meet supportability requirements.    <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI, PM GCTT has a requirement for Stryker variants (Mobile Guns System (MGS), Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), Mortar Carrier (MC) and Remote Weapon System (RWS)) maintenance trainers to support the Ordnance Schools to provide maintenance training capability for the Army's 91S Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).     <br>  <br> The intent is to provide training for maintenance personnel in system operation, symptom verification, troubleshooting, fault isolation, adjustment, servicing, and removal/replacement of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).     <br>  <br> PM GCTT anticipates awarding a Delivery Order (DO) for the upgrade of 20 Student Work Stations (SWS) and the IOS hardware for one of the Diagnostic Troubleshooting Trainer (DTT) classrooms at Ft. Lee VA, for the upgrade of the current Operating System (OS) for both classrooms, for the upgrade of the graphical capability of both classrooms while complying with the Army's Information Assurance (IA) program requirements and for the development, integration, test, delivery and installation of approximately 118 MGS DTT Troubleshooting and 27 Maintenance 3D lessons.  This DO will provide the mechanism to procure maintenance trainers that satisfy the needs of the Stryker system based on existing validated requirements.    <br>  <br> Current System Overview: The Stryker MTS currently consist of 22 student classrooms which utilize Diagnostic/Troubleshooting Trainer (DTT) and a series of Hands on Trainers (HOT) and Part Task Trainers (PTT).  The training system provides maintenance training capability for the Army's 91S MOS.  This capability supports familiarization, institutional and unit training.  The MTS provides training for maintenance personnel in system operation, symptom verification, troubleshooting, fault isolation, adjustment, servicing, and removal/replacement of LRUs. The training system provides an automatic capability to record, score, and store the performance of students on all tasks, as well as, evaluates the student's knowledge of the appropriate vehicle system's functioning theory.  The training system provides real-time feedback and scoring capability, which displays and records all the information necessary to evaluate the student's performance and understanding of the training task. The general areas of scoring include, as a minimum, the management of switches and controls, response to malfunctions, and actions required by the tasks identified in the Training Task List (TTL).  The training system also provides real time display of errors generated by student (s) as they occur during real-time scenario execution.    <br>  <br> Training is separated into two distinct categories: the Stryker automotive components and the Stryker weapon components.  Currently the DTTs include weapon modules which support the RWS, the ATGM and the MC.  The use of a weapon HOTs is only available for the RWS.  Training on the automotive system utilizes a Hull HOT, a Driveline, a Suspension, a Brake, and the Engine PTTs.    <br> The trainer operates in or supports various modes.  The modes include Lesson Selection, Lecture, Demonstration, Training, and Diagnostics.  The Lesson Selection and Diagnostics modes are operator selectable.  The Lecture, Demonstration, and Training modes are a common mode of execution but differ in how the instructor makes use of each mode.     <br>  <br> A separate Training Management System (TMS) maintains a library of lessons that can be selected for training.  From the Instructor Operator Station (IOS), the instructor can select an appropriate lesson from that library to use for training.  The TMS also provides the capability for the instructor to record, score, and store/retrieve the performance of students on all tasks    <br>  <br> Technical Requirements for New Capability:    <br>  <br> a)                  The intent of this competitive action is to seamlessly expand the capability of the current system by adding a DTT capability for the Stryker MGS lessons in 3D graphics. The existing system architecture, software design, functionality, user interface, and instructor capabilities must be maintained.  The existing Instructor and Operator interface must also be maintained.  When fielded, the instructor must have the capability to select the lessons from any TTL, new or old.  The same type of graphical user interface that is used in the trainer today shall be used but expanded to include the new DTT lessons while utilizing 3D graphics for the MGS.     <br> b)                  Upon award, the existing Software Support Environment (SSE) will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to be used as the basis for the contractor's first software development environment, developed separately from the SSE.  The integrity of the SSE must be maintained until new software can be validated and verified through acceptance testing.  The SSE currently provides the hardware, software, and documentation resources for performing Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) activities including identifying, documenting, and correcting system software faults, implementing system upgrades, generating application programs, managing databases, and providing configuration management of the training system(s) software baseline.  The successful awardee must update the existing SSE Hardware and OS and Software Support Package (SSP) and at the end of the DO must provide the resources (i.e., source code, executable code, maintenance software, data base and scenario generation tools, documentation, installation hardware, etc.) to be distributed to operational sites for the purpose of maintaining computational systems in a fully operational condition.    <br>  <br> c)                  The current operating system parameters and user interfaces do not currently meet the Army Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  As part of  this competitive action, the successful offeror shall update the current Windows XP operating system.  Regardless, the entire systems design when fielded (including the software, and hardware as necessary), must be upgraded and hardened to meet Army IA requirements.    <br>  <br> d)                 Source code and technical manuals from the existing Stryker MTS family of maintenance trainers will be provided, upon request, to the potential bidders as Government Furnished Information (GFI).   COTS software will not be provided.    <br>  <br> e)                  Maintain concurrencies with latest Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) <br>  <br> f)                   Deliveries will be to Fort Lee VA.  (Building 18030)   <br>  <br> QUANTITIES:   <br>  <br> 1)            Delivery Order:  <br>  <br> 	a)      Upgrade classroom hardware of 20 Students Work Stations, one IOS and TMS, and the SSE to allow for 3D lesson to run.   <br>  <br> 	b)      Upgrade Windows Operation System to the latest Army approved UGM Operating System while meeting IA requirements.  <br>  <br> 	c)      Develop approximately 118 MGS Diagnostic Troubleshooting Trainer (DTT) Lessons and 27 Maintenance Lessons in 3D graphics.  <br>  <br> Note:   *The Government has existing DTT lessons for the RWS, MC, and ATGM weapons to establish a baseline for the HOTs.  No DTT lessons currently exist for the MGS.  The plan of instructions (POI) for the MGS has been approved by the Ordinance School.    <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via a Cost type contract.  The Government will make award on a Best Value basis.      <br>  <br> The Government anticipates requiring a demonstration to evaluate the contractor's ability to modify the current legacy software environment and hardware during the proposal phase.  The demonstration will be a modification of an existing five step lesson.  Offerors will be required to travel to Fort Lee, VA and will be granted access to the SSE for three workdays (8 hour workdays) to make all modifications, load the revised courseware, and demonstrate the revised path. <br>  <br> ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $3.165M      <br>  <br> MGS LESSONS DELIVERY:   18 Months after Award    <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  The Government is interested in receiving meaningful feedback on the aforementioned proposed acquisition.

<RESPDATE>112613
<CONTACT>RRTO ECD THUNDERSTORM, Email thunderstorm@arl.psu.edu
<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS: Technology Demonstration Collaboration</strong>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION: </strong></p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for procurement or other acquisition proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology demonstration candidates from private industry, Government Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations and academia for inclusion in future Capability Demonstration events conducted by the Thunderstorm Technology Demonstration Program. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the warfighter by demonstrating the capability and technology in an operationally relevant environment. <strong>The application deadline is no later than 5:00PM on November 26, 2013. </strong></p>
<p>Thunderstorm is a series of technology demonstrations and other activities sponsored by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO), Emerging Capabilities Division (ECD) in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering. In FY14, the Event Focus Areas for Thunderstorm will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to detect, predict, interdict and deter-or otherwise counter-the threat of Chemical and/or Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Specifically, (1) "Deterrence" technologies should help to influence target audiences through quickly understanding local environments and populations and leveraging key influence nodes; (2) "Prediction" technologies should demonstrate the capability to anticipate threat actions using "Big Data" and fusing other non-traditional sources; and (3) "Interdiction" technologies should help to exploit C5I and develop technologies to cue appropriate response and make response actions more efficient/effective. As such, targeted technologies will include but are not limited to: prediction techniques, automated screening algorithms, persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), standoff detection, remote sensing, cyber, cargo screening, biometrics, and Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL). Technologies at all classification levels will be considered.</p>
<p>This RFI is for Thunderstorm Spiral 14-3, countering WMD in maritime pathways, planned for 27 May - 6 Jun 2014 in the approaches of the Southeastern US.</p>
<p><strong>B. OBJECTIVE:</strong></p>
<p>Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance counter Chemical and/or Biological WMD capability needs. The demonstration environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to operational personnel. The event facilitates the identification of potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet technical objectives. Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for technology developers to interact with a specific operational command and/or other Government personnel to determine how their efforts and systems may support or enhance warfighter capability need, and allows technology developers to demonstrate the selected technology in more realistic environments. Materiel solutions brought to the event shall be a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 or greater.</p>
<p>The Thunderstorm Technology Demonstration involves individual or multiple technologies and is conducted in partnership with other Government organizations. The demonstrator provides the technology to be demonstrated and the personnel for integration and installation of the system. The demonstrator operates the system during the demonstration and uninstalls the system upon completion. The Thunderstorm staff provides personnel to coordinate and assist with the associated logistics and personnel to support the technology demonstration. The Thunderstorm staff will not assist with engineering the demonstrated technology or system. After review of the technology demonstration application submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their technologies at the RRTO sponsored Thunderstorm event. Industry participation in Thunderstorm activities does not suggest or imply that Government will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>Thunderstorm Spiral 14-3 field demonstration events will be conducted over approximately a 2 week timeframe in the maritime domain near the Southeast US. Field demonstrations will be conducted with participation from DoD, Interagency, and other Governmental partners.</p>
<p><strong>THE DEADLINES FOR APPLICATION PACKAGES is no later than 5:00PM on November 26, 2013.</strong>&nbsp;Thunderstorm Spiral 14-3 demonstrations will be conducted from 27 May - 6 Jun 2014, in the maritime approaches to the southeastern continental U.S. Under the direction of RRTO/ECD, the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) will act as the demonstration director for Spiral 14 demonstrations and host the receipt of the application packages.</p>

The contemplated period of performance (including options) would begin on November 28th, 2013 and could continue through May 27th, 2014.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received&nbsp;fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<p>Basis of Contract Award</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single award Firm Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreement.</p>

<p>The E-mail and delivery address for the Contracting Officer is written below. If the Request for Proposal is mailed rather than sent via e-mail, it is the responsibility of the Contractor to meet the same deadline date as stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Interested offerors should submit a response by November 27th, 2013, 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Proposals will be evaluated and awards will be made to eligible, qualified and highly rated individuals. ATF seeks to establish cadres of instructors that can provide timely high-quality training.</p>
<p>The Government requires all vendors to be registered under Systems Award Management (SAM) before awarding any Blanket Purchase Agreement. This allows the Federal Government to use electronic payment for vendor products or services that have been received.</p>
<p>The contactor will need a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number or DUNS Number. The D &amp; B Number for this is "ONLY" for the purpose of registering for SAM the Contractor. The contractor should call D&amp;B at (866) 705-5711, and "CLEARLY" state that they are a small business and simply need a DUNS Number for the sole purpose of SAM Registration. The DUNS Number must be obtained before any attempt to register under SAM.</p>
<p>The SAM information must be reviewed and validated annually by the contractor. Failure to do so may cause the vendor to be dropped from the ATF payment system and cause significant delays in payment. Fees and interest from payment delays due to failure to annually validated SAM information are the sole burden of the contractor and will not be reimbursed by the Government.</p>
<p>Ordering</p>
<p>ATF Special Operation Division COR will contact the successful contractor to identify special events. Typically, "if known" ATF will provide lead times of between ten (10) and fifteen (15) days. However, ATF may make facilitator's availability requests with much shorter lead times, if an emergency event occurs.</p>
<p>For routine requests, ATF will allow the facilitator up to four (4) hours from the time of request to respond affirmatively. For non-routine requests, the ATF Program Manager will determine the amount of available response time allowed on a case-by-case basis and provide this information to the contractor at the time of the request. No contractor will have recourse against ATF when situations dictate instructor scheduling outside of the standard time frames for placing instructor calls.</p>
<p>Invoicing</p>
<p>Complete invoicing instructions will be included in the terms and conditions of the Blanket Purchase Agreement. However, ATF expects contractors to invoice upon completing the assigned course.</p>
<p>Note: Proposal is to be sent via email to Jim Huff, at the following email address: James.Huff@atf.gov. Submissions by FAX or mail will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Questions of a contractual nature should be addressed to Mr. James Huff, Contracting Officer to James.Huff@atf.gov, 202-648-9117</p>

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICE/COSTS
 
 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.    A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient in the nursing home and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2 RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this agreement will require a modification to the agreement.  

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
 For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
 
 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
 B.3 ORAL MEDICATIONS
 
 Oral medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from that rate.  High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
B.4 	ANCILLARY COSTS
Ancillary cost are pre-approved costs for supplies or services not identified as included in the all-inclusive rate or any other pre-authorized rate or schedule or payment for items or services provided under this agreement.  Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.  If permission is received, the nursing home must also submit the physician's order for the medication/supply, the dispensing log, the supplier and the cost charged by the supplier to the nursing home, and what the nursing home is charging the VA.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
   B.1. This Basic Ordering Agreement shall be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care shall be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, X ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA shall include the cost of medical care, drugs, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
 
   B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
 
   B.3. Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
   B.4. If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility shall arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days shall be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility shall include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
 
   B.5. the VA facility shall approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions shall be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
 
   B.6. Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
  
 B.7.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this BOA dies, the nursing home shall within 48 hours notify the VA office  authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA.
 
   B.8. It is agreed that VA shall have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
 
   B.9. The nursing home shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this BOA for any person determined eligible by the VA Under Secretary for Health or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting shall not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
 
   B.10. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA shall provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
 
   B.11. All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home shall be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records shall be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records shall be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient that includes at least the following:
 
     B.11.1. Admission identification record.
 
     B.11.2. VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care, or State-approved referral form.

VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2 RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.

 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
 B.3 ORAL MEDICATIONS

High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
B.4 	ANCILLARY COSTS

Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.

If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <BR> <BR>(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor?s obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause? (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service.

<DESC>Intelligence analysts often rely on facial images to assist in establishing the identity of an individual, but the sheer volume of possibly relevant video and photographs can be daunting.  While automated face recognition tools can assist analysts in this task, current tools perform best on well-posed, frontal facial photos taken for identification purposes.  Janus aims to fill this gap by developing tools and techniques to significantly improve the performance of face recognition on unconstrained video and photos.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IARPA seeks dramatic improvements in unconstrained face recognition by funding rigorous, high-quality research drawing on a variety of fields to develop novel representations to encode the shape, texture, and dynamics of a face, and new ways to use these techniques for faster and more accurate search and retrieval.  Instead of relying on a "single best frame approach," these representations shall make use of all available imagery.  The program will conduct empirical testing of recognition performance across datasets.  The program must also deal with ambiguities and uncertainties due to incomplete data and partial representations.</p>
<p>Janus will consist of three phases over four years.  During the first 18-month phase, performers will demonstrate that a representation encodes the shape, texture, and dynamics of a subject's face, is discriminative over large subject bases, and can be created using multiple views of a subject.  In the second 18-month phase, performers shall quantify how both the quality and quantity of subject media impact the creation and recognition performance of Janus representations.  In the final 12-month phase, performers will demonstrate recognition performance over more diverse media and demonstrate faster retrieval approaches to searching through very large media collections.  Through all three phases, performers will be provided increasing quantities of imagery under progressively more challenging conditions.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates three WP-3 Lockheed Orion (WP-3)aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these WP-3 Lockheed Orion aircraft will be based out of the Halifax, Canada area to be operated in support of critical winter storm/ocean wind related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Halifax area, it is necessary that the P-3 aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period January 21,2014 through February 21, 2014. The hangar will protect the aircraft and it's instrumentation from the environment as well as protects the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />NOAA WP-3 aircraft will be operating out of Halifax, Canada in support of winter storms/ocean winds research. There will be several NOAA WP-3 mechanics in Halifax supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one WP-3 will be required in the hangar.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) WP-3 having a wing span of 100 feet, length 116 feet and 39 feet high at the tail. Note that the aircraft is equipped with a 105 inch (8.75 ft) air chemistry nose boom sensor that extends from the forward fuselage and must be taken into <br />account for both hangar length and towing operations. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a <br />day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security Clause 1352.239-72 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) AC and DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle and driver for aircraft movement in and <br />out of hangar.<br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, <br />consumables, phones, hi-speed internet access <br />(non-dial up with at least a 1 Mbps download/upload <br />speed), heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment <br />5 ft. x 5 ft.,<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of <br />incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from January 21, 2014 through February 21,2014. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than February 21,2014. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. <br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The following are additional instructions to Offerors:</p>
<p>The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. <br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical capability<br />All quoters shall provide a technical proposal to include how the offeror will perform the contract in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS), which shall include all certifications and stated requirements. The Technical Proposal shall be as specific and complete as to clearly demonstrate to the Government that the offeror has a thorough comprehension of and capabilities to perform all aspects of the solicitation requirements. Statements that the quoter understands the requirement and can or will comply with the requirements will be considered in adequate.<br />Quoters whose technical submittal are rated "Unacceptable" will be rejected and removed from further competition.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Past Performance</p>
<p>The quoter shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts within the past three years prior to the solicitation closing date that is the same as or similar to, the scope and magnitude of the work described by this solicitation.</p>
<p>To demonstrate its past performance, the quoter shall identify up to two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years, and provide any other information the quoter considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Quoters should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. If subcontractor past performance is provided as part of the two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts, the subcontractor past performance will be given weight relative to the scope and magnitude of the aspects of the work under the solicitation that the subcontractor is proposed to perform. Therefore, the quoter's past performance submittal shall detail clearly the aspects of the work in the solicitation that the subcontractor is proposed to perform.<br />The quoter shall complete a "Past Performance Information Form" for each reference submitted. The form is Attachment 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government reserves the right to consider past performance report forms received after the due date of the solicitation and to contact references for verification or additional information.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price<br />Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. The quoter shall provide sufficiently detailed information as to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price. Prices for all line items in the schedule above shall be provided. Price quotes shall be held firm for sixty (60) days.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers. Award will be based on low price technically acceptable, after which no other offers will be evaluated.<br /><br />Factor I- Technical capability - The Government will evaluate the quoters technical submission to determine compliance with the Performance Work Statement. The technical submissions will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Acceptable is defined as meeting the government's requirements and Unacceptable is defined as not meet the government's requirement's. If a quote's technical submission is determined to be Unacceptable it will no longer be evaluated or considered for award.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance Acceptability: The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the quoter's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the quoter's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Past performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis in accordance with the ratings and description outlined in the table below:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully provide requested support services, or the quoter's performance record is unknown (See note below).<br />Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully provide the required support services.</p>
<p>Note: Quoters lacking relevant past performance history or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorable on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendor's Past Performance is "unacceptable," that vendor's entire submittal will no longer be considered for further competition or award.</p>
<p>Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last 5 years, will not be considered. In addition, performance data will only be assessed for those references demonstrating at least 1 year of completed performance prior to the closing date of the solicitation.</p>
<p>There are two (2) aspects/subfactors of past performance evaluation:</p>
<p>(1) Relevancy - The agency will evaluate the quoters past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the quoter is to the effort to be acquired. In establishing what is relevant for this acquisition, consideration has been given to those aspects of an quoter's contract history that give the greatest ability to measure whether the quoter will satisfy the current procurement. Evaluation aspects of relevancy will include similarity of scope and magnitude.</p>
<p>Scope: The measure of the similarity of the scope of the solicitation and the contracts submitted by the quoter.</p>
<p>Magnitude: The measure of the similarity of the dollar value of the supply that exists between this requirement and the quoter's references. Magnitude will be evaluated on the dollar amount supplied under the contract(s)/order(s) during the relevant five-year period established by the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Quality - Each past performance reference under each quoter's Past Performance quote that is found to have at least some relevance to the requirement will be evaluated to determine the quality of the quoter's performance under that reference. In order to verify past performance information and determine the quality of the past performance quote, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and may collect information through questionnaires (Past Performance Report Form), telephone interviews and existing data sources to include but not limited to PPIRS. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance. The quality evaluation will be based on the following sub factors: Quality, Timeliness, and Contractor Responsiveness which will be of equal importance.</p>
<p>Factor III - Price - Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a). Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar services, sales history for the same or similar services, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 2 years final training date.<br />FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract</p>
<p>(a) Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 10 days of training start date; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 20 days prior.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200018 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-70.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is a sole source requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation (AEC) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AEC is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.    

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-14-Q-200018 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.




Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to LONDON.C.VENZON@uscg.mil. Ship POC ENG4 DAVID SLOBOJAN (808)842-2865 . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1400 Pacific Time on 18NOV 2013.</p>

<DESC>The requirement is to establish a business application-mapping tool that provides the capability to discover and provide visualization of business service interactions and dependencies for both stand-alone hardware operating environments (hosts) and virtual operating environments (VOE) (hosts) in both mid-tier and mainframe environments.  The environments the solution must discover to build business application maps includes Windows and Linux (and VMware Windows and Linux VOEs), Solaris (and Logical Domains (LDOMs), containers and zones), Hewlett Packard Unix (HP-UX) (and Integrity Virtual Machines (IVMs)), IBM Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) (and Logical Partitions (LPARs)), IBM System z operating system (z/OS) (and LPARs, Virtual Machines (VMs), and Linux VMs) as well as communications and storage dependencies.  The solution will provide the capability for DISA to visualize interactions and dependencies of components, in the tool and in an extract, for all business services on both the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) production environment, the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) production environment and on DISA's out of band network.  This visualization will allow DISA to ensure outages or service issues are addressed quickly and effectively.&nbsp; <br />

<DESC>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether the tasks will need to be completed in order.  The answer is not necessarily; the order and schedule will be confirmed with the Grantee in the kick-off meeting.<br />
<p><br />USTDA has received inquiries as to whether there is a preferred length (number of days) for the kickoff meeting and training workshop in Task 6 and the final workshop in Task 9.  The answer is no. Where unstated, the assumption is that each event is one day. However, it is up to the Offerors to propose the ideal approach.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding any restriction in the RFP that would prohibit funds being used to pay the travel, lodging and/or food for government employees (such as state/local air quality management professionals).  The answer is no, there is no such restriction. State and Local air quality officials would be potential speakers/technical experts for the project, and project funds could cover their travel expenses.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries asking for clarification on the following statement:  "A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S.&nbsp;individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question."  In response, to be considered a U.S. firm, the firm must conform to A or B, but not both.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether subcontractors who only recently became independent contractors after having worked previously for air quality planning and management agencies would be able to use their experiences at the agencies as acceptable project references.  The answer is yes.</p>
<p>USTDA is making this information available for the benefit of all prospective bidders. The response date for this RFP remains 4:00 PM local (Nanjing) time on November 28, 2013.</p>

The ACC APG is conducting market research to identify possible sources to produce systems that meet the technical performance requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification.   <br>    <br>  This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Part (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal.  This notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) in support of market research.   All information received will be used for planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.  <br>    <br>  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is an improved version of the AN/TPQ-49.  It provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 has improved range and accuracy for mortars.  It is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is assembled and emplaced on or off the vehicle by a two person team.  Interoperability and other performance requirements are delineated in the system Performance Specification.   <br>    <br>  The Army is preparing to enter the second ordering period of Contract W15P7T-13-D-C702, a three-year fixed price (FP) production contract awarded in July 2013 for LCMR AN/TPQ-50 production representative assets and initial spares.  The contract also includes cost plus provisions for support; engineering analysis; and assessment and implementation of potential product improvements.  Eighty-one (81) systems were acquired under the first year. There are currently no plans to procure more than 138 LCMR AN/TPQ-50 systems during the period of performance of this contract.  The Government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package (TDP) for the LCMR AN/TPQ-50.  <br>    <br>  Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper.  At a minimum, the white paper shall provide a description of the technical approach and a statement on the ability to meet these key attributes:  <br>    <br>  a.	Schedule.  Base contract award occurred in FY13, with ordering periods spanning FY 13, FY14 and FY15.  The Government desires system deliveries, including spares, to begin within 12 months of the respective orders and to be completed within 12 months of the respective initial delivery date.  Quantities for the additional ordering periods will vary depending on available funding and other factors.  Provide sufficient supporting documentation, to include an integrated schedule showing key events such as contract award, any development and/or facilitization, ramp up, test events and deliveries.   <br>    <br>  b.	Technical Performance.  Summarize the current, demonstrated capabilities of any existing system that is relevant to the requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification.  Information should include description of products that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above and should include sufficient documentation to support any claims that the system performance will meet the performance capabilities articulated in the LCMR Performance Specification.  Also identify any areas where current systems do not meet these performance capabilities and what steps, if any, would be required to more fully meet the performance capabilities.  Documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support claims.  Responses may discuss types, extent, depth and breadth of analysis and data to substantiate performance claims.

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span>

<DESC>FBO DESCRIPTION
The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN/NCO 21, Veterans Affairs Pacific Islands Health Care System (VAPIHCS) requests Professional Engineering Services (PES) for Construction Support Services for the Facilities Management and Engineering Services (FMES) department located at 459 Patterson Road, Honolulu, Hawaii 96819. The VAPIHCS will utilize PES construction and project managers to recommend or manage processes over the project regardless of the project delivery method used. The Construction Manager will assume the position of a professional guide or extension of staff to the customer agency. The Construction Manager will assist the agency to identify which delivery method is the best for the project. The construction management approach utilizes a firm (or team of firms) with construction, design and management expertise to temporarily expand the customer agency's capabilities, so that they can successfully accomplish their program or project. The Construction Manager also provides expert advice in support of the customer agency's decisions in the implementation of the project. 
IAW FAR Part 8, Required Sources of Supplies and Services, VISN/NCO 21 has utilized the Federal Supply Schedule FSS/GSA (FAR Subpart 8.4) to fulfill this service requirement. GSA has identified the use of Professional Engineering Services (PES), which does not include architect-engineer services as defined in the Brooks Act and FAR Part 2. PES does not include design or construction services as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36 and Part 2. PES does not include Davis-Bacon Act work as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 22.4.
