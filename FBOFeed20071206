<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Please read the entire Market Survey carefully. The Federal Aviation Administration has a requirement for professional services covering such areas as engineering support for; Wide Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS), Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) plus ground based navigational systems, airport lighting systems, logistics, business and material management. Examples include; technical support services to assist the Navigation Service Directorate in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, and sustainment of various navigation, landing and lighting systems and the transition to an integrated ground-based and space-based navigation system architecture plus anticipated NexGen requirements. The Navigation Services  and branches are responsible for the assessment, procurement, and installation and decommissioning of the electronic, and visual aids that are used to provide guidance to aircraft that operate in the National Airspace System (NAS).  This includes the navigation aids used by aircraft while flying from airport to airport and the landing aids that provide aircraft with the proper glide angle and alignment with the runway centerline while landing at an airport.  These aids can be ground based as well as satellite based.  Much of the ground based equipment, both electronic and visual, has been in use for many years.  The FAA is aggressively pursuing programs to modernize the navigation and landing service, by constantly striving to improve the systems that are critical to the aviation community.  New technology is being incorporated to enhance reliability, maintainability, integrity and accuracy. The engineering support services provided under this contract will include, but not be limited to, program acquisition planning, design engineering verification, financial planning, scheduling, documentation development, documentation analysis and reviews, procedural activities, system deployment,  system installation operations research and analysis, and decommissioning activities. The FAA anticipates that the effort will require 50,000 labor hours a year in various professional, and technical types of activities and 40,000 labor hours in non-technical/engineering types of activities, such a business/program management,  analysis, configuration management, logistics, database management and other similar activities. Examples of requirements are attached as Attachment B. All interested parties are advised the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. At this time, the nature of a future competition has not been determined. In accordance with paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 of the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), this market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition would exist if this acquisition were set aside for eligible Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business or for eligible socially and economically disadvantaged business under the Small Business Administration's 8 (a) Program or other socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these efforts are , 541611,  and 541990 size standard $6.5 million  Interested firms are also asked to submit the attached Business Declaration form (Attachment A) and a copy of the 8 (a) or Service Disabled certification (if applicable).  Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified firms to respond to this survey may result in a competitive procurement open to all businesses. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors: 1.	Capability Statement - This document should identify past performance references for the last 3 years for work performed of a similar type.  (Limited to 5 pages) 2.	Sample Resumes - These should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel. 3.	Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 4.	If respondent is an eligible 8(a) or Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) respondent. 5.	Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. 6.	If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.

No type font less than 12 point may be used. Responses must be received no later than 1:30 PM local time 45 days after publication of this announcement.

Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Rick Fenton / 448 CBSG/PKB, (405) 734-8779, richard.fenton@us.af.mil. Qualification Requirements: To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be approved sources. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION.  Potential sources are not to utilize intellectual property of third parties without appropriate authorization of the intellectual property owner.  Potential sources are cautioned that no part of the government property qualification requirement is intended to endorse or encourage the improper use of intellectual property developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer or any other third party.  The Government is not required to delay contract award to review pending Source Approval Requests (SARs). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs as soon as possible. If the Government has not completed review of the SAR when the contract is awarded, the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible Source Approval for future awards.  If an offeror's SAR package is approved, and since a first article will be required, the solicitation will be amended to include first article line items and clauses. For qualification information or source approval request, please contact OC-ALC/SB (405) 739-7243. To receive Government drawings, FEDTEDS registration is required.  NOTE:  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from the offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose for the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program manager or the contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendation to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Notes 22, 23, and 26 apply. Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 325211with Size Standard of 750.  The items specified above represent a follow on to previous contracts with Hartigg Industries and specifications or drawings are not available to the Coast Guard.  The purposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. 
Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, intends to resolicit a current contract with the Regents of the University of California to continue the study of disease and disability onset in an old age cohort established in the Health ABC Study.  This is a unique scientific opportunity to take advantage of an established epidemiologic cohort on which extensive data has been obtained.  This opportunity also takes advantage of the research study management infrastructure, such as specialized data entry, quality control, and data management systems developed to support the data collected in the study, already developed in the existing Health ABC Coordinating Center contract (N01-AG-6-2106) with University of California, San Francisco.  The key elements of this project include:  twice yearly phone interviews of functional and cognitive status performed with the same telephone instrument used in the ten years of the study; continued ascertainment of disease and disability endpoints and continued adjudication of cause-of-death; and maintenance of the biorepository.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 2539(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition makes competition unfeasible for this resolicitation.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis service for Dct-tTA Tetracycline Activator Mouse Line by Hprt Quick Knock-In Technology with GenOway; Avenue Jean Jaures 181; Lyon, France.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

The purpose of this requirement is to obtain services, more specifically, the vector, Hprt Quick Knock-In technology, to allow the NCI to continue work in progress with a Dct-tTA transgene, used to generate transgenic mouse models with a pronuclear microinjection technique.  

GenOway is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the patented vector, Hprt ? quick knock-in technology, which takes advantage of a standardized approach with an already available Hprt knock-in vector.  The use of this vector shortens development time and renders the frequency of recombination more predictable.  In order to be able to expand and complete the ongoing research using this technology, the Hprt quick knock-in vector must be compatible with on-going experiments.  In addition, GenOway provides both; traditional murine knockout and knock-in technologies as well as quick knock-in approaches to generating transgenic models through recombination with a neutral gene locus.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current research in progress.

The result of such technology is expected to yield new information through studying the effects of regulated gene expression controlled by Dct.  In addition, the information NCI has obtained about the expression pattern delivered by the regulatory region of Dct, from the existing Dct-tTA line developed by the NCI, strongly suggests that the introduction of the Dct-tTA transgene by knock-in technology, to a neutral locus, will yield a transgenic model with the desired expression pattern for the ongoing research at the NCI. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 am ET on December 20, 2007.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference NCI-80016-NG on all correspondence.

Requirements for the USDA/NASS Arkansas Field Office Telephone Communication Office Space Expansion

Background & Objective:

The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) Arkansas Field Office located at 10800 Financial Center Parkway, Suite 110, Kirkpatrick Plaza, Little Rock, Arkansas is discontinuing its current Data Collection Center, and building a whole new space for this part of the office.  It has a requirement for a telephone system for the expanded office space located on the second floor (above the current office space). 

Scope:

The contractor shall install the telephone communications necessary to establish a voice communication with the downstairs as well as with the rest of the United States.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The time for receipt of proposals is extended until 2:00 PM EST January 4, 2008. 
_________________________________________________________

The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

The Offeror shall describe in sufficient depth their ability to provide the items identified in Section B and Section C, compliant with the solicitation.  Discussion shall address conformance to the statement of work and all other parts of this solicitation.  At a minimum, ensure your proposal addresses the following criteria (Offerors shall submit documentation that provides evidence of the evaluation criteria below that is in the relative order of importance, Technical being the most important): Business Volume Content. Offerors shall be required to provide price information for the 60mm/81mm Mortar Cannon Assemblies as delineated in the RFP and past performance information (as indicated below) in their Business Volume. Past Performance. The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance. In this context, ?Offeror? refers to the proposed prime contractor and all proposed major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing critical hardware or whose subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price.  In either case, the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors will be assessed individually and the results will then be assessed in their totality to derive the Offeror?s Past Performance rating.   The Past Performance and Price sections shall ensure that all elements of the Schedule of Supplies, and appropriate representations and certifications are completed.

Understanding and Approach (Technical Capability)   Demonstrate an understanding of the management and technical requirements of the 60mm/81mm Mortar Cannon Assemblies program. The respective sub-factors should be discussed so as to offer an integrated solution that articulates the Offeror?s approach to the 60mm/81mm Mortar Cannon Assemblies program.  Management techniques, controls, subcontractor and vendor management, quality provisions, and overall ability to accomplish an integrated business strategy that provides assurance of consistent quality support are essential. FAR 52.212-2 shall be incorporated in the Solicitation.  The specific attributes (factors), used to determine technical capability, and which will therefore be utilized to evaluate proposals received in response to the solicitation, are included in the 60mm/81mm Mortar Cannon Assemblies Statement of Work (SOW). The proposal shall identify a suitable level of technical understanding of the issues affecting the 60mm/81mm Mortar Cannon Assemblies program.  The Offeror should present a cohesive approach, sufficiently backed by quantifiable evidence of their capability to execute the management and business strategy set forth in their solution within acceptable risk constraints. The subfactors to Technical Capability are listed below: a.	Manufacturing Approach and Processes  b.	Manufacturing Capability, Production Flexibility, Ability to Meet Delivery Dates c.	Quality System Plan  d.	Statement of Work and Proposal requirements Factor 2.  Past Performance Demonstrated performance history employing management and technical capabilities similar to those required to perform all phases of the program as defined in the solicitation.   Past Performance Reference Matrix.   The Government will conduct a past performance assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recentness of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. When assessing past performance, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the offeror and its proposed major subcontractors as it relates to all solicitation requirements.  These requirements include all aspects of schedule, performance and supportability, including the offeror?s record of: 1) conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship; 2) adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; 3) ability to resolve technical problems quickly and effectively; 4) quality of product as reflected by returns of product to the vendor for repair; and 5) business-like concern for the interest of its custome!  rs. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low past performance rests with the offerors. The Government will evaluate the past performances of each DoD contract to determine which will be able to complete the task at hand most proficiently.  Past Performance is a measure of how well an offeror has satisfied its DoD customers in recent works, and complied with Federal, State, and Local laws and regulations.  The government will take into account any past work experiences that are related to this task as well as any key personnel who have relevant experience.   Provide credible examples of past performance occurring within the past two years for all DOD contracts.  Past performance is based on the offeror?s ability to substantiate credible examples of relevant past performance associated with their offering.  Offerors with no relevant past performance should indicate this in their proposals.  Offerors with no past performance will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Offerors shall provide a Past Performance Reference Matrix with accurate and concise information for each reference, including: ?	Title of contract, contract number, sponsoring organizations ?	Name, mailing address, and telephone numbers for the tech POC and contracting officer ?	Type of contract, contract value, award, and completion dates ?	Brief description of the services performed, problems identified, and corrective action taken, awards/recognition received. Past Performance Questionnaire:  The SSAC will provide a Past Performance Questionnaire to selected references cited in the Offeror?s Past Performance Matrix.  Therefore, it is essential that Offerors provide accurate information to the evaluation panel.  Incorrect information provided in the Matrix will be noted and the Government will not take extraordinary measures to verify accuracy.  Offerors are advised to take steps to ensure that individuals identified as references are aware of the fact that they have been so identified, and that their attention to completing the questionnaire is essential.  The Government may use information from sources other than those identified in the proposal to develop evaluations of the Offeror?s past performance. Price: Price will be evaluated but not rated.  Price will be evaluated by the SSAC.  A proposal may be deemed unbalanced if the pricing methodology illustrates unreasonable variances in the establishment of the unit, or quantity price ranges.  An offer may be deemed unbalanced if the mathematical approach is unreasonable.  As such, an offer, inclusive of all options may have the lowest evaluated price, however, the Offeror?s methodology used to arrive at the price may not be in the best interest of the Government.  Offers that are materially unbalanced, unrealistically low, or otherwise not in the Government?s best interest may be rejected.  In evaluating price, the Government reserves the right to consider life cycle costs, which include but are not limited to O&M.  The Government shall evaluate the Offeror?s proposed price, at both the contract line item level, and as a total proposed price, to determine if the offered price is reasonable.  All dollar amounts provided in proposal!   summaries shall be rounded to the nearest dollar.

<DESC>1.  THE CLOSING DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL THURSDAY, 13 DEC 07. The U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requests information from companies currently developing unmanned aircraft systems on the capabilities and technical maturity of your system(s).  Interested firms have the option to submit approaches to either one, two, three or all four of the UAS platforms described below.  Given the wide variety of harsh environments in which Special Operations Forces (SOF) must operate, SOF equipment requires critical design characteristics that are resistant to the potential detrimental effects of environmental conditions.  The intent of this RFI is to determine the readily available UAS capability  to withstand operations in maritime and/or austere environments.  Intended system employment is from maritime platforms to the extent that the UAV will withstand repeated landings in both fresh and salt water.  Details and requirements are listed below.
2.  This Request for Information is issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is there any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. No responses received will be used as a proposal.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  
3.  USSOCOM interest will be dependent on the results of the RFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and USSOCOM operational requirements analyses and determinations.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.  Potentially, future purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain systems to perform more extensive evaluation.  Pending funding levels and the availability of technical mature systems, USSOCOM may procure up to approximately 40 Tactical 1-Micro (T1-M) systems, 80 Tactical 1?Small (T1-S) systems, eight Tactical 2 (T2) systems, and/or eight Tactical 3 (T3) systems to operate in maritime and/or austere environments commencing late FY08 through FY10.
4.  Broad industry participation is desired, but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production (delivery within six months).  Firms interested in providing the UAS capabilities described must illustrate succinctly in a white paper how their system(s) can meet the following capabilities: (1) how it can meet the required system capabilities, anticipated delivery timeframes and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) system cost estimates; (2) any recent and relevant past performance information illustrating fielded products designed and proven to work in the demanding corrosive seawater environment.  Special emphasis should be highlighted of systems capable of landing in and floating on water surfaces.  Contractors shall include relevant contract numbers, periods of performance, dollar value, corporate and reference points of contact, telephone numbers, and a synopsis of the work performed that is relevant to meeting the stated requirements; (3) current facility security clearance as approved in existing contracts or, if necessary, describe how required facility clearances for handling and working with unclassified controlled items would be established/maintained; and (4) current business size, a statement of capabilities, including available personnel; and a point of contact by name, address, and phone number.  The white paper response is not to exceed ten (10) pages.
5.  Interested firms are invited to submit their capabilities requirements, in writing, ON THURSDAY, 13 DEC 07, no later than (NLT) 2:00 PM local time to the Procurement Contracts Officer (PCO), Ms. Kim DeBois Sousa.  White papers must be sent to:  HQ UNITED STATES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND, ATTN: SOAL-KW (Kim DeBois Sousa, PCO), 7701 Tampa Point Boulevard, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621, or e-mailed to: deboisk@socom.mil.  Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in a timely manner to the PCO.

As part of the research component of USGS earthquake studies in the US, with plans to collect seismic reflection data that will image geologic structures in earthquake-prone areas of major urban centers of the US. Such studies will address both scientific questions of long-term deformation processes and provide needed inputs for earthquake hazard assessment products. In order to conduct these experiments in an efficient and cost-effective manner, the USGS requires the expertise of staff and use of equipment belonging to the NEES equipment facility at the Geotechnical Center at the University of Texas at Austin (UTA). In particular, the experiments require the use of their mini shaker truck, and the associated equipment and personnel required to operate it. Their equipment is unique and the experiment cannot be conducted without it. The experiments will be conducted in three areas of the US at to-be-determined locations within the New Madrid seismic zone in Arkansas, Santa Rosa, Calif., and Seattle, Washington.   All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist, if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.

The NIAID intends to award a cost-reimbursement contract for a one-year period of performance on or about 04/01/08.  The contract will also contain the provisions at FAR 52-217.8 for the consideration of two additional option years of performance.  This announcement is specifically for small businesses.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to include all NASA Centers (NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.; Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA; Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH; Goddard Space Flight Center; Greenbelt, MD; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA; Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX; Kennedy Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, FL; Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA; Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL; Stennis Space Center, Stennis Space Center, MS) on an existing NASA/JSC purchase order for Global Intelligence/Travel Risk Management Services.  Global Intelligence/Travel Risk Management Services involves providing a comprehensive range of services that address NASA?s travel security risks and provides timely solutions for travel security and safety.  In addition, the following services are provided to travelers on official foreign travel: 1.  Worldwide current travel conditions in near or real-time. 2.  Ability to locate, track, and display via both graphical and report-based means the whereabouts of any individual in a travel status. 3.  Ability to interface with and capture itinerary data in near/real time from the Agency?s Travel Management System. 4.  Produce traveler-specific itinerary information and send to travelers via e-mail, phone, web, wireless device, or other device destination specific information concerning at least: Security, Transportation, Health, Entry/Exit Requirements, Financial, Language, Cultural, Environmental, and Legal. 5.  Ability to track employees via travel itinerary and the ability to communicate with located employees. 6.  Ability to display employees by name, date, destination, airline, flight number, hotel, and country security risk assessment level. 7.  Access to a centralized center 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 days a year with analysts available for questions and answers and additional information. 8.  Access to medical intelligence and foreign language specialists who can provide timely information and assistance at any moment. 9.  Feedback available in languages other than English as appropriate. 10.  Provide emergency assistance as needed for any situations requiring medical and/or security management (i.e., evaluation, medical evacuation, security escorts, etc) not already provided via other contracts or companies. NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from iJET Intelligent Risk Systems (iJET) on a sole source basis to provide these Global Intelligence/Travel Risk Management Services to the agency for the following reason: iJET is the current contractor providing these services to Johnson Space Center and Langley Research Center.  They are uniquely able to provide these services due to its existing worldwide intelligence infrastructure, data mining capabilities, and on-going working relationship with the agency?s Travel Management Contractor (TMC), CI Travel.  For the agency to purchase this highly specialized and unique service from another vendor at this time would result in the duplication of costs and time to bring another contractor up to date, as well as a cumbersome effort to synchronize what would be an incompatible tracking and information system with standard Agency procedures.  The primary reason for these additional costs would be the expense involved in field evaluation, computer programming, and other engineering to test the potential compatibility of a competitor?s product with the pre-existing iJET services, as computer connectivity, and programs already in use on and off-site.  iJET is the copyright-holder and sole developer, producer, manufacturer, and distributor of this travel intelligence information.   This effort does not extend the current period of performance of the existing purchase order.	It is anticipated that a NASA Agency-wide contract solution for Travel Risk Management Services may be procured in the future. The Government does intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on Wednesday, December 12, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Tongass National intends to conduct sole source negotiations with Alsek Air of Yakutat Alaska for aircraft transportation services.  The basis of the sole source negotiations is a belief that there is no one capable or interested in providing guaranteed availability, March thru August 2008, within 36 hours of notification for a minimum of 50 hours guaranteed flight time.  The intent of the resultant contract is to obtain services of aircraft fully operated by qualified personnel and equipped to meet the contract specifications for use in administration and protection of public lands. When given 36 hours notice during the Mandatory Availability Period, the aircraft must be available for the use of the Government.  The types of service which the aircraft will generally be required to perform include but are not restricted to transportation of personnel, equipment, and supplies; reconnaissance and observation; transportation of cargo; search and rescue missions; routine and tactical law enforcement missions and fire support.  Aircraft will be required to operate out of remote areas and must be of a design and power to adequately perform over and from such areas. Strict compliance with specifications on power, design of aircraft and use of Forest Service approved pilots shall be required.  The Forest Service has interagency and cooperative agreements with State and Federal Agencies and private landholders, and may dispatch aircraft under this contract for such cooperative use.  Firms which believe they can provide the services described above are invited to submit affirmative information via email to that effect to Stephen Patton (spatton@fs.fed.us) not later than 15 days following the publication of this notice.

<DESC>The objective of this notice is to notify available and interested vendors that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)seeks to expand the pool of expert program management contractors that provide Project Management Oversight (PMO) Program services for selected capital projects.  FTA defines oversight as a continuous review and evaluation of grantee and FTA processes to ensure compliance with statutory, administrative, and regulatory requirements. The Office of Engineering, through the Regional Offices, performs oversight of grantee project management that focuses on the management of major investments (New Starts, rail modernization, etc.) in transit projects. This activity begins early in project implementation, usually at the time of preliminary engineering. PMO contractors monitor the large caseload of projects, following guidelines established by FTA. They evaluate grantee project management and technical capacity and capability to successfully implement these major transit projects. They also monitor the projects to determine whether they are progressing on time, within budget, and in accordance with approved grantee plans and specifications. Other activities are also involved, such as design constructability, contract modification reviews, and value engineering submittals.

All sources that are able to provide said services, are encouraged to forward their capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) to the point of contact listed below by December 20, 2007.  All sources will be added to FTA's sources list and notified when the solicitation will be issued through a FEDBIZOPP?s notice.  Anticipated solicitation issuance date is late 1st quarter FY08.

The FTA will hold a Vendors Information Day, January 11, 2008 at the FTA Headquarters, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE (Metro Green Line), Washington, DC 20590, for the purpose of meeting and greeting new and seasoned vendors who are interested in this solicitation. The meeting will be held in the Oklahoma Room, West Building. There will be two sessions, 8:30 a.m. thru 12:00 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. thru 5:00 p.m. 

For security purposes, all interested vendors who plan to attend one or the other of these sessions must identify, by name and title, no more than two representatives per company to the Point of Contact, not later than January 4, 2008. The individuals must have Government issued pictured Identification to gain entrance into the building.

Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Intravenous Catheters. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usag e/forecasted requirement for this product is approximately $509,977. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site sup port and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vend or.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd. army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Failure to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technic al criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price quotes. <BR><BR>Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adeq uate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service P roduct Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR> <B R>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the  vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirem ents of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the  number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I: <BR>Vendors will respond to the FBO posting by e-mailing their interest in participating in the standardization process to the POC listed on t he FBO. The TRBO will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from the vendors. Vendors will provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria. The technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB clinicians will re view the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria. <BR><BR>Phase II: <BR>The TRBO office will request clinical evaluation sample s et and product literature from the vendors. The vendor will be required to send the no charge samples directly to the participating MTFs. Failure to meet the deadline for sample arrival will result in exclusion from the standardization process. Vendors wi ll be given 21 calendar days in which receipt of the samples at the MTF must occur. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by close of business, 4 p.m. local time, on the twenty first calendar day after the notice to ship. Failure to deliver samples by the requested deadline will result in disqualification from the standardization process.<BR><BR>The TPRB clinicians participating in the evaluation will form their team and evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in the clinical s etting. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type format with a 1-5 scoring format. The scale   descriptors are: One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical cri teria are weighted equally. <BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their products. Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result i n exclusion from the standardization process. The TPRBs support and TAMCs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of Peri Operative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry r epresentative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide traini ng materials to NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and 36th MDG Andersen. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructi onal methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide tr aining/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The clinical representatives, on the TPRB, from NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and 36th MDG Andersen, opted to exercise this option for the training and guidance of  the clinicians who will use the samples. This option is another method used to support the government's minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center: Each vendor will have a full work week, t o represent their product. Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing at TAMC on the first day of the work week. Day #1: The formal in-service program by the vendor for their devices will be presented. After this formal in-service episode, t he vendor serves as a clinical consultant to the clinicians. The remainder of that day and for the remaining work week, the vendor will be available, to serve as a consultant.Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for  consultations and guidance regarding the product. All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yok osuka and 36th MDG Andersen: Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation. The Pacific Region TPRB clinical representative, from each of these MTFs, will select the appropriate providers  for this evaluation. They will proctor and monitor the clinical evaluation process. Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teaching aides provided by a vendor. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephon e for questions, consultations and guidance.<BR><BR>Phase III:<BR>All vendors participating in the clinical evaluation will be asked to submit lowest price quote for analysis. Vendors will be given 7 calendar days from the date of request to submit their b est pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of this region. Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration. <BR><BR>The following elements will be considered in the pricing a nalysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (post-standardization costs), (2) Potential cost avoidance, (3) impact of unmatched lines, and (4) consideration of SKUs by each vendor. Due to the potential for base DAPA prices to be inflated, the impact of  RIA prices on the region is considered more important than other pricing elements.<BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the p roducts or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts  off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be neces sary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>The vendors will e-mail the price quote to the TRBO via e-mail  in the prescribed format. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors when combined are considered signif icantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR><BR>Technical/Company C riteria Evaluation<BR>Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the vendor s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified) 5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off  DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify t he vendor from further consideration).<BR><BR>1.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE NOTICE ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Alaska District Corps of Engineers intends to specify sole source products for Emergency Management Systems (EMS) manufactured by Federal Signal Fire Department for  various construction projects on Fort Richardson, Alaska.  The Directorate of Public Works for Fort Richardson requires various installation buildings to utilize an integrated EMS system. Due to the large number of Emergency Management System equipment av ailable on the open market, standards and limitations must be established for the use of these systems in order to maintain low initial costs and low maintenance costs.  All solicitations for new Military Construction (MILCON) on Fort Richardson will speci fy the use of Emergency Management Systems manufactured by Federal Signal Fire Department consisting of:<BR>  <BR>1)Fully integrated indoor and outdoor system.  The Federal Signal UltraVoice PAS system for Mass Notification allows for complete indoor and o utdoor alert and notification via a single system; 2)Common components (amplifiers, chargers, DC-DC converters, transceivers, and control boards) for indoor and outdoor electronic controllers; 3)Battery-operated giant voice and building MNS systems with ov er 90 minutes of voice capability or 30 minutes of full alert tones; 4)Highly efficient, Class-D, Pulse-width modulated amplifiers provide continuous duty PA and alert tone capability, along with being hot swappable; 5)NEMA4X, aluminum outdoor electronic c ontrollers and NEMA1 painted-steel indoor controllers.  Both designed for the specific application and environment; 6)Highly secure digital (FSK) communications protocol with security-key features to eliminate malicious activation; 7)Capability to supply m ultiple control points for status monitoring and activation of the system  each fully redundant to insure system readiness and availability; 8)Seven alert tones (customizable), 16 locally stored digital voice messages, live public address, and up to 99 me ssages (40 minutes) of digital messaging from each central control point; 9)Automatic alarm reporting for each building and outdoor (Giant Voice) siren for Loss of AC Power, Local Activation, Intrusion, and Low Battery; 10)Indoor speaker load supervision.  Advanced monitoring exceeds line supervision by measuring and reporting actual amplifier load, thus insuring that any significant indoor system loss is reported as a failure; 11)Ability to integrate, monitor, and control existing PA systems, strobes or ot her devices, and even detection devices such as radiation sensors or biological sensor devices; 12)Standard two-year parts and factory-performed bench labor, and the ability to offer an on-site warranty if desired; 13)Upgrade of the existing Federal Comman der Digital Software that is now controlling the existing Giant Voice System Systems at Fort Richardson and will be used to control all functions on the Indoor Mass Notification System. This permits the seamless utilization of your existing FWS control sys tem, for all indoor and outdoor warning system notifications Post wide.<BR><BR>The installation of any Emergency Management System components that are not in compliance with installation requirements requires either the removal and replacement of that devi ce or replacement of the entire installation Emergency Management System.   The use of Other than Full and Open Competition for these items is authorized by FAR 6.302-1 where a substantial duplication in cost to the Government is not expected to be recover ed through competition. <BR><BR>Interested manufacturers and suppliers may submit their marketing information and catalog with a description of how the product interfaces with Emergency Management Systems (EMS) manufactured by Federal Signal Fire Departmen t and how equipment can be interfaced and maintained with the existing equipment without duplication of costs to the government or how duplication of costs to t he government will be recovered through competition.  Mail information to the POC at US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, CEPOA-CT-CM(Coyner), PO Box 6898, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506-0898, or submit the information via email to susan.coyner@us.army.m il. <BR>

<SUBJECT>D -- KNOVA Software
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The NAICS Code is 541511.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Consona CRM, Inc., 450 E. 96th St., Suite 300, Indianapolis, IN 46240-3797, to acquire a 12-month renewal of software maintenance and support for CIT?s licensed KNOVA software products, with two (2) successive 12-month Option Periods, including an option to acquire licenses for other Knova software products during the 12-month Base Period as required to support the NIH Help Desk.  CIT previously selected KNOVA brand name software in 2004 for the initial design and installation to support the NIH Help Desk.  KNOVA has provided infrastructure maintenance support to the NIH Help Desk since that date.  KNOVA software is currently integrated into the NIH Help Desk?s Remedy problem-tracking system and is used directly by the NIH Help Desk staff and other NIH technical support infrastructure components.  In 2007, CIT acquired the upgrade, installation and deployment of KNOVA 7.2 to enable the NIH Help Desk to complete its transition to a service desk utilizing ITIL to assimilate the other components required to complete the service desk model.  In addition to enhanced functionality, the upgrade to KNOVA 7.2 provides CIT with a Return on Investment (ROI).  The acquisition of KNOVA 7.2 in 2007 was a major upgrade from the previous KNOVA Version 5.0 by providing the following enhancements:  Successful deployment of KNOVA 7.2 live in the NIH environment, including installation; KNOVA Contact Center for Internal Users; and Configuration of Authoring Workflow and Document, Template and External Content Integration.  KNOVA 7.2 is a top-rated product suite delivered on a powerful, adaptive NLP Search and Knowledge Management Platform.  KNOVA 7.2 provides an intuitive toolset that allows the NIH Help Desk to affect the customer experience in a far more granular manner.  KNOVA 7.2 features a patented self-learning search technology that enables users to access the best answers quickly.  Service desk agents simply enter questions or issues in the customer's own words (supporting the Federal Government?s Plain Language Initiative), and KNOVA Knowledge Desk informs them of the resolution options with the highest probability of success.  Critically, this patented self-learning search and Knowledge Management engine - called the Cognitive Processor? - continuously learns and improves with each transaction.  KNOVA 7.2 provides a more proactive approach to managing the customer help desk experience than the traditional focus on service resolution management.  The features included in KNOVA 7.2 also support collaboration across NIH Institutes/Centers.  Since KNOVA engineered the existing software used by the NIH Help Desk, no other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product could effectively map to the existing data.  Furthermore, the KNOVA 7.2 user interface supports Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. ? 794d).  CIT has determined that KNOVA 7.2 brand name software and support is the only COTS product that can provide the enhanced software functions required by the NIH Help Desk.  Consona is the only source for KNOVA software support with no authorized re-sellers.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software products and support specifications which will be considered by the agency.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the software requirements specified above.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.  Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within eleven (11) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.

<SUBJECT>76 -- Reuters America Online Service
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) Directorate of Intelligence (CCJ2) requires the purchase of Reuters World Service. This obtain independent, unbiased, detailed coverage of events in the USCENTCOM Area of Interest and Area of Responsibility in meeting analyst requirements for stories on key regional developments, assessments of issues, tip-offs, and detailed reporting. Other news services provide few if any reports on key regional developments or assessments in areas such as the Horn of Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian Republics. The widest access of Reuter?s news reporting to our intelligence analysts will enhance protection of our forces overseas as well as the continental United States. Specific stories that could lead to force protection and national defense in general are often not covered by other wire services. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Reuters America LLC, 311 S Wacker DR FL 11, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Reuters is the exclusive distributor of the Reuters World Service required by USCENTCOM.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V.  DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

Extensive access to Reuters World wire news service over the past seven years has proven successful in filling gaps in reporting from other news services. Reuter?s World Service is the only service that can meet the detailed level of reporting on a consistent and wide range basis required by USCENTCOM.

Reuters has 130 news bureaus world-wide with over 2500 journalists contributing. No other service provides this level of coverage. There are other news organizations that report on some of the same stories Reuters does. However the Reuter?s product has the following particular unique qualifications critical to this requirement:

	A: All Reuters? content is proprietary
	- Reuters generates all its own content and no other provider is licensed to redistribute their live newswires

	B:  There is no other similar known provider of news that is not aligned with a particular country, culture or movement and therefore, has no agenda or bias

-The Associated Press (AP) is a membership of US news organizations, all of whom contribute their own content
-The Agence France Presse (AFP) receives their funding from the French government
-United Press International (UPI) is owned by the Unification Church (Rev. Sun Myung Moon)

	C: There is no other provider of news that has the Breadth of Coverage of 			     

Reuters: -UPI and AFP don?t come close to the number of contributing reporters that Reuters has. Reuters has over 2500 contributing journalists while AFP has only 900 and UPI has 1200. This is important in reporting general international news the following examples highlight why:
	
	-- Invasion of Iraq 2003- AFP was not given the ability by US military to be imbedded with US troops. Reuters was imbedded and could report breaking news from inside the US military

-- Every US news organization had to leave Baghdad on the eve of the invasion Because as US news organizations they were too vulnerable to attack. Reuters Was able to stay

-- Israeli incursion into Gaza 2006. Because of Reuter?s independence they were able to report independently and were the only news organization able to report Images of Israeli troops operations

<SUBJECT>--Ceramic powder processing and formulation services.
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick, MA intends to award a Sole Source contract to Materials & Electrochemical Research Corp., d/b/a MER Corporation, 2960 S. Kolb Road, Tucson, Arizona 85706-9237, to conduct ceramic powder processing and formulation services.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract with an estimated value of approximately $125,000.00.  MER Corporation will use their proprietary technology to add carbon nanotubes to government furnished powder which wil l ultimately be used for a research and development effort involving body armor.  The rationale for other than full and open competition is that it has been determined based on MERs proprietary technology, they will be able to use their emerging suitable technologies to process and formulate advanced ceramic powders.  Technologies to be used for this action are proprietary since they were developed under a prior Army funded research and development effort under a Small Business Innovative Research Contract .  Therefore, since the technology to be used to perform this effort is proprietary and protected as SBIR Intellectual Property, MER Corporation is the only company capable of performing this service on behalf of the Army.  This notice of intent is not a r equest for competitive proposals.  However, all comments received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses  to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System Iden tifier for this procurement is 541712.  Questions concerning this synopsis can be directed to Valerie DeAngelis, Contract Specialist, at Valerie.DeAngelis@us.army.mil or by fax, (508)233-6024.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA):
Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) is posting this modification to generate new concept White Paper submittals for funding consideration within realigned program objectives and mission priorities of the Technology Coordination Office (TCO). The modification also updates current Government POC?s. The total amount of funding for new project starts in FY08 and FY 09 is expected to be in the vicinity of $20M. White Papers will be accepted at any time; however, funding decisions are generally made prior to May 1 for the next fiscal year which commences October 1. To simplify the changes, this modification will incorporate the original base BAA and all changes into this modification and will supersede the original Combined Solicitation.

BACKGROUND:
The mission of the Technical Coordination Office is to rapidly develop and field Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and technical collection capabilities consistent with current mission priorities. Within this framework, TCO is tasked to research, develop, and deploy new Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) collection technologies to provide persistent, undetected and difficult-to-counter surveillance of intelligence targets. TCO aims to be a premier provider of innovative MASINT and technical intelligence collection technologies as end-to-end systems able to respond to both tactical and strategic needs of the intelligence and war-fighter communities.

AREAS OF INTEREST:
In order for organizations to gain a clearer picture of TCO?s mission requirement priorities and the technologies proposed to meet these requirements it will be necessary to request mailing of classified information. Participants can request a registered mailing at the SECRET level from Ms. Susan Engel. Her unclassified email address is susan.engel@patrick.af.mil. Requestors must have a SECRET facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding that can be verified by the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:
The Virginia Contracting Activity is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches within the general MASINT scientific disciplines. TCO is seeking White Papers that offer demonstration of first or next generation prototypes that can generally be developed within 12-24 months. New systems and approaches as well as novel exploitation of existing intelligence or non-intelligence systems and data with potential to satisfy gaps in intelligence collection capabilities are of high interest. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that detects, locates and identifies unique and operationally exploitable signatures of fixed and dynamic sources of interest. Development of this technology into operationally useful systems requires a wide range of scientific, engineering and technical expertise combined with knowledge of current intelligence and military requirements, capabilities, and operations. Scientific disciplines considered components of MASINT include electro-optics, radar and radio frequency, trace materials sampling, nuclear radiation, geophysics. These disciplines are augmented with expertise for systems engineering/integration with manned and unmanned air/land/water/space based platforms, command, control and communications systems and processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) systems. For a developmental system to be successfully transitioned to real-world intelligence collection operations, it must be compatible with existing operational concepts/doctrine, processes, systems, logistical, environmental realities and force protection constraints.

SCHEDULE:
This MASINT Transitional BAA is open and effective for a period of four years from the date of release (1 Nov 04 - 1 Oct 08), and is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories. White Papers will be accepted at any time. This BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 hours local time on the closing date, 1 October 2008. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

WHITE PAPERS:
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The White Paper should include the White Paper Cover Sheet (attachment 1), containing the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any. It is a best estimate of the anticipated cost of the effort. The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed. The White Paper does not include a cost proposal. It must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration and the technical objectives. It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort. The White Paper must also include past performance data (attachment to 2-4 page white paper), in accordance with the attached instructions (attachment 2). White papers should avoid proprietary or classified information or data not critical to the idea being presented. Note: White Papers already submitted under BAA-04-01-JT 1 or BAA-05-01-JT2, should not be resubmitted under this BAA modification.
 
FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL:
The format for white papers follows below. White paper proposals that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Date, Title, Company name, Period of performance, estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task objective and relevant mission areas(s) being addressed; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration. Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors. All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch. Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with the approved MASINT security guide. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award. All white paper responses to this announcement must be addressed to: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway AlA, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002. E-mailed white paper submissions are not accepted. E-mailed questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors, during the white paper proposal development phase of this acquisition, should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer and must reference the title and BAA-05-01-JT2 number. White Paper Transmittal Addresses: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway AlA, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925. White papers classified above the level of Secret must be directed to the Chief, Security Division, David Sorter, 1030 South Highway AlA, Building 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, phone: 321-494-6701

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
The evaluation of white papers and proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Mission Capability-within classified mission areas; Scientific/Technical Merit, Operational Feasibility, Operational Readiness and Qualifications & Capabilities. The Mission area managers will evaluate the offeror?s proposal for improved ability to satisfy specific mission area requirements, the ability to operationally field the technology, the offeror?s knowledge, skills and technical expertise in the field of MASINT R&D, and the offeror?s ability to rapidly respond to operational needs. (2) Relevant Past & Present performance, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government/commercial contracts, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal that shall be considered.

PROPOSALS:
White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the invitation to submit a proposal.

AWARDS:
Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program priorities to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in Nov 04. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $3 million per year. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA, from Nov 04 - Sep 09, is over $100 million. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TOP SECRET-SCI clearance or the means to support a special access security environment, facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to U.S. SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. These offerors should immediately contact the contracting officer for information if they contemplate responding. Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.

NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL:
All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. The program office has contracted for various non-government scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. All non-government contractor support personal (currently from ZelTech, MTC, and EWA) has signed and are bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. Non-government staff support personnel will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as Government Access Only. Proposals labeled by the offerors as for ?Administrative Purposes Only? will only be handled by non-government staff support contractors in an administrative role. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. All evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators. Non-government staff support contractors may serve as technical advisors in the evaluation of proposals. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.

The procurement will be conducted under other than full and open competition, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  A redacted version of the brand name justification follows.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Agency.

        Department of Health and Human Services
        Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
	Office of Acquisition and Grants Management
	            
2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
	
This justification seeks authority to negotiate two (2) non-competitive commercial items contracts for software license maintenance and support with Sterling Commerce for Connect:Direct (C:D), and Gentran Integration Suite (GIS), which are installed at CMS and the intermediary/carrier Medicare sites.  The applicable licenses will continue to allow CMS to support electronic file transfers.  The term for both contracts will be a one year base period, with four (4) one year optional periods.  The base period of performance for the C:D for OS390 (Mainframe) contract shall be from December 20, 2007 through December 19, 2008, with the optional periods running through December 19, 2012.  The base period for the C:D for Mid Tier UNIX and GIS contract shall be from January 20, 2008 through January 19, 2009, with the optional periods running through January 19, 2013.

3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Agency?s needs (including the estimated value).

These required contracts for software license maintenance support of the C:D for OS390 and Mid-tier UNIX, and GIS products will include licensing rights, maintenance, technical support, software defect fixes, new releases of software and upgrade protection during the period of performance.  

The estimated price for the two contracts is as follows:
?	C:D for OS 390, including the optional periods, is approximately $[redacted]. 
?	C:D for Mid Tier UNIX, and GIS, including the optional periods, is approximately $[redacted].
                   
4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

This justification is based upon the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency?s requirements. 

 
5. 	A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

C:D software is the industry standard for file transfer.  This product has been installed and is currently being used at CMS, state and other federal agencies, and all Medicare and Medicaid sites since 1987.  C:D is used to move data to support all CMS Medicare and Medicaid major business lines, including the following:

[Redacted]

This propriety software is critical to the success of CMS in administering the Medicare program, and the MMA.  The use of C:D is critical since it is already widely used, understood and deeply embedded in Medicare file exchanges.  In addition, Sterling?s GIS product, is seamlessly integrated into the current C:D based file transfer architecture at CMS.  Since C:D and GIS are proprietary products of Sterling, there are no other sources that meet the Government?s needs.  At the present time it is not possible to introduce a new contractor with an untested and potentially unreliable file transfer product. Any delay in awarding this order to Sterling will result in disruption to the processing of Medicare claims and potentially cause considerable harm to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries.  Sterling is the only responsible source that can provide the software maintenance, and upgrades necessary to fulfill the requirement to transmit Medicare data between CMS and the intermediary/carrier processing centers, within the timeframes the Agency requires.

6.         A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical.

A synopsis, in accordance with the exception for the acquisition of commercial items authorized under FAR 5.203(a)(1) and FAR 5.203(b), will be published after the approval of this JOFOC.  Since this procurement is for brand name, proprietary products of Sterling Commerce, and Sterling does not have any authorized resellers of their products, CMS has determined that there are no other potential sources that can meet our requirements.       
 
7.	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

[Redacted]

8.	Description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons why a market survey was not conducted.

In 2007, CMS evaluated several products as possible replacements for C:D.  Two were identified as technically meeting minimum requirements for CMS file transfer.  [Redacted]  While these products were technically capable of performing the file transfer minimum functions, the effort to convert an estimated thirty thousand file transfer jobs at CMS and the Medicare Processing Centers was deemed too technically difficult to implement and cost prohibitive to undertake.  In past discussions with the Gartner Group, it was determined that the best approach for business entities the size of CMS and the Medicare Contractor Data Centers is to continue using C:D and negotiate the best financial arrangement with Sterling.  This has become the Office of Information Services (OIS) posture for file transfer.  With the purchase of Sterling?s GIS, which tightly couples with the C:D product to exchange files with CMS business partners over the Internet, C:D became more deeply embedded in core CMS business functions and very difficult to replace.  CMS will continue to monitor technical literature and trade journals for future trends in comparable file transfer products.

9.	Other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition:

Additional factors supporting this JOFOC are:
?	There are imbedded software references in programming that crosses all Tier levels. The impact of having to re-program this software would be extremely time and resource consuming.
?	The cost to replace the existing File Transfer software is estimated to be over $[Redacted]. 
?	There would be an additional cost to the Consolidated Information Technology Infrastructure Contract (CITIC) staff to facilitate any conversion from one file transfer software vendor to another that is not directly provided for in the CITIC support contract.
?	Finally, there is the impact on the transporting of data.  CMS has a tremendous responsibility to provide the most proven file transfer software available, that cannot be jeopardized by incorporating an unproven file transfer product.

10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:

A synopsis, in accordance with the exception for the acquisition of commercial items authorized under FAR 5.203(a)(1) and FAR 5.203(b), will be published after the approval of this JOFOC.   Any responses received will be properly evaluated. 

11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any substantial acquisition for the supplies or services required:

As with all hardware and software architecture, OIS will continue its evaluation of the file transfer software products referred to in Item 8 for functionality, systems value, and overall benefit to the Agency and its directives.  Although the migration to other file transfer software and the associated conversion of workloads at CMS and the Medicare Processing Centers was deemed to be cost-prohibitive at this time, OIS will continue to monitor trade journals and analyze comparable file transfer products for a potential replacement in the future.

A.12  Disaster Recovery Clause.  Government hereby certifies to Contractor that it has a bona fide disaster plan with respect to the computer software programs used in its operations.  The Contract/Order authorizes the Government's operation to maintain a second copy of software on tape for use at loading at sites that are not live (e.g. subscription-based disaster recovery services) for the sole purpose of duplicating or mirroring the software environment of the "primary" licenses at the designated licensed site and as described herein.  Additionally, use of the software at the contingency sites must not include general access or any processing for program development or production.  Contractor shall permit operation and testing of all licensed programs at the contingency sites as designated by the Government without prior approval and at no additional cost to the Government solely for the purpose of maintaining or implementing disaster recovery readiness including continuity of business operations.  CPUs, MIPS or MSUs at these contingency sites are excluded from the total CPUs, MIPS or MSUs count included elsewhere in the Contract/Order and are not separately billable.  Activation of operations at a contingency site shall be at Government's discretion.  Government is authorized to install all software at the contingency sites for testing, problem resolution purposes, and to ensure there will be no operational delays in association with transition of workload from the designated licensed site to the contingency sites.  Use of the software at the contingency sites in the event of a disaster shall continue until such time as normal processing can be resumed at the "primary" site regardless of the duration required.  Nothing in the Contract/Order diminishes the Government's rights in accordance with the data rights clause(s).  Any license keys, codes, or passwords required by the Contractor in order to use the software at the contingency sites shall be provided to the Government within 10 days of the Governments request. A.13  Disabling Software Code.  The Government requires delivery of computer software that does not contain any code that will, upon the occurrence or the nonoccurrence of any event, disable the software.  Such code includes but is not limited to a computer virus, restrictive key, node lock, time-out or other function, whether implemented by electronic, mechanical, or other means, which limits or hinders the use or access to any computer software based on residency on a specific hardware configuration, frequency of duration of use, or other limiting criteria.  If any such code is present, the Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages suffered as a result of a disabling caused by such code, and the Contractor agrees to remove such code upon the Governments request at no extra cost to the Government.  Inability of the Contractor to remove the disabling software code will be considered an inexcusable delay and a material breach of contract, and the Government may exercise its right to terminate for cause.  In addition, the Government is permitted to remove the code as it deems appropriate and charge the Contractor for consideration for the time and effort in removing the code. A.13  NOTICE OF THE FEDERAL ACCESSIBILITY LAW AFFECTING ALL ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENTS (SECTION 508) On August 7, 1998, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended to require that when Federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology, that they shall ensure it allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees.

<DESC>Amendment 4 - questions previously omitted

Additional Questions:

1)	The current data files coming into FCA are in widely varying formats.  
?	Does the FCA have the statutory authority to dictate a common data format to its data supplying agencies?  Yes, but we do not plan to dictate a common data format for this project.  See also the answer to technical question 25.
2)	Will the contractor be providing the data supplying agencies guidance and/or programming assistance in converting their existing data feeds from current methods to the new XML method?  No.  See also the answer to technical question 29.
3)	Does FCA anticipate utilizing a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Extract-Transform-and-Load (ETL) tool such as Informatica or Oracle Warehouse Builder to perform the XML data receipt and database loading, or is a custom coded solution anticipated?
?	Is there such a tool already purchased within FCA and/or is there budget to procure such COTS tools?  No.  See also the answers to technical questions 9 and 46.
4)	The ?Data Collection and Storage? section states that a ?relational database design? is required, yet in other places the system is referred to as a ?data warehouse.?  [The typical database design for data warehouse reporting solutions is vastly different from a relational/transactional design.]
?	Which type of database design solution is anticipated here: a relational/transactional or a dimensional/reporting type database design?  See answer to technical question 25.  The current design is a relational database.  FCA wants the contractor to determine the best future database design.
5)	Reference is made to the need to remove Social Security Numbers and other sensitive data from the incoming feeds.  Will an independent Certification & Accreditation (C&A) process be required before the system can be opened to the internet?  Will the contractor be required to conduct and/or support this C&A process? What are the security requirements associated with deploying this system?  FCA is responsible for the security requirements of this system.
?	Will the contractor be responsible for conducting NIST or DoD level database security implementations to ensure the safety of data being handled within the system?  No.
6)	What does ?cost reimbursement? mean in terms of contract types?  Cost reimbursement in the RFQ means that, for task 6, an hourly rate will be used for services not to exceed a certain dollar amount identified in each task order.
7)	What is the level of Background check that will be required of contractors of FCA?  
a)	Will the simple submission of an SF-85p be sufficient, or will additional background checks such as credit checks, NCIC checks and full background investigations led by Security investigators be required?  
b)	Will these background checks be mandatory to be completed and accepted before work can commence on the project 
[problematic with the government?s current massive backlog of background investigations].  
c)	Can interim clearances be obtained while any full investigations are underway?
See answer to Contract/Proposal Question 3. NACIs will be required of contractors.  SF-85s are sufficient.  Interim clearances can be obtained


The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) has an immediate need for services from a qualified person(s) who is knowledgeable of and experienced in relational database management design and development, as well as data loading and mining operations.  The Contractor will assist FCA in developing a database to accumulate and store the loan portfolio data submitted by FArm Credit System institutions to the FCA.  The database will enhance the data interrogation capabilities of the FCA's examination and regulation and policy development staff by consolidating System data into a single database with comparable data fields.  The data tables will facilitate macro analysis of oversight of the System.  


Interested parties should contact Reevest@fca.gov for a complete Statement of Work.  

Questions will be received through November 30, 2007, at 2:00 PM EST.  An amendment will be posted answering questions December 4, 2007.

Proposals should be sent to Reevest@FCA.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST, Wednesday, December 12, 2007.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

The FCA is a nonappropriated fund activity not subject to GAO's bid protest provisions.  Any claim for relief filed by an offeror shall be adjudicated by the FCA Contracting Officer.  If the parties cannot reach an agreement mutually satisfactory after diligently pursuing a solution through discussions and negotiations, the FCA Contracting Officer shall make a final decision.  The FCA Contracting Officer's decision shall prevail unless the offeror submits an appeal to the FCA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Stephen G. Smith.  The decision of the CFO shall be final and binding on the parties.

<DESC>RFQ:  DJMS-08-Q-0006
Questions and Answers


1.The number of hours is listed as 2,008. Is this a    typographical error that should have read 2,080 hours which is the standard number of work hours in a year?

The estimated number of hours should read 2,008. This is 2088 hours minus 80 hours (10 holidays at 8 hours per day). 

2.  Does the number of hours (2,008 or 2,080) reflect the estimate of hours for one resource or is this total to be split among the two resources? I.e. two full-time resources or two part-time resources?

2008 hours are allotted for each resource.

3.  Since there is only one resource working with one USMS employee, how are we expected to accommodate the USMS employee when our resource is away from work due to vacation or sick leave?

I am unable to tell you how to compute your rates or staff your positions. However, the contract requires that a resource be provided for each physically challenged USMS employee Monday through Friday. 

4.  Bidders list 

A bidders list is not a requirement for this procurement vehicle.

5.  Person (incumbent) or entity currently performing the contract/project.
 
The five year Personal Assistant services contract was preformed by ENDdependence Central of Northern VA

6.  Main differences between old statement of work and the current one or the old contract number, title, award date of when this project was last performed/managed.

The last 5 year contract number was MS-02-C-0020 for Personal Assistant Services, awarded Sept. 2, 2002.   


7.  Old contract amount and/or price

Five year contract award amount $628,800 

8. Other question and answers from other contractors/persons. 

Other questions of interested parties are addressed herein.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices.

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

**CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS**

1) Is the tower base (at an erection location) to be of mass concrete or otherwise as we can also supply a wide steel base as an alternative which makes for ease of relocation

ANSWER:  A WIDE STEEL BASE WOULD BE PREFFERED FOR RELOCATION PURPOSES.  HOWEVER, THE BASE MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN UP TO 70 MPH WINDS AS OUR RANGE HAS PERIODS OF EXTREME WINDS.

2) Why do you want embossed aluminum sheet on the inside and the outside of the booth walls and on the floor? We normally use steel sheet for the walls and steel checker plate for the floor.  

ANSWER:  STEEL OR ALUMINUM WILL BE ACCEPTABLE.

3) Can we offer an alternative for the booth and tower sizes so that they can fit into a standard ISO shipping container? This makes for a very significant difference in the shipping costs. 
  
ANSWER:  IF THE BOOTH SIZES ARE RELATIVELY THE SAME SIZE AND THE TOWER IS STILL AROUND 20' THERE SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.

4) There is no reference to insulation of the roof or the walls of the booth and we want to clarify this.  

ANSWER: INSULATION WILL BE ACCEPTED BUT PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS IS A LOWEST PRICED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE PROJECT

5) Is this a Single Phase 100 Amp load center with 12 circuit breaker spaces and a main breaker?  

ANSWER:  THIS CONFIGURATION IS ACCEPTABLE.

- Is the electricity supply for the HVAC unit to be 230 Volt single phase 60 CPS? 

ANSWER: YES 

- The grating deck mentioned is to be alongside the door only or all the way around the booth?  

ANSWER: GRATING DECK SHOULD BE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BOOTH IF THIS DOES NOT OVERLY INCREASE COSTS.

Please e-mail your quotes to sean.blair@nellis.af.mil. Please contact Lt Sean Blair with any questions/concerns at 702-652-9575. Quotes are due on or before 4:30pm 7 Dec 07, Pacific Standard Time.
