<a href="mailto:mable.youngblood@us.army.mil">AMCOM Contracting Center - Air (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>This requirement is for a new Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contract for the purchase of Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) to include operations and maintenance training of Flight Training Devices (FTDs).. There is an urgent requirement to establish an indigenous combat flying capability, with a requisite Pilot Training Program. The proposed contractor for this effort is MD Helicopters Inc. (MDHI), 2702 North Ogden Road, Mesa, Arizona 85215, Cage Code 1KVX4, a woman owned small business. MDHI is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only qualified source of support of this effort. Although other helicopter CLS providers exist, only MDHI has access to the critical spares, consumables, technical data, special tools, and test equipment and could provide them within the timeline required to meet the training start date. The required start date for the training capability is October 2011. The first required Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) training start date is two months later, December 2011. In order to meet those timelines, the CLS provider must begin site activation no later than July 2011. During this period the contractor must ensure appropriate spares, consumables and support equipment are in place, activate office(s), shop(s), and storage space, and install necessary office equipment, communications and other requirements needed to perform CLS immediately upon arrival of the first aircraft and FTD. As the OEM, only MDHI maintains the technical data necessary for the cognizant engineering airworthiness authority to determine which potential modifications would or would not measurably affect the airworthiness of an aircraft system. Additionally, MDHI is the only company with the engineering data required to provide a comprehensive Configuration Management program. This program addresses, obsolescence mitigation/management, configuration control and configuration change processing. The MD 530F is solely produced by MDHI, and it is the only firm that has the knowledge, expertise, and technical data required to support and sustain this system in the unique conditions and environment in which the aircraft are expected to operate. The MD-530F FTD initial support package (spares) required to support the simulator, is not due from the OEM until 180 days after contract award (~September 2011). Currently, there are no spares, repair parts, pricing, special tools and test equipment adequately identified and available to support fielding of the FTDs outside of the OEM. MDHI is the only company that has the long lead-time parts on-hand in sufficient quantities required to successfully execute the CLS requirement. Only the OEM could ensure that the appropriate spares, consumables and support equipment are in place in time to perform CLS immediately upon arrival of the first FTD.

No partial bidding will be allowed.<br /><br />The IFB package will be NATO UNCLASSIFIED.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The new Crisis Establishment (CE) version of 16.0 for HQ ISAF, Kabul was approved in August 2010 and took effect on October 1, 2010. The manpower increase provides additional personnel within HQ ISAF, resulting in an increase of the requirement for end user equipment.
<p>In response to the above situation, CJ6/HQ ISAF identified an urgent requirement (CUR OPS 1058) for providing additional CIS equipment based on the difference between CE version 15.1 and CE version 16.0.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>This project is to deliver hardware (115 workstations, 17 printers, 28 VoIP phones, 28 NCN phones, 23 additional monitors, 3 switches, cables) including 1 year of warranty, and software to the HQ ISAF in Kabul, Afghanistan. The installation and the configuration inside the HQ is an NCSA/CST (NATO Communications Services Agency/CIS Support Team) responsibility, and will therefore not be part of the prospective contract.</p>
<p>The requested equipment must be completely interoperable with the existing CIS infrastructure/architecture in place, a description of which will be provided with the IFB, and compliant with the current NATO CIS/security standards in use in the Area of Operations.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE<br /><br />Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.<br /><br />U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br /><br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm<br /><br />The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:<br /><br />- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents<br /><br />After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.

<DESC>Title: National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation Continuing Training and Materials Maintenance Project
<p>&nbsp;Background and Need</p>
<p>CDC currently funds approximately 240 community based organizations (CBOs) and health departments (HDs) to provide HIV prevention programs. The Program Evaluation Branch (PEB) within the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) has promoted the use of the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) variables for standardized data collection and reporting for national and local HIV prevention monitoring and evaluation. PEB has also provided an optional web-base software, the HIV Prevention Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS), to assist grantees. The collection and analysis of standardized HIV prevention evaluation data allows CDC to report on HIV prevention efforts at the national level. Funded agencies are required to report the NHM&amp;E required data and either use PEMS or other CDC-provided software for data submission to CDC or submit data compliant with NHM&amp;E requirements and formats to satisfy the terms of their cooperative agreements. PEB also promotes the use of data for monitoring and evaluation at the local level. The PEMS software provides functionality for grantees to track their program efforts and review their own data for program monitoring and improvement.</p>
<p>Three large-scale software training sessions consisting of 18 meetings, each a week long, to train about 15 people each week, were conducted after each of the first major releases of the PEMS software. One representative from participating health departments and community-based organizations received the software training and related materials in order to train their staff members. Each of the training sessions focused specifically on technical skills required to implement PEMS. In addition to software training activities, CDC conducted training on HIV prevention program data collection strategies and required variables.</p>
<p>A lesson learned from these experiences was that grantees need continuing, integrated training. The training should:<br />&#61607; focus on collecting and using the NHM&amp;E data,<br />&#61607; emphasize how required data can be used for program evaluation and monitoring activities, <br />&#61607; focus on activities necessary for using PEMS or other data collection software, <br />&#61607; assist grantees to improve program planning, management, and delivery of services.</p>
<p>Due to high turn-over rates among these organizations and agencies, many participating HDs and CBOs may currently have no staff trained in NHM&amp;E or to use PEMS software, contributing to great variation in the level of implementation of evaluation and use of the PEMS. Staff may also not have an understanding of CDC's data requirements and how data can be used for improving HIV prevention programs. Hence, CDC is currently in the process of developing NHM&amp;E training materials and presentations to cover a wide variety of needs. The goal is to develop web-based training materials that can be used by grantee staff on an as-needed, on-demand basis as self-paced learning, materials that can be used in webinars and other electronic training media, materials that can be used electronically or printed by grantees for their own use in conducting training for their own employees or contractors or as reference, and to develop and deliver training in a variety of settings (e.g., in-person, electronically, etc.). The task order to develop the initial set of materials and deliver these trainings ended December 31, 2009. A follow-on task order will end February 25, 2011. A four-month task order to keep work going through June 30, 2011 is in process. The proposed contract includes the development and completion of remaining training modules.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the NHM&amp;E requirements are evolving as the epidemic and program monitoring needs change, and since the PEMS software will also be modified or replaced to accommodate grantee requests, changes in requirements, and improvements in system function, there is also a need to continue developing the NHM&amp;E training and to maintain and improve the components of the training. This is the basis for this NHM&amp;E Continuing Training Development and Maintenance Project contract request.</p>

<CONTACT>Julie L. Brooke, Contract Specialist, Phone 7035883620, Email julie.brooke@hq.dodea.edu
<DESC><p>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) intends to issue a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 to LibraryWorld, Inc., 100 W San Fernando St. STE 535, San Jose, CA 95113-2327 in the estimated amount of $70,000 (Estimated Nine (9) Month Base Period plus Three (3) Three Month Option Periods) under NAICS Code 511210. DoDEA currently owns and operates the LibraryWorld library automation system. <br /><br />DoDEA will replace this system and its associated software with a new worldwide integrated library automation system that will provide systemwide distribution of resources. DoDEA competed this new requirement and awarded a contract effective 27 September 2010. However, it is anticipated that full implementation of the new system will not be complete until 31 December 2012.<br /><br />Because the current LibraryWorld library automation system contract expires 30 September 2011 and full implementation of the newly competed system is not expected until 31 December 2012, there is a time period for which there is no technical support. This technical support is imperative to the operation of the libraries at DoDEA schools worldwide. The proposed acquisition is to continue the technical support during this time period. The base period of performance represents the minimum time required to maintain the critical operation of the libraries until the full implementation of the competitively awarded contract is complete. <br /><br />DoDEA must continue to use LibraryWorld for the required technical support, because it is the only contractor capable of providing this requirement. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 LibraryWorld is the only responsible source and no other source will satisfy DoDEA's requirement. LibraryWorld is the only source that can support the existing technical support which DoDEA requires for the current system.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please send your documentation to Julie Brooke by e-mail to <a href="mailto:julie.brooke@hq.dodea.edu">julie.brooke@hq.dodea.edu</a>. Documentation should be received within 5 calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by DoDEA. A determination by DoDEA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Finance Office of Enterprise Solutions Group (OES), is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing a broad range of services to include Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, Resource Planning and Analysis, Financial Analysis, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), Acquisition Planning, Implementation and Transition, Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, Strategic Planning and Policy Development. The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  In order to determine which vendors have the required capabilities and expertise for the SOW requirements, the FAA requires interested Vendors to explain and describe their capabilities and recent past experience in performing in ALL functional areas listed in the attached OES Synopsis in their response.  The response should pertain only to contracts of a similar size and complexity as that represented per the draft statement of work provided with this announcement.  For purposes of this assessment, be advised that the estimated value of this procurement is $41M for a period of 5 years.
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that:	This is not a SIR or Request for Proposals;	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;	The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and	Any costs associated with the market survey response submittals are solely at the interested party's expense.
Details of this announcement are listed below:
1.  PurposeThe purpose of this Market Survey is to: (1)	Ascertain industry capability and capacity levels for both small and large businesses relative to the functional areas cited, and to improve the Government understanding of the current marketplace to identify qualified and capable sources to perform the services described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  (2)	Survey the marketplace to assess the level of interest among qualified service providers (small or large businesses) of the required services.
2.  Description of the Required ServicesThe FAA ATO Finance Services Office of Enterprise Solutions Group's primary objective is to select and implement resource management efficiencies via performance-based business solutions and targeted acquisitions.  This is accomplished through studies and analyses of resources, systems, policies, procedures, technical operations, and organizational structure.  This, in turn, leads to more comprehensive acquisition planning, resource planning, and business process re-engineering.
The contractor will provide a broad range of support services relating to Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, Resource Planning and Analysis, Financial Analysis, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), Acquisition Planning, Implementation and Transition, Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, Strategic Planning and Policy Development. The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  
3.  NAICS CodeThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 Million. 
4.  Responses to the Market SurveyInterested parties should submit the following information in response to this Market Survey by May 16, 2011.(a)	A one-page letter of transmittal. (b)	A statement of capabilities and past experience not to exceed eight pages (12 point Times New Roman font or similar with 1 inch margins or greater) that address your company's capabilities and past experience for each of the following eight functional areas:  -  Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, -  Resource Planning and Analysis, -  Financial Analysis, -  Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), -  Acquisition Planning, -  Implementation and Transition, -  Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, -  Strategic Planning and Policy Development 
Your response should address each of the eight functional areas in the same order as shown above and should address both your capabilities and capacity.  Capacity should be addressed in terms of the size of your company (FTEs and revenue) as well as in the specific past experiences (previous contracts) described in the response for each functional area.  For any of the eight functional areas where your company has no capability, capacity and/or past experience the response should clearly identify this lack of capability, capacity and/or past experience.  


The response should also address:  
	A list of contracts under which your company has provided these types of services in the past 5 years including the name of the contract, client, your company's staffing level on the contract (# of FTEs), contract total price or value, your company's percentage of the total staffing on the contract, and your company's role on the contract (prime or subcontractor). 	Number of years your company has been in business.	Geographical areas where your company can provide the noted services without charging the government any long distance travel costs.   The government plans for all work to be accomplished in the Washington DC Metropolitan area and does not intend to pay long-distance travel expenses. (c) A completed and signed Business Declaration Form attached to this Market Survey.
For purposes of this market research effort, should a response be vague or unclear with respect to capability, capacity and/or past experience in any of the eight areas, the government will conclude that the responder lacks capability and/or capacity in that specific area to perform these services at the noted anticipated size and level of complexity (as depicted per the draft SOW and estimated value).

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the U.S. Forest Service <strong>contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-024B-S-11-0011 on or about April 22, 2011 via Fed Biz Opps (FBO)</strong> for a large fire cost review contract.
<p>Projected contract: The U.S. Forest Service intends to award a requirements contract with a <strong>base and four (4) option years</strong>.</p>
<p>Project Description: The contractor will be responsible for hiring a diverse team with expertise in the areas of wildland fire management, land management, risk management, and wildfire suppression strategies. The contractor will recruit skilled personnel from other land management and response agencies, and possibly other countries, to review the agency's response to wildfires. This might include specialists from the military, academia, industry, and emergency agencies for expertise in land management, wildland fire management, risk management, and large field operations involving ground and air assets and catastrophic threats to the public. The contractor will hire, coordinate and oversee the work of the Independent Panel. The panel is tasked with examining and reporting on fire suppression costs for wildfire incidents during Fiscal Year 2010 where federal expenditures exceeded $10,000,000. The panel's purpose will be to determine if the agency exercised fiscal diligence in managing specific incident suppression activities. This panel is not expected to complete an exhaustive fiscal audit of all incident phases. Rather, the focus will be on evaluating how these large fires were managed. The Review objectives for this year's panel should focus, as possible, on the following areas: &bull;Evaluating the risk-based management of these large fires from a systems standpoint - from planning and decision-making through implementation and the outcomes that resulted. For each of these stages, people, skills, and technology should be assessed and what in the system worked well and what in the system needs to be improved should be identified. &bull;Assessing the utilization of new processes, guidance, expectations and tools that have changed the business of fire management in recent years in an effort to determine the impact these changes have had and develop a baseline for comparison in future years as these efforts mature. &bull;Determining whether the agency's current review process is yielding positive changes and identifying ways to improve the agency's current fire review processes. If the panel finds instances where the agency may not have executed prudent fiscal decisions with respect to public/firefighter safety, natural resource, and private property protection, estimate the proportions of appropriate and excess suppression costs (recognizing that "excess costs' would be earmarked for return to the treasury based on end of fiscal year 2010 balances). Summarize findings in a report to the Secretary of Agriculture. <br /><br />Participation: This project is <strong>100% set-aside for small business concerns</strong>. <br /><br />The NAICS code for this acquisition is <strong>541690</strong>. <br /><br />The small business size standard is <strong>$7.0 million</strong> average income over the last three years.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Asylum Research of Goleta, CA, for the acquisition of a ARC2 Controller System, to be used by the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) supports the U.S. nanotechnology enterprise from discovery to production by providing industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies with access to world-class nanoscale measurement and fabrication methods and technology. The CNST is the only national nanocenter with a focus on commerce.</p>
<p>The CNST's shared-use NanoFab gives researchers economical access to and training on a state-of-the-art tool set required for cutting-edge nanotechnology development. Looking beyond the current state of the art, CNST research is creating the next generation of nanoscale measurement instruments and methods, which are made available through collaboration.</p>
<p>NIST's CNST Division currently owns an existing Asylum Research ARC2 Controller. The existing ARC2 Controller and the purchase of a new Asylum Research ARC2 Controller is required to be compatible with a custom designed Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The AFM is a NIST custom designed and developed AFM. The AFM requires the use of the Asylum Research ARC2 Controller to supply signals to the AFM and to record and analyze signals from the AFM. Data obtained from the instruments must be compatible with each other. The AFM requires that the data be recorded by the same procedure of the existing ARC2 Controller, which is defined by the proprietary hardware and software protocols of the ARC2 Controller. Due to the proprietary nature of the system, no other vendor is capable of providing the required controller for the AFM. Asylum Research does not license other vendors to utilize their proprietary technology. Asylum Research is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the instrument that is required to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by Wednesday May 11, 2011 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<p><br />NCI designed and conducted The Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) population-based study, between April 2002 and February 2005, precisely to study the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer risk and progression with the aim of improving preventive and treatment strategies for lung cancer. Since approximately 5 years have passed since the study was initiated, NCI needs to collect information on disease progression from every lung cancer case enrolled in EAGLE. Specific details on treatment, toxicity after treatment as well as disease progression, and survival are needed to identify the genetic determinants and other factors that could impact survival and treatment efficacy. Moreover, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer has recently issued a Revised International System for Staging Lung Cancer, based on information from a clinical database of more than 5,000 patients.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this contract is to (1) support the collection of data on treatment, toxicity, disease progression and survival for all lung cancer cases enrolled in EAGLE and (2) the restaging of all lung cancer diagnoses based on the new 2010 AJCC classification.</p>
<p><br />The University of Milan, Italy EPOCA Center for Epidemiology Research with Dr. Angela Pesatori is uniquely qualified to conduct these activities. The EAGLE study coordination and management including enrollment of all study subjects, epidemiological data, clinical data and biospecimen collection was done at the University of Milan; they also developed the database construction for all EAGLE data.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Boeing Aircraft Company for modifications to four (4) V-22 Hydraulic Automated Test Systems (VHATS). The modifications will include hardware, installation services, associated technical data, and updates to the existing VHATs software. Aircraft modifications have necessitated previously unforseen and unknown modifications to the VHATS hardware and software to fully test all V-22 aircraft actuators. The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not possess the drawings or technical data for the VHATS to permit full and open competition. Boeing Aircraft Company, a partner in the V-22 Joint Program Office and prime contractor for the V-22 aircraft, has the required technical data regarding the current VHATS configuration as well as the technical data for the required modifications to upgrade the hardware and software for the enhanced test procedures. Without this information, the Government and other manufacturers would be unable to perform the required modifications without incurring significant costs associated with reverse engineering. The Government intends to purchase the hardware, installation services, technical data, and software updates directly from the OEM. This is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract. The point of contact is Ms. Shannan Germond, shannan.germond@navy.mil.

The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and  other items and non-personal services necessary to perform  an Elevated Water Storage Tank Inspection and Evaluation as defined in the Performance Work Statement.  The intent of this effort is to provide professional services to perform a comprehensive exterior inspection and assessment of the current condition of an elevated 500,000-gallon (nominal) potable water storage tank and associated attached appurtenances located at the Fort Carson, Colorado, Pi on Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS). This tank was constructed in 1984-1985. The tank interior coating was recently (within the last two years) removed and replaced.  The exterior of this tank however consists of an original-construction sprayed-on insulation and paint coating system. A new exterior paint coating system was reapplied several years ago without removal or replacement of the insulation system.  Since that effort was undertaken it has become evident that corrosion is occurring beneath the insulation system as exhibited by surface staining in numerous locations on the exterior paint coating.  This tank, and the adjacent support building housing pumping and chlorination equipment, are currently operational facilities.  All work required to complete the contracted services shall be performed in a manner that maintains access, operational status and minimal interference of work activities of all existing facilities.  The objectives of the work in this effort include determination of the cause of these conditions; assessment of the extent and damage created by corrosion on the exterior shell of the tank and to propose potential rehabilitation efforts. Assessment of the damage shall include an evaluation of the remaining tank shell thickness, using non-destructive testing methods, which would remain following near-white blasting to remove all existing insulation and coatings. The evaluation shall result in a determination of whether the tank is "fit for intended service" or not and estimate the extent of expected spot or panel repairs that may be encountered during metal preparation (near-white sandblasting) prior to recoating the entire tank exterior.  It is important to note that the recoating of the entire tank exterior is not part of this contract.  Services shall include providing a video recording of the tank inspection, still photographs incorporated into a written report detailing the findings and conditions of the assessment. The report shall provide an assessment of the conditions of the exterior of the tank as well as identification of any deviations or deficiencies from current applicable tank construction standards that can be seen from exterior review (i.e. OSHA access or climbing provisions, tank overflow, etc.).  For all noted deviations or deficiencies, a proposed corrective measure(s) shall be identified and evaluated.  Services shall also include collection and analysis of samples of the exterior coating system(s) as well as the sprayed-on insulation system.  It is currently unknown whether asbestos insulation and/or lead-based primer or paint was used in the construction or subsequent recoating of this tank.  Sampling and analysis for the presence of asbestos and lead-based primer or paint shall be performed under this contract.  The results of that sampling/analysis shall be included in the written report.  Period of performance for this effort is ninety (90) days.<br><br>Offerors be advised of on-line registration requirement in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx and directed solicitation provisions concerning electronic annual On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov.  Representations and certifications are required to be updated annually as a minimum to keep information current.  Certifications are effective for one year from date of submission or update to ORCA.<br><br>Solicitation will be posted to the web via Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov)<br><br>Questions regarding contractual matters should be made to Don Miller 402-995-2051.

<SUBJECT>58--Hardware Modernization for the Combat Operations Center (COC)
<SOLNBR>M6785411R2233
<CONTACT>Edward McGrail 703-432-3148
<DESC>This Pre-solicitation Notice is being posted in advance of Solicitation No. M67854-11-R-2233 for the Combat Operations center (COC) Hardware Modernization Effort. The forthcoming solicitation will be issued on the basis of full and open competition. Information contained in this notice is subject to change. No proposals are being requested at this time. 

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement to procure and intends to issue a solicitation for Hardware Modernization in regards to the Combat Operations Center (COC). The COC Hardware Modernization will be procured under competitive procedures.  Utilizing the trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1, the best value for the Government will be obtained.
  Best Value award will be to the responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified in the solicitation.  This procurement is expected to result in one contract consisting of a Final Hardware Modernization ECP (F-ECP), a COC Variant 4 ([V]4) prototype/test modification kit, and one year base and optional ordering periods for three years for NET training and production per variant ([V]2, [V]3, and [V]4).  The contract will commence in the 4th Quarter of FY11. A "C" type contract will be issued with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost type CLINS.

The COC provides a fully functional transportable operational facility that integrates shelters, trailers, communications equipment, power generation and distribution systems, environmental control units, operational software programs, operator workstations, displays, intercommunications, and Local Area Network (LAN)/Wide Area Network (WAN) systems.
  The COC is currently fielded to Marine forces.  

The COC program supports the primary operational agency required to control the tactical operations of a command employing ground and aviation combat, combat support, and combat service support elements.  The COC provides transportable C2 facilities for the commander and staff of the Command Element, Ground Combat Element, Aviation Combat Element, and Logistics Combat Element in support of Marine Air Ground Task Force operations. The COC program minimizes the number of distinct equipment configurations, improving logistics supportability while maximizing operational flexibility and suitability for required echelon-specific functionality. 

There are three fielded COC system variants (V), all designed using a building block approach: (V)2 (Division/Wing/Marine Logistics Group Level), (V)3 (Regiment/Group Level), and (V)4 (Battalion/Squadron Level).
 The COC is composed of several variants with multiple hardware baselines.  Fielded systems include the Model D, E, and F (F0 through F5).  Upgrades to the existing hardware configurations will be required in order to accommodate virtualization; minimize the number of baseline configurations; reduce Size, Weight, And Power (SWAP); support for the Tactical Services Oriented Architecture (TSOA); and the adoption of available services produced by third party developers.  
 
Solicitation Number M67854-11-R-2233 is anticipated to be issued within the next 45 days and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https: www.neco.navy.mil.
 Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued. No phone calls will be accepted. In order to be eligible for award, interested parties must be registered into the Central Contractor Database (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov.


Any interested offeror is also hereby notified that MARCORSYSCOM intends to conduct an Industry Week conference which will be held on 24 May 2011 through 27 May 2011, commencing at 0900 hours at 7410-B Magi Road, Hanahan, South Carolina 29410.  The purpose of the conference is to provide information that may improve the understanding of the COC requirement, thereby assisting potential offerors in determining if or how they can satisfy the Governments requirements.
 

Interested parties are limited to 5 participants per company.  All participants must submit a visitor request to Brittany Smith at brittany.smith@navy.mil no later than 16 May 2010 in order to attend.  All participants must be US Citizens; no foreign nationals will be allowed to attend. More information regarding Industry Week Specifics will be provided to registered attendees after the May 16th deadline.

<DESC>The U.S. Army PEO Ground Combat Systems requests industry response to off-the-shelf integration ready data recorders.  PEO GCS plans to install data recorders or 'Black Boxes' into the combat vehicles.  The primary purpose of the black box is to measure the blast and acceleration forces inside the Driver's and Troop compartments during an event. Black Box must be capable of measuring, recording and storing vehicle motions and its characteristics when the vehicle exposed to kinetic energy, blast overpressures, shock, ballistic and impact events. The current plan is to integrate, test, field and install the Black Boxes on Stryker vehicles within 120 days of market response due date. The requirements for the Black Boxes are provided below: <br><br>1. Record vehicle structure acceleration data from IED and/or mine events on the combat vehicle's driver and vehicle's occupant compartments. <br><br>2. Capable of measuring, recording, storing and retrieving the blast data for all events Threshold(T) +/- 4000G Objective(O) +/- 6000G and rotational accelerations at 50,000 radians per second per full scale axis.<br><br>3. Operate in temperatures from -40 C(O) - 18  C(T) to +49  C(T) +55  C(O).<br><br>4. Operate with or without vehicle power. If not self contained, Electronic interface IAW industry standards (28V or 12V) but should provide backup power for 1 year (Power/low battery indication).<br><br>5. Be survivable, replaceable and serviceable in a tactical environment post event.<br><br>6. Accelerometers should be tri-axial mounted with an adjustable trigger response time above mobility impulse (>100G) within 1 microsecond and start recording within 10 microseconds. <br><br>7. Sampling rate shall be a minimum of 10 kHz with Anti-Alias filter. <br><br>8. Record minimum of 5 events, minimum of 5 seconds in duration for each event. <br><br>9. Ruggedized to survive Combat Vehicle environmental and harshness standards IAW Mil-Std-810 and designed to be electromagnetic hardened and meet electromagnetic interference testing requirements per MIL STD 461 sub test R101 and R103.<br><br>10. Data retrieval (~5 seconds) and analysis must be an open-architecture industry standard (for example but not limited to a USB port to a laptop or wireless to a non-proprietary software utility program or application) to allow for correlation with Army blast models.  <br><br>11. Internal clock capability with minimum of time/date stamp<br><br>12. Cost Rough order of magnitude: NRE, components, mounting hardware, packaging, special handling, software, etc   <br><br>13. Provide test data supporting system capabilities<br><br>14. Describe a general vehicle integration plan (size, weight, power, technical expertise, platform down time, tools, etc) with emphasis on minimum modifications to vehicle structure for field installation. Explain sensor mounting (solid vs mechanical filter) and include any maintenance items such as but not limited to built-in-tests, calibration requirements, trigger defaults/settings, etc. <br> <br>15. Describe earliest delivery time and production rate(s). <br><br>16. Separately describe any additional capability that could provide information characterizing the blast/mine event such as but not limited to overpressure, video, multiple configuration micro processor looping options will allow for actively operating in circular buffer -ready mode to record pre-trigger data (3-6 msec prior to event) for all accelerometer and pressure channels.    <br><br>	Responses are due to Contracting Center POC by 4:00 P.M. EDT 4 May 2011 and submitted electronically to Nancy Filary, 586-282-8373, nancy.filary@us.army.mil.<br><br>NOTE: This announcement constitutes a RFI notice for planning purposes IAW FAR 52.215-3.

The principal components of the work are as follows:
Pulverize existing bituminous surfacing from the Lower Portal Road (approx 18,500 square yards) and recycle as sub-base material.  Remove and dispose of approximately 900 linear feet of wooden guardrail and replace with galvanized steel guardrail (triple corrugation).  Remove approximately 275 linear feet of existing steel W-beam guardrail.  Salvage and/or recycle removed materials.  Shape, form, and line drainage ditches as required adjacent to the roadway to collect normal run-off from heavy rainstorms.  Install 24-inch corrugated metal pipe drainage culverts with appropriate sized metal flared inlet sections and riprap splash pads.  Upstream area shall include grating to prevent large debris from entering into the storm drain/culvert.  To minimize erosion, downstream end of culvert shall discharge onto a riprap splash pad or an area protected with large native rock.  Import aggregate base course (ABC) in accordance with Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) standard specifications.  Earthwork and excavation to remove rock, reshape embankment, and improve line of sight at blind curves.

The PLAS loan portfolio contains approximately 285,000 loans with an outstanding principle balance in excess of $16 billion.<br />PLAS is an online transaction entry and inquiry financial and accounting system accessed by over 2,500 service centers and the Finance Office (FO). Updates are done nightly in a batch mode. The FO is the primary user of PLAS and has overall operational, financial and accounting responsibility for Rural Development/FSA. Approximately 10 million transactions are process to the system annually with over 3.5 million of these transactions being loan payments. PLAS functions include: online inquiry and transaction input; loan making and loan servicing transaction updates; investor accounting; acquired property inventory; daily register, balancing and program reporting; and fiscal and financial reporting.<br />The PLAS hardware platform is an IBM System z10 Enterprise Class (z10EC) mainframe.

<DESC>PURPOSE: Special notice is to look for sources.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife, Region Seven (7), Alaska has a need for a firm-fixed price purchase for waterfowl harvest survey in the Yukon Delta NWR Region of Alaska to administer support to the AMBCC which is developing recommendations related to the spring/summer subsistence harvest of migratory birds.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Date of award through December 31, 2011.
BACKGROUND: The Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council (AMBCC) consists of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, and representatives of Alaska's indigenous inhabitants.  The AMBCC's primary purpose is to develop recommendations related to the spring/summer subsistence harvest of migratory birds.  Harvest monitoring is a necessary part of this process.  Data gathered through harvest monitoring is used to developing AMBCC recommendations and by ADF&G, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and Native organizations within the subsistence eligible areas.
In October 2000, the AMBCC appointed a harvest survey technical committee to design a standardized, annual statewide subsistence harvest survey.  In October 2003, the AMBCC approved the technical committee's Recommendations for a Statewide Migratory Bird Subsistence Harvest Survey.  These recommendations include a goal of survey consistency and standardization across regions of Alaska, a statewide administrative structure and a standardized harvest survey handbook.
GOAL/OBJECTIVE: Administer and disperse payment to surveyors based on payment requests that have been verified by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in a timely manner.  Accurate records of payments shall be maintained and prompt notification of the Service when payments are made.
TASKS: Operate an office for this work in Bethel, Alaska; maintain a list of harvest surveyors with names and addresses; provide prompt accurate payment based on verified payment requests; notify the Subsistence Harvest Survey coordinator that payments have been made; and request reimbursement from the Fish & Wildlife Service for services performed.
VENDOR REQUIREMENTS: Must be able to speak English and Yupik fluently, maintain an office in Bethel, Alaska for the duration of the contract, and have a developed relationship with the tribal communities of the Yukon Delta NWR area.
NOTE TO INTERESTED VENDORS: Any vendors that are interestd in and can provide proof of vendor requirements mentioned above contact Amanda Jordan @97-786-3436 or amanda_jordan@fws.gov.

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The USDA Forest Service is contemplating an upgrade of its aerial supervision fleet of airplanes utilized for initial attack, extended attack, and lead plane functions on wildfires. The purpose of this request for information is to conduct market research to determine if there are commercial airplanes (with or without modifications) available in the marketplace to fulfill the aerial supervision module performance requirements within reasonable pricing parameters, which may ultimately result in the issuance of a solicitation of competitive proposals for the dry lease of approximately 10 airplanes (with a possible increase of up to 20 airplanes), of the same model from a single vendor. The airplanes will be operated by Government employee pilots and fuel for the airplanes will be purchased by the Government. The airplanes will be maintained by the contractor/vendor. <br /><br /><strong>The following is a list of the basic minimum requirements needed for aerial platforms to fulfill the aerial supervision mission:</strong></p>
<p>- Airplanes must be turbine powered.<br />- Must be equipped with basic Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) equipment as defined by the FAA.<br />- Minimum flight endurance is 4 hours.<br />- Single or Multi-engine.<br />- Certified for Single Pilot by the FAA.<br />- Dual controls.<br />- Avionics: The airplanes must be capable of having the following standard avionics included in the airplanes: Glide Slope/Localizer, Two VHF-AM 760 Channel Communication/Navigation radios, Low Frequency Receiver, Transponder, IFR Approach Certified Global Positioning System, IFR Certified Autopilot, VHF-AM, Three Audio Selection Panels, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Advisory and Warning System (TAWS), Collision Avoidance System, and Cockpit Voice Recorder. <br />- The ability to add visibility enhancements to make the airplanes highly visible from ground to air and air to air (i.e., color and/or high intensity lighting).<br />- Air Conditioning.<br />- Demonstrated ability to deal with particulates/smoke found in the air environment over fires.<br />- Certificated by the FAA to operate in known icing conditions and to operate in <br />day and night Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).<br />- Meet the Federal Acquisition Act implementation of the Buy American Act and its exceptions for Government acquisition of airplanes.<br />- Airplanes must be in current production or nearing current production; or if not in current production, a minimum of 400 airplanes must have been produced with a production of date not in excess of ten (10) years from the date of the potential date of a new ASM contract award and with no more than 2,000 total airframe time.<br />- Airplanes must have been completely built by the manufacturer, i.e., no kit airplanes.<br />- Minimum Flight Deck capacity of two.<br />- Minimum cruise speed of 230 Knots True Airspeed (KTAS).<br />- Minimum maneuvering speed (Va) of 150 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS).<br />- Maximum stall speed (Vso) of 90 KIAS.<br />- Minimum Single Engine Service Ceiling of 12,500 ft. msl.</p>
<p>The airplanes have the potential to be operated at altitudes less than 500 feet above ground level, in mountainous terrain, with the normal turbulence associated with the wildfire environment.</p>

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</strong>
<p>Original Release Date: April 6, 2011<br />Administrative Update Release Date: April 20, 2011</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br />NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any responses to this RFI should be submitted by April 25, 2011 at 11:00 AM EST.</p>
<p>This notice consists of three parts:</p>
<p>Part I. Introduction<br />Part II. List of Attachments<br />Part III. How to Respond to this Notice</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This notice is a Request for Information (RFI). It is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201 ("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals"). FAR 11.101 ("Order of precedence for requirements documents") requires agencies to develop requirements documents to meet agency needs that utilize performance-oriented documents based on voluntary industry consensus standards to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>FAR Subpart 37.6, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting"(Oct. 1998), encourage agencies to use performance-based contracting methods that describe work requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, establish objective measurable performance standards for key elements of the work, use a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) to measure work accomplishment against the standards, and use performance incentives to encourage contractors to meet and/or exceed the referenced standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to take immediate action to govern the appropriate use and oversight of contract types to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts. OFPP's memorandum "Increasing Competition and Structuring Contracts for Best Results" (Oct. 2009) encourages agencies to collaborate with industry, use performance-based acquisitions, choose the best contract type for acquisitions, and use incentives to motivate lower costs in cost-type arrangements.</p>
<p>These referenced documents may be accessed electronically at the OFPP website located at <br />http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/. Please frame any responses to this notice in accordance with the policies contained in these references.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.   This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service  The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) has an anticipated acquisition for monitoring and evaluation services.
Purpose and Background
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information from qualified organizations which can show a demonstrated capacity to provide monitoring and evaluation (M&E) services, particularly in the development of 1) Performance Management Plans; 2) Evaluation Plans, including impact evaluations; and 3) M&E based data collection in developing countries around the world, including fragile market economies such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Haiti and Iraq.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS), Office of Capacity Building and Development (OCBD) has, over the past two years, worked to build a results oriented management (ROM) approach within its international capacity building programs. Using this approach, FAS programs seek to improve program planning, measuring, monitoring and reporting by focusing on intended outcomes or results and not just implementation of activities. ROM will help to ensure management decisions are based on strong evidence and improve accountability, transparency and learning of FAS programs. As part of the development of ROM, FAS projects will be required to develop a strong M&E system including a performance management and evaluation plans.
FAS interventions are varied and include capacity building of national and local governments, farmers, communities, schools and teachers; direct service provision including for example school meals and take home rations, microfinance, and health interventions; awareness raising; infrastructure development; and research. Grants are awarded to a variety of organizations that implement these interventions, including foreign governments, NGOs, universities, International Organizations, local organizations and private for profits. FAS programs are implemented in developing countries around the world including in fragile market economies such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Haiti and Iraq.
FAS/OCBD is requesting cost estimates from experienced vendors that provide monitoring and evaluation data collection services. A general description of what the monitoring and evaluation data collection services will likely entail is described below. FAS/OCBD foresees two types of M&E data collection to be carried out by its programs. The first is data collection related to identified and agreed upon indicators (either qualitative or quantitative) on outcomes for measuring key results of the project. The second form of data collection FAS/OCBD anticipates collecting is related to the conduct of outcome and impact evaluations.
Monitoring Indicator Data Collection
FAS/OCBD foresees the collection of data for approximately 9-15 standard indicators and approximately 5-10 project specific indicators. These indicators will be used to track, throughout the duration of the project, whether the project is achieving the specified desired results and whether their performance is on target. Work may also entail the development and conduct of surveys and assessments, including baseline data collection, beneficiary assessments, market surveys, and knowledge, attitudes and behavior surveys (KABS) or other assessments. The data collection process will require the development of tools for the collection of monitoring information including methodological plans, terms of references (TOR), questionnaires, interviewer protocols, data collection handbooks/guidelines for implementing partners, and analysis plans. 
FAS/OCBD also expects it will require the development of an electronic data collection and reporting system, possibly web-based, that will be used to collect, store, and retrieve data and information and be used by the grantee and USDA as an analytical tool for meeting regular reporting requirements, learning, and making informed project management decisions. This will help build the capacity of the grantee to ensure continued and effective monitoring and evaluation without the assistance of a Contractor.
Evaluation Data Collection
FAS anticipates the conduct of outcome and impact evaluations which will be used to identify the short and long-term impact of its interventions. The purpose of FAS evaluations is to ensure accountability of the organization's efforts and improve learning to identify not only what works but why it works. 
Evaluation methodologies will vary but may include experimental and quasi-experimental designs that include an intervention and control group, including randomized evaluations. The work will require expertise in managing the evaluation and data collection (including baseline data), in the field, working directly with USDA's grantees, verifying data quality and preparing clean data sets, for analysis and public consumption.
FAS anticipates evaluation data collection will include the need for a TOR to be developed for the evaluation, an evaluation methodological plan, timing of evaluation data collection, conduct baseline data collection and one follow-up data collection, an analysis plan, and final report after each data collection.
Pricing
FAS is seeking maximum and minimum pricing information on the activities proposed above by region and for specific countries within a region. For a list countries by region see: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#ftna. FAS is seeking the following pricing information:

<DESC>Notice Type: Request for Information<br />Special Notice Synopsis
<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p><br />52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>(b) Your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This solicitation is issued for (see 1.1 below).</p>
<p>1.1 PURPOSE</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and NOT a solicitation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is seeking to improve current NRC licensing processes for safety-related digital instrumentation and control (DI&amp;C) system technologies.</p>
<p>Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request to industry and academia for information on approaches, products, technologies, and/or solutions for incorporating into NRC DI&amp;C system licensing activities a safety assurance case approach. All interested sources are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p><br />1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Safety assurance case solutions must be able to be integrated into current NRC licensing processes such that ongoing NRC licensing commitments are not adversely affected. Included in the integration solutions is a requirement for long term maintenance of the approaches, products, technologies, and/or solutions augmented with NRC staff training and certification capabilities.</p>
<p>Initial operating capability is envisioned in the FY12 to FY13 timeframe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.0 DISCUSSION</p>
<p>2.1 CURRENT NRC LICENSING CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>To ensure protection of public safety and security and protection of the environment, the <br />NRC requires nuclear power plants (NPPs) to be designed with barriers to the release of radioactivity (i.e., fuel rod cladding, primary system coolant piping, the containment building, and an exclusion zone between the plant and the off-site boundary). To ensure protection of these barriers, generic design criteria (GDC) in Appendix A, Generic Design Criteria, to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Energy, Part 50, Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities (10CFR50) for currently operating NPPs and Part 52, Early Site Permits; Standard Design Certifications; and Combined Licenses for Nuclear Power Plants (10CFR52) for new reactor designs define design features that must be addressed in NPP designs. Additionally, other 10CFR50 and 10CFR52 regulatory requirements specify restrictions on the conditions under which a NPP must operate. These sets of requirements and restrictions form the bases for NPP licensing activities.</p>
<p>In general, a safety assurance case is developed by <br /><br />1) identifying events that could affect safety adversely; <br />2) describing the method(s) for preventing or mitigating each event; <br />3) defining the process(es) for confirming the acceptance criteria have been met appropriately; and <br />4) specifying the acceptance criteria needed to obtain reasonable assurance that the event has been addressed acceptably.</p>
<p>The NPP owner is required to prove the NPP will not expose the public to more radioactivity than a specified threshold value as a result of normal plant operations, specific abnormal operating occurrences (AOOs) (e.g., losses of offsite power), and specific design basis events (DBEs) (e.g., losses of coolant caused by breaks in the coolant boundary). The combination of AOOs and DBEs comprise the set of licensing basis events. AOOs are events that are expected to occur at least once during the life of a plant. DBEs are events that are not expected to occur during the life of a plant. The means by which normal plant operations are controlled and AOOs and DBEs are mitigated comprise the plant safety assurance case.</p>
<p>To ensure NPPs are operated safely, safety systems and safety features are incorporated into NPP designs to protect the integrity of the radioactivity release barriers by 1) controlling nuclear power to prevent nuclear fuel damage; 2) maintaining core cooling to protect the fuel rod cladding from failing; 3) reducing stresses on the coolant system piping and the containment to protect these barriers from failing; and 4) isolating containment penetrations to minimize the release of radioactivity. <br />Additionally, NRC regulations require licensees to maintain emergency notification systems and public evacuation procedures to extend the distance between the public and the NPP if excessive releases of radioactivity could occur upon a failure of radioactivity release barriers.<br /><br />Clause 55a(h) of 10CFR50 requires licensees to develop safety-related instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) systems in accordance with criteria specified in IEEE Std 603-1991, IEEE Standard Criteria for Safety Systems in Nuclear Power Generating Stations. These criteria address topics such as equipment qualification, seismic qualification, capability to function with a single failure, separation and independence, implementing digital safety systems, etc. IEEE Std 603 daughter standards and NRC regulatory guidance provide further clarification of the requirements in IEEE Std 603. These daughter standards include IEEE Std 323, IEEE Std 344, IEEE Std 379, IEEE Std 384, and IEEE Std 7 4.3.2, respectively.</p>
<p>The NRC licensing reviews of NPP safety systems are guided by Chapter 7, Instrumentation and Control Systems, of NUREG 0800, Standard Review Plan (SRP). Chapter 7 provides NRC staff guidance for reviewing licensing applications for safety systems. Additionally, Chapter 7 provides references to the following guidance documents:</p>
<p>1. Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) positions, <br />2. NRC guidance for the nuclear industry in NRC Regulatory Guides (RGs), <br />3. NRC staff guidance reports and contractor reports (NUREGs and NUREG/CRs, respectively), <br />4. Endorsed industry consensus standards, and<br />5. Branch Technical Positions (BTPs) on specific regulatory positions.</p>
<p>Included in the set of BTPs are topics addressing, for example, software licensing review processes (BTP 7-14), which guide NRC staff through three stages of the software licensing review: process documentation, process implementation, and design product review. Further review guidance is provided in regulatory guides endorsing IEEE standards for verification and validation, configuration management, software quality assurance, etc. The expectation is that following the review process described in BTP 7-14 enables the staff to conclude that a proposed software-based digital safety system acceptably satisfies the NPP safety objectives.</p>
<p>Reviewing license applications for DI&amp;C safety systems has been challenging for the NRC because of the extensive regulatory requirements and guidance comprising the licensing review process. For example, in BTP 7-14 above there are approximately 190 criteria the staff <br />considers in reviewing the adequacy of the safety assurance case for a safety-related software system. Further compounding this issue is that there is not a set format for specifying safety system assurance cases.</p>
<p>Uncertainties in the assurance of DI&amp;C systems for safety functions in a variety of application domains have been shown to arise from systemic causes, such as in software. In order to learn from experiences outside of the commercial NPP industry, the NRC elicited knowledge from experts with safety-critical software and systems research experience in industries such as defense, space flight, commercial aviation, medical devices, automobiles, telecommunications, and railways. The NRC, with the assistance of its contractor, Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) interviewed over 30 experts from seven countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Canada, United States, Australia, and New Zealand), from which a diverse group of 10 experts were charged with the following objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify limitations in the current state of practice (i.e., sources of uncertainty) that make software assurance heavily dependent on expert judgment.<br />&bull; Identify the evidence that is needed to assure software for safety more effectively, based on best practices in other application domains.<br />&bull; Identify knowledge gaps to be filled (i.e., areas in need of research and development) to enable more consistent reviews and to reduce judgment-based variation.</p>
<p>The applicant for certification or license should demonstrate the satisfaction of the safety assurance case goal through a logical (argument-based) organization and integration of the evidence from verification, validation, and audit activities. This demonstration is sometimes called a "safety demonstration" and, in some communities, it is known as an "assurance case" and for the whole system a "safety case".</p>
<p>2.2 INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>The NRC is requesting that the following information be provided:</p>
<p>1. A description and discussion of company capabilities with respect to fulfilling the objectives outlined in this RFI;<br />2. Experience with developing or adopting a safety assurance case approach into a DI&amp;C licensing or certification process;<br />3. An identification of shortfalls in the proposed solution relative to the requirements for integrating a safety assurance case into the existing DI&amp;C safety system licensing process and an approach to improving the performance in the licensing process;<br />4. How a pilot or demonstration or partial review might be structured to assess feasibility of the process; and<br />5. Any additional information that will assist in understanding your responses to the RFI.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Energy Resources Science Center is leading a partnership with industry for projects in Alaska, where drilling and measuring the amount of methane hydrates are critical USGS scientific goals.  Numerous wells on the north slope of Alaska are currently being drilled and samples will be acquired for the USGS. As a result of these drilling projects, our research drilling will generate a large number of geochemical samples that will require analysis of gas composition.  To retain compatibility with the new sample set, it is imperative that USGS make interpretations with retained data, and to maintain the integrity of our interpretations of new gas data by eliminating intra-laboratory variance from the data analysis. Isotech Labs have generated previous historical gas data utilized by the USGS gas hydrate project in Alaska. Isotech has  unique capabilities to analyze gas samples using various systems, including; high-precision offline prep systems, utilizing dual inlet mass spectrometry techniques for carbon and hydrogen isotope measurement of specific hydrocarbons, plus multiple state of the art online GC-C-IRMS systems for carbon isotope and hydrogen isotope analysis. Isotech Labs calibrations of gas chromatograph systems are specifically designed for compositional analysis of natural gas samples.
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from Isotech Laboratories and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by May 2, 2011 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source award in accordance to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), authorized or required by statue. The Cincinnati VA Medical Center requires the Updated Enterprise Edition Software Package to update Electronic Medication Pumps being used to dispense Medication for the Methadone Clinic. If the Mental Health Service were to lose AMS services & support, it would result in an increase in medication error, and a decrease in patient satisfaction. The government intends  to make an award to sole source this upgrade requirement to NetSmart NY Inc. The proposed contract action is for the updated software package to be used on NetSmart Hardware that was previously purchased to dispense medication for the Methadone Clinic. The Government intends to award to only one source (NetSmart NY Inc.) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). This is a proprietary software packaged available exclusively through the manufacturer. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Metallurgy Division, intends to negotiate with Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp.; Providence, RI, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to procure a renewal of the license described below.</p>
<p>Background: <br />NIST currently uses a finite element modeling software called Abaqus. The Metallurgy Division has been using this software extensively and has written simulations and macro-programs that can be run only by using Abaqus. Isight works directly with Abacus to explore how systems respond to varying conditions.</p>
<p>NIST requires a renewal of the Abaqus+Isight license for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. Recent market research shows that the license renewal can be provided only through Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp.</p>
<p>Replacing Abaqus with another finite element analysis program may create a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and would also create a delay in performance as it would require staff to be retrained and require additional time for all simulations to be converted into the new program.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Dassault Systemes for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide the licenses necessary may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before April 29, 2011 at 4 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

<p>2. PART II - PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - (a) Only relevant references for same or similar type contracts are desired. Submit three (3) recent (within the last 3 years) past performance references. (b) In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems.</p>

<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

						(End of clause)<BR><BR>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (NOV 2008):  If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Bahnson Environmental Specialists, 4412 Tryson Road, Raleigh, NC 27606, for a 74 cu. Ft. animal holding chamber 2 degrees C to 70 degrees C with the following operational specifications:
<p>Operational <br />&bull; ES standard chambers are built to meet or exceed MET&#63720;(NRTL), UL-61010 standards for safety and performance. Note: MET&#63720; listing may not be provided for options designated by (-S Suffix). Please contact Sales for further information. <br />&bull; All Doublewide chambers are shipped in sections and require field assembly. <br />&bull; 208-230V / 1&Oslash; / 30A (requires neutral) <br />&bull; Operational range is considered as 2 - 70 C, with humidity performance from 10 - 96%, and the following limits: <br />o Volumetric uniformity +/-2C and +/-5% RH <br />o Low end humidity is limited by a 50 F dewpoint; 10% lowest. <br />o High end humidity is limited by a 95 F dewpoint; 96% highest. <br />o Humidity limits are based upon ambient of 77 F, 50% RH, and a make-up air amount of nominal 25 CFM. <br />o Humidity limitations are listed below are based on terrestrial limits in nature; i.e. 70 C. and 96% would not exist in nature.</p>
<p>&#61607; 2&deg;C, 96% <br />&#61607; 10&deg;C, 96% <br />&#61607; 25&deg;C, 39% - 96% <br />&#61607; 40&deg;C, 17% - 75% <br />&#61607; 55&deg;C, 10% - 36% <br />&#61607; 70&deg;C, 10% - 18%</p>
<p>&bull; Interior lighting is provided as LED light strips along the back corners. A light switch is located in the control panel at the top of the chamber. On/off timing (example 12 on, 12 off) can be provided through the main control screen programming. <br />&bull; All exposed interior components are provided as 304SS for cleanability and corrosion resistance. The coil is provided with Electrofin coating for corrosion resistance. <br />&bull; For all interior sealing, a water based silicone will be used. No VOC based sealant will be used. <br />&bull; Make-up air is provided by inlet and exhaust ports at the top, rear of the chamber. The vent opening is adjustable to approximately 20 CFM, maximum, of make-up air. Note that higher CFM's are not supported with the current humidification system or with the current cooling system. Low end operation is limited to 5 C (due to excessive coil icing at lower temperature conditions. Further note that all incoming and exhaust air is HEPA filtered, as detailed below. <br />&bull; All recirculated and make-up air is HEPA filtered (99.99%) via filters located on the supply wall inside of the chamber, for ease of access. All return air to the coil and fan is pre-filtered (30%) on the return wall inside of the chamber; pre-filtration will remove dander and other airborn elements, and prevent clogging of the HEPA. <br />o Note that the chamber is not designed for stringent &lsquo;HEPA filter challenges' as may be required for pharmaceutical applications only. <br />&bull; A full-view glass door is provided, with nominal viewing dimensions of 30" x 68". This will allow viewing of the usable volume of the chamber (which is approximately 32" wide x 60" high). <br />&bull; For reduction of vibration and interior noise, the following features are provided: <br />o Design flowrate of 250 CFM for low velocity across the cages and low noise <br />o Motor speed control for flow balancing and lower RPM, i.e. lower vibration <br />o Motor mount with neoprene / rubber mounting pad</p>
<p>o Compressor body with special vibration isolators <br />o Proportioning hot gas valve in lieu of on/off cycling valves <br />o Heavy duty shelving for cages and to avoid vibration from lightweight materials (additional shelf padding is recommended to be supplied by the user)</p>
<p>&bull; A single access port is provided on the rear of the chamber, upper right corner, rear wall. <br />&bull; Interior watering system is not provided at this time. <br />&bull; NEMA power cord and receptacle is included.</p>
<p>Site Requirements <br />&bull; The size of the unit should be reviewed closely as related to the passage of unit through doorways, halls, etc. See Specification Sheet/Brochure for applicable information on unit and site requirements. <br />&bull; Site should be a controlled temperature/humidity area. Optimum performance at 78&deg;F / 50% RH. Refer to Specification Sheet for chamber heat rejection. <br />&bull; Site modifications, site installation and utilities are the responsibility of others. <br />&bull; All units with a "C" designation are furnished with air-cooled condensing units. Ventilation of the unit is by others. <br />&bull; All electrical connections must be made in accordance with NEC&#63720; and local codes. Site preparation requires a stable (&plusmn; 5%) voltage supply as specified by the submittal documents or equipment specification sheets. A dedicated circuit from the power panel to the equipment is required that is completely isolated from other electrical equipment. Circuit must be free of high frequency noise or voltage transients (spikes) greater than 2.0Vac. The neutrals and grounds are to be continuous from circuit breaker panel to chamber control panel. Neutral to ground voltages greater than 2.0Vac can cause controller resets. <br />&bull; All ES2000 chambers, temperature only and temperature/relative humidity have condensate except our ES2000A model. Please see options for removal of condensate. As standard, floor drains are required by others. Condensate drain lines are stubbed outside of chamber for connection by others. <br />&bull; Optional heated condensate pans or condensate pumps require a 110-120V wall receptacle provided by others. Maximum distance for condensate pump is 50' horizontal runs and 15' vertical runs.</p>
<p>Water Requirements <br />&bull; Units with relative humidity control require a pure water source for the steam generator. <br />&bull; ES prefers RO water or low grade DI water as opposed to mixed bed ultra-pure DI. Water requirements: Purified water supplied to the Reach-In chamber must meet the following quality criteria: Hardness / total dissolved solids (CaCO3) = &lt; 20 ppm, Resistance = 25,000 to 15,000,000 ohms-cm, pH = &gt; 6.0, Chlorides &lt; 20 mg/L, and Free Chlorine = 0 ppm (trace), Iron &lt; 0.1 mg/L. The steady-state design feed water flowrate per chamber is a maximum of 0.5 gallons per hour, at a required pressure range of 10 - 25 PSIG. <br />&bull; ES will offer, free of charge, testing of water for pH, iron, TDS, hardness and chlorine. ES cannot test for conductivity as this must be site verified. <br />&bull; Chamber warranty does not cover damages or failures caused by water quality that does not meet ES standards. Failure to meet the water quality limits will result in voiding of the humidification system warranty. <br />&bull; Contact ES Sales for available options if site location does not meet the water quality limits. <br />&bull; Periodic maintenance is required for all water systems in order to consistently meet ES water quality standards. Failure to provide documented maintenance, whether performed in-house or by external vendors, will result in voiding of the humidification system warranty.</p>
<p>General <br />&bull; 13-month warranty from date of shipment on parts and labor is standard.</p>
<p>CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

Place of performance is Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at destination, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Delivery shall be no later than 20 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-50. A redacted copy of the required brand-name justification is included within this announcement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for small business concerns, and the associated NAICS code is 541511 with a SBA size standard of $25 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities different than requested or products other than those requested will be deemed technically unacceptable. Please provide your best and final offer (BAFO) as the Government does not intend to conduct negotiations.</p>

<p>Redacted Justification: The initial procurement investigated thirty eight asset management applications but narrowed the field to only four viable options based on our evaluation criteria which were (1) Acquisition-Supports the contracting life cycle of an asset from purchase thru retirement of the asset as well as software license tracking throughout the life cycle of the software; (2) Supported our operating systems-Solaris, Windows, MAC, and Linux; (3) provided features such as searching inside PDFs, customized reports, and document upload (4) Security- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory groups control as well as support for STIG compliance. Upon further research, we could only confirm after testing within our in-house lab that the Altiris Asset Management product fully supported our evaluation criteria. It was also the only product that included a STIG module within their suite of products. Finally, maintaining the current software in place is more cost effective than purchasing and implementing alternative software.</p>
<p>Potential offeror shall be an authorized Symantec Corporation partner and source directly through Symantec, or Symantec authorized channels only, per standard commercial industry practices. Quotes that do not meet this requirement shall be considered technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Place "SP4707-11-Q-0043" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by April 25, 2011 at 1:00 PM EST. Responses are due by April 27, 2011 at 4:00 PM EST. Please include your Cage Code with your quote. Questions and/or quotations may be submitted by e-mail to David Stemple, the primary point of contact for this announcement, at david.stemple@dla.mil, or by FAX: (269) 961-4226.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Oral Airways. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source(s) for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for this standardization effort.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and 808-433-3686.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Oral Airways. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $118,184.77. This forecast is based on historical Medical Product Data Bank (MEDPDB) sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, forty one (41) line items of the total two hundred (200) line items, account for 77% ($85,567.51) of the total volume in sales ($118,184.77) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 41lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />A<strong> vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will be required to provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor that does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong> The MMESO Pacific will request responses to the technical/company requirements, no charge literature, no charge sample sets, and best available pricing from each interested vendor.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>

The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely unacceptable, two (2)-overwhelmingly unacceptable, three (3)-partially unacceptable, four (4)-acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. Vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those Vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Vendor that has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each evaluator will evaluate each Oral Airway product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting.<br />There will be approximately twenty (20) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below:<br />1. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety in Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine Practice) The device allows easy insertion into the mouth.<br />2. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety in Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine Practice) The device is kink-resistant to maintain stability and facilitate the movement of air into the lungs.<br />3. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety in Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine Practice) The device is easily removed by pulling it out of the mouth.<br />4. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety in Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine Practice) The package is easily identifiable as to size and type of the product.<br />5.

(Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety in Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine Practice) The product is easy to use and is durable.<br />7. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety in Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine Practice) The package is easy to open.<br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing must be submitted to the MMESO Pacific, and must be received by 5:00 PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. <br />The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of each MMESO. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</p>

<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO North, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO North via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. All vendors must send the MMESO North verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</span></strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of each type and size listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation. <br />TUBE ENDOTRACHEAL ORAL/NASAL CUFFED 7.0mm ID MURPHY PVC <br />TUBE ENDOTRACHEAL ORAL/NASAL CUFFED 7.5mm ID MURPHY PVC <br />TUBE ENDOTRACHEAL ORAL/NASAL CUFFED 8.0mm ID MURPHY PVC <br />TUBE ENDOTRACHEAL ORAL/NASAL UNCUFFED 3.5mm ID MURPHY PVC<br />TUBE ENDOTRACHEAL ORAL/NASAL CUFFED 4.5mm ID MURPHY PVC <br />The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Endotracheal Tube product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. Vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those Vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty (20) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.</p>
<p>1) (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety/Safety in Anesthesia Practice, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and FDA-recognized standard, ISO5361) The endotracheal tube is available and easily identified by the correct sizes. <br />2) (Clinician Efficiency of Care /Patient Safety/Safety in Anesthesia Practice, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and FDA-recognized standard, ISO5361) The integrity of the inflation system is verified by injecting air/gas into the cuff and no leakage is audible. <br />3) (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety/Safety in Anesthesia Practice, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and FDA-recognized standard, ISO5361) The endotracheal tube is sufficiently flexible/pliable and easily bent to conform to the contours of the laryngoscope blade and trachea. <br />4) (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety/Safety in Anesthesia Practice, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and FDA-recognized standard, ISO5361) After insertion, the cuff is inflated and maintains its proper placement. <br />5) (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety/Safety in Anesthesia Practice, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and FDA-recognized standard, ISO5361) The endotracheal tube connector easily fits an anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing must be received at the MMESO North by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50, March 16, 2011. The Government intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a single Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract with one (1) base year and two (2) option years. The subsequent contract will be awarded using FAR Part 13.5 procedures.<br><br>This solicitation is for a non-personal health care services contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical, professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The contractor indemnifies the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Government requires the contractor to maintain medical liability insurance, in coverage amounts which are not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services, contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. The minimum of $3,000 shall be ordered on this contract and the maximum contract amount over the life of the contract, including all options if exercised, is $400,000. The minimum contract amount of $3,000 may be met by one or more orders during the base year of the contract.<br><br>Primary place of performance is Togus VA Hospital, Augusta, ME, with periodic performance at various armory locations throughout the State of Maine. The capability of contractors to provide mobile-based medical services for any and all specialities in the contract is desired. Description of requirement: The Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) requires Periodic Health Assessments (PHA) to include: dental screening and treatment, immunization updating, physical exams, phlebotomy, vision screening, womens health screening and MEDPROS and DENCLASS systems updating of service members during a one (1) year base period beginning 27 April 2011, the anticipated award date, with two (2) option years exercised at the discretion of the Government. The government may inspect facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. (MEDPROS and DENCLASS are available through the Army Medical Operation Data System [MODS] at www.mods.army.mil.) Performance Standards: In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, the contractor shall provide, in a fixed or mobile setting, all management, labor, material, personal equipment, certifications and supplies necessary to provide Medical services, dental examinations, dental treatments, health and dental record updating, MEDPROS and DENCLASS updating. <br><br>The first anticipated task order against the resulting ID/IQ contract is planned for 30 April 2011.<br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made based on an evaluation of the criteria of price, past performance and technical capability. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price; 2) Past Performance; 3) Technical Capability. A consideration when evaluating technical capability will be continuity of personnel offered by the contractor. Continuity of personnel will limit the need for constant training of new personnel month to month. Past Performance and Technical Capability, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements through past performance at similar events (assessing military members for medical fitness to standards in accordance with Army Regulation 40-501, chapter 3, 7 and 8), either as the prime or first tier subcontractor, and by identification of key personnel that have past performance experience. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br>Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): <br>Priced 0001, Physician Services<br>Priced 0002, Physician Assistant / Nurse Practioner Services<br>Priced 0003, Registered Nurse Services<br>Priced 0004, Phlebotomist Services<br>Priced 0005, Dentist Services<br>Priced 0006, Optometrist Services<br>Priced 0007, Mobile medical/dental exam facilities<br>Priced 0008, Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement (yearly requirement).

<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.

SPECIFICATIONS:
BackgroundThe USGS, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan, has a need to collect surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance geophysical soundings to gather information on the presence or absence of groundwater in different regions of the country.  The purpose of this work is to identify aquifers with economically recoverable water supplies in Afghanistan for the Afghan government, who will include this information in a bidding package provided to potential water resource developers in order to ensure bids that are more accurate.
Technical Specifications1)	One magnetic resonance transmitter/receiver unit with at least 4 Tx/Rx capable channels with a 24-bit or better AD converter, 4 ms or shorter measurement dead-time, at least 4000 Volt maximum transmitter coil voltage, at least 600 Amp maximum current output, allow for at least 25Amp*second transmitter pulse moments, and have a maximum of 0.4 nV/sqrt(Hz) receiver input noise.  All channels should be wideband with high input impedances. 
2)	One DC/DC power converter with capability of supplying a bus voltage of 500 V or greater (differential), instantaneously, as the source of charge and current to the transmitter.  The system should include a 540 V DC power supply that sources up to +/- 270V DC to the transmitter at the same time.  The transmitter should switch current in alternating directions through the coil to produce a coil voltage current equivalent to a +/- 540V DC supply and have greater than or equal to 0.05 F capacitance.
3)	Transmitter loop impedance tuning capability with capacitors ranging from 16-0.25 F allowing for fine loop tuning within a wide range of survey configurations and geographic locations.
4)	Field grade laptop, similar in durability and functionality to a Panasonic Toughbook 52, for instrument operation and data storage.
5)	Magnetic resonance acquisition software package including instrument control, noise cancellation, signal conditioning, and 1-D inversion capability.
6)	Magnetic resonance system connector cables in a case (Pelican).
7)	Six 150 m long wire reels with #10 wire with 4kVDC capability with abrasion-resistant polyurethane insulation and female connectors.  Wire must be high voltage environmentally-rated.
8)	Six 100 m long wire reels with #8 wire with 4kVDC capability with abrasion-resistant polyurethane insulation and female connectors.  Wire must be high voltage environmentally-rated.
9)	4-channel expansion unit to add 4 Tx/Rx channels to base channel capability for an integrated system with 8 full duplex transmit/receiver channels.  All channels should exhibit identical wideband receiver spectral characteristics.
10)	Additional DC/DC power converter unit to increase efficiency of long transmitter pulses.
11)	To ensure the safety and welfare of operators and bystanders, the instrument should automatically render itself inoperable, and should quickly and automatically dissipate any stored energy, if any high voltage terminal on the DC converter, tuning unit, or transmitter is exposed.  To maximize safety to the field crew and bystanders, the cables should be able to be normally connected and disconnected without touching the electrical contacts.
12)	Regarding size and weight, each component should be able to be safely lifted by two persons.  No individual components should exceed 100 lbs.
13)	Delivery of system by May 31, 2011
14)	2-year warranty from shipping date on defects in design and manufacture of instrumentation and software.
15)	Software upgrades, as such upgrades are released, for 2 years on basic magnetic resonance software package including instrument control, noise cancellation, and 1-D inversion.
16)	Technical support by phone and email.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUNE 2008) <br />Offerors are to submit their quotes as follows: <br /><br />Volume I- Technical Quote shall contain (1) copy of the company Quality Control Manual, Past Performance, &amp; Delivery time in days for the manufacture, spares, repairs and modifications for each panel. <br /><br />Volume II- Price Quote shall include the proposed pricing information IAW the attached Price Quote Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions apply:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision- <br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. <br />"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means- <br />(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and <br />(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). <br />(b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000. <br />(c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information: <br />(1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: <br />(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction. <br />(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. <br />(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in- <br />(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or <br />(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. <br />(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. <br />(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. <br />(d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). <br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (Alt IV) (OCT 1997).</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability- Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p>1. Quality Control:- The contractor shall provide verification that they possess Quality Control procedures and certifications applicable to the services being requested.</p>
<p>2. OEM Procedures:- The contractor shall provide verification that they have the capability to manufacture, repair and modify the panels, have the capability to produce all requested documentation and have the capability to provide technical support.<br /><br />USCG Evaluation of Technical Capability: Evaluation of vendor's technical capability shall include evaluation by the USCG New Product Development Branch. The evaluation will include in-depth analysis of the vendor's capability to complete the work being solicited to include: facilities, personnel, and associated processes (Quality Control, inventory management, etc.). This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit. Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be further considered for contract award.</p>
<p>This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for possible contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: Only offerors successfully meeting the technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: delivery, past performance (relevant and recent) and price.</p>
<p>Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.</p>
<p>Delivery: The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work. Delivery times in days for the manufacture, spares, repairs and modifications for each panel will be evaluated. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date for all items will be rated higher, with offerors that can meet or exceed the government's desired delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Price: The contractor shall provide pricing based on the manufacture of first articles, unit price of sparing, repair prices, test and evaluation prices, modification prices and labor rates for unusual damage, technical support, product improvement/engineering change proposal, service bulletins as requested in the attached quote sheet titled "HSCG38-10-Q-200169 Quote Sheet". Total price evaluation will be for the Base and all four Option periods. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG-2009), <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Best Value Evaluation. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made based on a Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) approach. <br />(a) Technical Acceptability: The Government will first evaluate the Technical Acceptability of all timely quotes. Vendors shall quote on all line items in the Bid Schedule. Any response/quotation that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates line item will be provided at no charge will be rejected as Technically Unacceptable. A vendor's quote/response will be determined technically acceptable if it meets the requirements of this paragraph and the following factor is determined Technically Acceptable. Any quote that fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph or is rated technically unacceptable in the factor below will be technically unacceptable overall and will be ineligible for award.<br />(i) Factor 1: Technical Evaluation. In order to be determined Technically Acceptable for this factor, vendors must provide a quote on line items. Item quotes must list the manufacturer and part number and must be accompanied by literature and/or a brochure including photographs and/or drawings. The descriptive literature must demonstrate how the proposed meets the characteristics listed in the PWS. <br />(b) Evaluation: Next, the Government will conduct a price evaluation of all Technically Acceptable quotes. The price evaluation will consist of a comparison of all Technically Acceptable quotes submitted with each other. Prices will be ranked by total evaluated price. <br />5. Best Value Determination. The lowest priced technically acceptable quote/response will be determined to represent the Best Value. Award will be made to the vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among all technically acceptable quotes.<br />6. "Descriptive Literature" FAR 52.214-21, applies to this RFQ. Descriptive literature is required with any submission. Failure to provide descriptive literature will be cause for rejection of your quote. Additionally, if the descriptive literature fails to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the quote.<br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. Addendum: The following paragraph is tailored as follows: Para (c), Period for Acceptance of Quotes. The vendor agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days for the date specified for receipt of quotes. Interested parties may submit a written offer in accordance with FAR 52.212-1. Offers submitted orally will not be accepted. Your quote must include discount terms, delivery date, tax identification number, cage code, and DUNS number.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. (Jan 1999) The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) Technical Acceptability (2) Price. The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance with the technical acceptability carrying significantly more weight than price. Only firm-fixed price offers will be evaluated. The Government will first evaluate the technical acceptability of all offers. Award will be made to the vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among all technically acceptable quotes. Award shall be made to that vendor without further consideration of any other quote.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with vendors. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; <br><br>proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will <br><br>not be issued. Solicitation W912L2-11-T-0011 is being issued <br><br>as a Request for Quotation.  This solicitation incorporates <br><br>provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through <br><br>Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42.  The associated NAICS <br><br>code is 611699, unrestricted.  COMMERCIAL ITEM DESCRIPTION:  <br><br>The USPFO for Arizona has a requirement for Professional <br><br>Development Training Workshop, curriculum, and customized <br><br>educational materials associated with the Combat and <br><br>Operational Stress Fist Aid.<br><br>STATEMENT OF WORK<br>For Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW)<br>Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) development <br><br>workshop FY-11<br>For the Arizona National Guard<br><br>1.0  INTRODUCTION<br><br>1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is <br><br>to provide contractor support to develop and deliver a <br><br>Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW) for Arizona <br><br>National Guard Service Members and their Families.  Further, <br><br>the Arizona National Guard requires contract support to hold a <br><br>symposium and planning meeting to develop a National Guard <br><br>Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) curriculum to <br><br>be delivered at one PDTW for the Arizona National Guard <br><br>Service Members and their Families.<br><br>1.2  Background.  Family Programs in conjunction with the <br><br>Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program are responsible for <br><br>sponsoring, developing and presenting the COSFA model for <br><br>Arizona National Guard Service Members and families.  The PDTW <br><br>will be an ongoing event conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, <br><br>beginning upon the approval of the contract and continuing <br><br>when services are requested. The purpose of the PDTW is to <br><br>prepare the above personnel personally and professionally to <br><br>facilitate and provide crisis care and awareness for Arizona <br><br>National Guard personnel and other authorized members of the <br><br>Department of the Army. The COSFA development workshop will <br><br>also ensure that Arizona National Guard Service Members are <br><br>prepared to effectively deliver inclusive operational stress <br><br>care and provide training to other Service Members to help <br><br>identify Service Members and their Families who are at risk. <br><br>The Arizona National Guard has identified the need and will <br><br>implement the developed model of Combat Stress First Aid <br><br>(COSFA) to be used in the aftermath of crisis events, which <br><br>differs from traditional models of immediate stress <br><br>intervention.  The COSFA implementation will create a <br><br>curriculum, which will be developed into a PDTW held in <br><br>Phoenix, Arizona, at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park <br><br>Military Reservation upon approval of the contract and for <br><br>future dates upon request. There will also be a second three-<br><br>day PDTW conducted in the future at a later date to be <br><br>determined. The curriculum shall entail the following <br><br>components: 1. Introduction to the framework of the COSFA <br><br>model, 2. Skills based training on how to use the stress first <br><br>aid model for individuals in crisis, 3. How to use the stress <br><br>first aid model to respond to units in distress, and 4. How to <br><br>guide commands on the use and utility of the COSFA model.<br><br>1.3  Scope.  The contractor shall develop and deliver a <br><br>Professional Development Training Course (PDTC). This project <br><br>will require development of a curriculum and relevant training <br><br>support materials, curriculum validation and curriculum <br><br>implementation. A select representative group determined by <br><br>the Arizona National Guard will validate the curriculum upon <br><br>approval of the contract, which will be held at the Arizona <br><br>National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix, <br><br>Arizona. <br><br>The contractor shall develop all logistical needs to create a <br><br>three-day conference to implement COSFA as a crisis <br><br>intervention into the Arizona National Guard.  The outcome of <br><br>this conference will be the development and validation of a <br><br>content and curriculum, as well as trained personnel within <br><br>the National Guard who will be able to inform and educate <br><br>other potential trainers and provide services to those Service <br><br>Members and families needing crisis intervention. This PDTW <br><br>will be delivered in Phoenix, Arizona.<br><br>1.4  Security Classification.  This SOW and the initial <br><br>training materials under procurement are unclassified.<br><br>2.0  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS<br><br>The following specifications shall apply to this project:<br><br>2.1  Military Standards.  <br><br>MIL-PRF 29612B, Performance Specification, Training Data <br><br>Products<br>MIL-HDBKs 29612B, Parts 1-5, Training Data Products<br><br>2.2  Technical References.  <br><br>International Association of Continuing Education and Training <br><br>(IACET.

The COSFA training will <br><br>address the purpose, function, limitations, applicability and <br><br>scope of advisement on the tactical, operational and strategic <br><br>levels.  It will also address the derivative tasks of <br><br>advisement to include participation in military operations and <br><br>in the development of moral and ethical maturity of Service <br><br>Members, families, and friends. <br><br>The development of the PDTW will provide training based upon <br><br>recognizing when someone, more specifically Service Members, <br><br>are in distress, breaking the code of silence that is present <br><br>with the Service Member, and engaging the Service Member to <br><br>connect to the next level of support needed.  The function of <br><br>this model is to properly inform Arizona National Guard <br><br>Service Members and their Families of the COSFA model, train <br><br>them in individual and unit intervention strategies and work <br><br>with and inform command of the functionality of the COSFA <br><br>model as an evidence based model of care for personnel and <br><br>units, which can act as a force multiplier.<br><br>Objectives:<br>     At the conclusion of the COSFA training, 20 newly <br><br>validated trainers will be able to:<br>     <br>           (1)  Understand the COSFA model and the intent <br><br>behind the "Be Resilient" Program.<br>           <br>           (2)  Describe the function, scope and limitations <br><br>of advisement in executing the command's mission, including <br><br>the management of issues related to the impact of military <br><br>operations and wartime missions.<br>           <br>           (3)  Identify the derivative tasks of advisement.  <br><br>This shall include tasks related to functioning as a command <br><br>liaison, key leader engagement protocols, and the education of <br><br>personnel in moral decision-making, cultural awareness, and <br><br>cross-cultural communications. <br><br>(4)  Discuss the methods in which the trainer delivers <br>advice to the chain of command.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50, March 16, 2011. The Government intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a single Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract with one (1) base year and two (2) option years. The subsequent contract will be awarded using FAR Part 13.5 procedures.<br /><br />This solicitation is for a non-personal health care services contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical, professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The contractor indemnifies the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Government requires the contractor to maintain medical liability insurance, in coverage amounts which are not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services, contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. The minimum of $3,000 shall be ordered on this contract and the maximum contract amount over the life of the contract, including all options if exercised, is $400,000. The minimum contract amount of $3,000 may be met by one or more orders during the base year of the contract.<br /><br />Primary place of performance is Togus VA Hospital, Augusta, ME, with periodic performance at various armory locations throughout the State of Maine. The capability of contractors to provide mobile-based medical services for any and all specialities in the contract is desired. Description of requirement: The Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) requires Periodic Health Assessments (PHA) to include: dental screening and treatment, immunization updating, physical exams, phlebotomy, vision screening, womens health screening and MEDPROS and DENCLASS systems updating of service members during a one (1) year base period beginning 27 April 2011, the anticipated award date, with two (2) option years exercised at the discretion of the Government. The government may inspect facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. (MEDPROS and DENCLASS are available through the Army Medical Operation Data System [MODS] at www.mods.army.mil.) Performance Standards: In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, the contractor shall provide, in a fixed or mobile setting, all management, labor, material, personal equipment, certifications and supplies necessary to provide Medical services, dental examinations, dental treatments, health and dental record updating, MEDPROS and DENCLASS updating. <br /><br />The first anticipated task order against the resulting ID/IQ contract is planned for 30 April 2011.<br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made based on an evaluation of the criteria of price, past performance and technical capability. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price; 2) Past Performance; 3) Technical Capability. A consideration when evaluating technical capability will be continuity of personnel offered by the contractor. Continuity of personnel will limit the need for constant training of new personnel month to month. Past Performance and Technical Capability, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements through past performance at similar events (assessing military members for medical fitness to standards in accordance with Army Regulation 40-501, chapter 3, 7 and 8), either as the prime or first tier subcontractor, and by identification of key personnel that have past performance experience. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br />Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): <br />Priced 0001, Physician Services<br />Priced 0002, Physician Assistant / Nurse Practioner Services<br />Priced 0003, Registered Nurse Services<br />Priced 0004, Phlebotomist Services<br />Priced 0005, Dentist Services<br />Priced 0006, Optometrist Services<br />Priced 0007, Mobile medical/dental exam facilities<br />Priced 0008, Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement (yearly requirement).

Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO.

(c)	If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE's completion of its verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued.
 
(d)	This deviation will expire December 31, 2011. Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.1102, COs shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified in VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov.

<p>4.2 Industry Documents.</p>
<p>4.2.1 - OEM Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM) and other applicable technical specifications for the components set forth in the Schedule.</p>
<p>4.2.2 - Industry documents are not available from the US Coast Guard and may be obtained from the applicable OEM .</p>
<p>4.3 - Order of Precedence. In the event of conflicts between OEM specifications and procedures and USCG specifications and procedures, the order of precedence is as follows:</p>
<p>4.3.1 - USCG specifications and procedures.</p>
<p>4.3.2 - DOD specification and procedures.</p>
<p>4.3.3 - OEM specifications and procedures.</p>
<p>5.0 - REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>5.1- Manufacture. All lighting panels are to be manufactured to meet, or exceed, Class 1-NVIS "A", Type V (five) panels to support night vision operations. Panels must also provide incandescent lighting supporting a 5 volt AC aircraft power source. Panels must also be manufactured as a two-piece item, with removable backs for bulb replacement and maintenance. All documentation certifying these panels as "air worthy" must be provided with the asset upon receipt and prior to receipt of any payments due.</p>
<p>5.1.2 - Repair. Components shall be repaired for the specific fault for which they were returned. A DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Repairable) Tag-material, or Department of Transportation, USCG, CG-1577-A (11-90), Unsatisfactory Report Tag will be attached to each non-RFI item describing faults. The contractor shall perform an inspection and correct deficiencies found. This shall include, but is not limited to, replacement of missing or broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion.</p>
<p>5.1.3 - Modifications. As mission requirements change, modifications to the lighting panels may be necessary. These modifications may require movement of identifiers for switches, circuit breakers, rheostats, etc., as directed by the Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Short Range Recovery (SRR) Engineering Section. Our Engineers will submit the required changes to the assigned Inventory Manager, who will submit a change request to the Contracting Officer who will submit a Request For Quote (RFQ) to incorporate these changes. The vendor will then submit a quote to the Contracting Officer for the total cost of these changes, including Turn-Around-Time (TAT) and Estimated Delivery Dates (EDD) for the receipt of the new items. The quote for the modification will then be technically reviewed and if acceptable will result in a contract modification provided the cost is considered "Fair and Reasonable".</p>
<p>5.1.4 - Part Number Changes. When modifications are requested by the SRR Engineering Section, a new part number must be assigned by the vendor for the panel being modified in order to maintain separation of older style verses new style. In the past, changes have been made to panels without significant changes to the part numbers leading to confusion and inventory inaccuracies. Once accepted and approved by both ALC and the Vendor, the Inventory Manager will submit the proper paperwork to assign a new National Stock Number (NSN), update the CGTO 1H-65-4, Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC), and any other applicable documents. These changes will then be submitted to Procurement for the modifications to be incorporated within the Schedule, updating the Contract Line Item (CLIN) affected and any price changes as agreed on an "as required" basis.</p>
<p>5.2 - Corrosion. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in a component shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part, or parts, affected.<br />5.2.1 - Corrosion Treatment. Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas will be accomplished IAW OEM specifications and FAA Advisory Circular AC 43-4A, dated 07/24/1991, Corrosion Control for Aircraft.</p>
<p>5.3 - Repair Procedures. The contractor shall make every effort to develop a repair procedure for component parts for which none exist. The contractor shall submit the procedure to the USCG for approval prior to implementation. The contractor may be required to coordinate changes with the OEM if applicable.</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUNE 2008) <br />Offerors are to submit their quotes as follows: <br /><br />Volume I- Technical Quote shall contain (1) copy of the company Quality Control Manual, Past Performance, &amp; Delivery time in days for the manufacture, spares, repairs and modifications for each panel. <br /><br />Volume II- Price Quote shall include the proposed pricing information IAW the attached Price Quote Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions apply:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision- <br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. <br />"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means- <br />(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and <br />(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). <br />(b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000. <br />(c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information: <br />(1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: <br />(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction. <br />(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. <br />(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in- <br />(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or <br />(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. <br />(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. <br />(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. <br />(d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). <br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (Alt IV) (OCT 1997).</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability- Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p>1. Quality Control:- The contractor shall provide verification that they possess Quality Control procedures and certifications applicable to the services being requested.</p>
<p>2. OEM Procedures:- The contractor shall provide verification that they have the capability to manufacture, repair and modify the panels, have the capability to produce all requested documentation and have the capability to provide technical support.<br /><br />USCG Evaluation of Technical Capability: Evaluation of vendor's technical capability shall include evaluation by the USCG New Product Development Branch. The evaluation will include in-depth analysis of the vendor's capability to complete the work being solicited to include: facilities, personnel, and associated processes (Quality Control, inventory management, etc.). This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit. Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be further considered for contract award.</p>
<p>This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for possible contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: Only offerors successfully meeting the technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: delivery, past performance (relevant and recent) and price.</p>
<p>Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.</p>
<p>Delivery: The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work. Delivery times in days for the manufacture, spares, repairs and modifications for each panel will be evaluated. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date for all items will be rated higher, with offerors that can meet or exceed the government's desired delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Price: The contractor shall provide pricing based on the manufacture of first articles, unit price of sparing, repair prices, test and evaluation prices, modification prices and labor rates for unusual damage, technical support, product improvement/engineering change proposal, service bulletins as requested in the attached quote sheet titled "HSCG38-10-Q-200169 Quote Sheet". Total price evaluation will be for the Base and all four Option periods. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG-2009), <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision- <br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. <br />"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means- <br />(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and <br />(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). <br />(b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000. <br />(c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information: <br />(1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: <br />(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction. <br />(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. <br />(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in- <br />(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or <br />(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. <br />(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. <br />(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. <br />(d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). <br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (Alt IV) (OCT 1997).</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost of pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information described below:<br />Provide pricing using the Excel Spreadsheet attached to the solicitation for the base and all four option periods. The government may request additional pricing information on recent sales for similar items and quantities and current catalog pricing, if available, to be used for a Fair and Reasonable Price comparison.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability- Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p>1. Quality Control:- The contractor shall provide verification that they possess Quality Control procedures and certifications applicable to the services being requested.</p>
<p>2. OEM Procedures:- The contractor shall provide verification that they have the capability to manufacture, repair and modify the panels, have the capability to produce all requested documentation and have the capability to provide technical support.<br /><br />USCG Evaluation of Technical Capability: Evaluation of vendor's technical capability shall include evaluation by the USCG New Product Development Branch. The evaluation will include in-depth analysis of the vendor's capability to complete the work being solicited to include: facilities, personnel, and associated processes (Quality Control, inventory management, etc.). This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit. Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be further considered for contract award.</p>
<p>This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for possible contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: Only offerors successfully meeting the technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: delivery, past performance (relevant and recent) and price.</p>
<p>Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.</p>
<p>Delivery: The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work. Delivery times in days for the manufacture, spares, repairs and modifications for each panel will be evaluated. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date for all items will be rated higher, with offerors that can meet or exceed the government's desired delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Price: The contractor shall provide pricing based on the manufacture of first articles, unit price of sparing, repair prices, test and evaluation prices, modification prices and labor rates for unusual damage, technical support, product improvement/engineering change proposal, service bulletins as requested in the attached quote sheet titled "HSCG38-10-Q-200169 Quote Sheet". Total price evaluation will be for the Base and all four Option periods. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG-2009), <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision. Alternate I (Apr 2002) adds paragraph (c) (11) to the basic provision.</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>Please note the following questions and answers:

Q.	Are there any pictures of the area available; also, any information or drawings of the sign, sizes, material, etc.?
A.	There are no drawings or information on the sign itself, other than observation.  It appears to be a metal housing with plastic face.  	The housing appears to be securely fastened to the building.  The plastic has deteriorated and is broken.  It is becoming a hazard 	during high wind conditions.

Q.	If this is the sign on the south side on the building bump out area over the garage, it looks like access to roof would have to be 	either  out  some windows on the top floor or from the upper roof, and down a temporary ladder. Is that correct?
A.	There is access to the roof of the 11th floor, then down to the roof of the 10th floor via a permanent ladder.

Q.	The temp electric would be for contractor's use on our equipment, is that correct?
A.	The temp electric is for the contractor's equipment

Q.	Is the sign de-energized and disconnected from panels or will we need to do it?
A.	The sign is de-energized

Q.	Can the rigging and or ferrying of equipment to roof or other areas be done at other times besides Sat or Sun, (maybe nights?) or 	other times if it can be unobtrusive to public; can we leave rigging/staging installed during week??
A.	The reason for the Saturday & Sunday work is to be able to block off the parking lot and smoking shelter, which is directly below 	the sign. All set-ups and/ or rigging can be done ahead of the actual dismantling of the sign.  Shuttling of equipment should be 	done during the evening or night hours.

Q.	Will we be disposing of sign?
A.	Vendor will be responsible for removing the sign in its entirety from VA Property

This is a service, not construction

<DESC>Amendment 0004 to RFP FA8629-11-R-2317 is a reply to a question submitted on 18 Apr 2011:
<p>Question: Reference the revised Performance Work Statement (PWS) dated 11 April 2011, Section J, Attachment 1, Sections 1.1 and 1.5.1:</p>
<p>PWS stipulates (Section 1.1) that all aerial refueling contacts will be "Dry" plugs, defined as "no fuel transferred." If this is the case, how is it expected that there will be "...fuel spray that typically occurs at disconnect..."? Is it intended that the hose will be "charged," i.e. filled with fuel? If so, what mechanism will be used to assure no fuel is transferred to the receiver aircraft?</p>
<p>ANSWER: <br />Fuel loading on the hose is sufficiently significant to catenary curve and hose response, so surrogate flight testing will be done with a charged refueling hose. If the receiver (aircraft) keeps their aerial refueling check valve CLOSED, there should be no fuel transfer.</p>

Include additional supporting documentation as applicable.<br>Summary<br>The Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care has an urgent need for a dried plasma product for use as transfusion product or resuscitation fluid to replace coagulation factors for non-compressible hemorrhage injuries, or for related indications. It is hypothesized that a dried plasma product could limit preventable fatalities by reducing logistical constraints associated with currently used frozen plasma products and expanding the availability of plasma in military operations. The purpose of this program is to support R&D efforts for the development of a spray dried plasma product for use as transfusion product or resuscitation fluid to replace coagulation factors for non-compressible hemorrhage injuries, or for related indications. Milestones may include IND submission, clinical trials, FDA approval, and various field testing efforts.<br>End User requirements<br>a. Ease of use: plasma product must provide maximum ease of use and be easily accessed, re-suspended and delivered.<br>b. Portability: Product packaging must be light, durable and able to handle harsh conditions. No glass bottles can be used to store product.<br>c. Sustainability: Shelf stable - can be safely stored in a sealed container at a room or ambient temperature for an extended period of time.<br><br>If you have any questions please contact Shawn Haubner at<br>shawn.haubner@us.army.mil, or call (508) 233-6167.<br>

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307." </span>

<DESC>Type of Notification:   Request for Proposal (RFP) for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
NOTE - THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  DOE will only accept proposals from small businesses that do not exceed the small business size standard of $25.5M in average annual receipts under NAICS code 484230 "Specialized Freight (except used goods) Trucking, Long-Distance."
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is procuring the continuation of carrier services for the award of a contract or contracts for the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) wastes and mixed hazardous constituents, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and asbestos between various DOE sites across the country and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico.   
The transport of TRU waste is accomplished by contract carriers that transport the waste via public highways on custom designed trailers in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved packages.  The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract using firm-fixed- price delivery task orders over a five-year contract period, consisting of a one year base ordering period and four additional one-year option ordering periods.  
This procurement will replace two existing carrier contracts that will expire March 2012 and September 2012, respectively.  Two contracts are anticipated to be awarded by March 2012. The carriers are responsible for transitioning the work from the current carrier contractors without interruption, and maintaining the WIPP disposal schedule.
Contractor proposals are requested by May 17, 2011.  THE RFP CAN BE FOUND AT: www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php
Interested parties are encouraged to view the website at www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php regularly for information about this procurement as it will be the primary conduit with which to provide such information.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6079, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><strong><br />Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Milan, Department of Epidemiology, EPOCA center for Epidemiology Research, Via San Barnaba, 8, 20122 Milan, Italy for the collection of data on treatment, toxicity, disease progression and survival for all lung cancer cases enrolled in The Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) population-based study and the restaging of all lung cancer diagnoses based on the new 2010 AJCC classification.
<p><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7 Million.</p>
<p><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p><br />The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p><br />NCI designed and conducted The Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) population-based study, between April 2002 and February 2005, precisely to study the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer risk and progression with the aim of improving preventive and treatment strategies for lung cancer. Since approximately 5 years have passed since the study was initiated, NCI needs to collect information on disease progression from every lung cancer case enrolled in EAGLE. Specific details on treatment, toxicity after treatment as well as disease progression, and survival are needed to identify the genetic determinants and other factors that could impact survival and treatment efficacy. Moreover, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer has recently issued a Revised International System for Staging Lung Cancer, based on information from a clinical database of more than 5,000 patients.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to (1) support the collection of data on treatment, toxicity, disease progression and survival for all lung cancer cases enrolled in EAGLE and (2) the restaging of all lung cancer diagnoses based on the new 2010 AJCC classification.</p>
<p><br />The University of Milan, Italy EPOCA Center for Epidemiology Research with Dr. Angela Pesatori is uniquely qualified to conduct these activities. The EAGLE study coordination and management including enrollment of all study subjects, epidemiological data, clinical data and biospecimen collection was done at the University of Milan; they also developed the database construction for all EAGLE data. The University of Milan and EPOCA Center have been involved in cancer studies for decades; they have knowledge of the hospitals, contact information, as well as intimate knowledge of treatment and pathology documentation necessary for this project. The University of Milan is the only known source.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) a follow-on contract to its current contract with the Public Health Institute, 555 12th Street, 10th Floor, Oakland, CA &nbsp;94607.<br /><br />This new follow-on contract will provide for the following: (1) updating and maintenance of name and address data files of 50,000 individuals involved in the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS). Specifically, the Public Health Institute will continue 1) maintaining and updating on an annual basis the name and address files of the Child Health and Development Studies, 2) facilitating future biomedical and psychosocial studies of this important clinical resource which includes a large serum collection; and 3) providing a mechanism to maintain patient confidentiality, by acting as a neutral intermediary linking outside investigators and the subjects of the CHDS and their serum samples. The Contractor will keep the names and addresses of the CHDS subjects confidential and will make the necessary linkages between the subjects' names and addresses and their respective identification numbers on the CHDS interactive central computer file and their serum sample accession numbers for the 285,000-vial serum collection. A critical function of the potential source will be to contact CHDS subjects to ascertain if they wish to participate in biomedical and/or psychosocial studies proposed by outside investigators and to arrange for subject interviews and the necessary testing, imaging, and biological sampling.<br /><br />Public Health Institute will also maintain up-to-date confidential data linkages with the Automatch program of the California Department of Health Services, [also known as the California Mortality Linkage Service], the California Tumor Registry, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles in order to keep track of the vital statistics and current addresses of the 50,000 subjects of the CHDS of their offspring. <br /><br />There is no other source presently known to NICHD that posses the unique capabilities to maintain these data files. The current principal investigator and her associates participated in developing the extensive CHDS data files that are currently being maintained, augmented, and linked to other registries. In addition, there are no other investigators who have developed and codified the current extensive data collection and serum collection. Without an impossibly long time commitment and a prohibitive amount of Government funds, no other personnel could be trained to comprehend the enormous CHDS database with its 27 sub-files in addition to understanding the complexities of the associated serum collection and its research capabilities. The current Contractor has been involved for 40 years in developing data linkages and updating and maintaining the current address files as well as contacting subjects in the CHDS for participation in other research studies.<br /><br />If any Contractor believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit, within 15 days of publication of this notice, three (3) copies of a capability statement, limited to 15 pages excluding resumes, which will be considered by this agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: -9pt; mso-pagination: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">TEWD is tasked with developing simulations of naval EW systems, anti-ship threats, and military communication systems to support the development, fielding and testing of electronic and weapons systems. Computer simulations are highly valuable tools to research and enhance military testing and evaluation. Computer simulations facilitate relatively inexpensive and rapid force structure analysis, mission planning, test and evaluation and training. Distributed simulation - networking multiple, separate simulation components together - has become a key technology in maximizing the advantages of computer simulations, making possible the interface and interaction of a wide range of simulation components. Standardized protocols, such as Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), and technical advances, such as High Level Architecture (HLA), are the keys to the application of distributed simulations. Contractor support sought in this statement of work will concentrate on theoretical research, system research and development (R&amp;D), computer modeling and simulation, and test and evaluation (T&amp;E) relating to the interactions of platforms, weapons, sensors and EW systems. The selected contractor shall also develop and support HLA, DIS and the federation of multiple simulators to provide complex, high fidelity simulations on local computer networks as well as wide area networks (WAN). The unique nature of this research requires access to NRL hardware and classified computing resources and databases dictating that a major portion of the labor tasks be performed on-site at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor shall provide, on a level-of-effort basis, the man-hours of scientific, technical, and engineering support stated in the personnel qualification. <br /><br />The&nbsp;requirement is for a base year and four one year options. &nbsp;<br /></span></p>

<DESC><p><strong>U.S. Department of Labor<br />Small Business Vendor Outreach Sessions</strong></p>
<p>Interested in Introducing Your Company to the U.S Department of Labor?</p>
<p>To increase the U.S. Department of Labor's utilization of all types of small businesses, the Department's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) sponsors Small Business Vendor Outreach Sessions (VOS). These sessions offer small businesses the opportunity to market their capabilities directly to OSDBU and agency program officials and learn about potential Department procurement opportunities. Conversely, Department procurement officials can learn more about the diverse small business resources available to meet their procurement needs.</p>
<p>Department of Labor agencies buy a wide variety of goods and services valued at approximately $2.2 billion each year. Each DOL agency has a responsibility for procuring its own goods and services in support of the agency's mission. <br /><strong><br />General Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Vendor Outreach Sessions are held in the Department of Labor Great Hall on the second Wednesday of the designated month (unless otherwise noted) from 9:00 a.m. until 12 noon. Online registration will be available 30 days prior to each session. The address is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">U.S. Department of Labor <br />Frances Perkins Building (Great Hall)<br />200 Constitution Avenue, NW (between 2nd and 3rd Streets, NW) <br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sesssions begin at 9:00 a.m. and the end at 11:45 a.m. Follow-up meetings with agency representatives may be scheduled for a later date, if mutually agreed upon.</p>
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/vendor_internet_info.htm#content"></a>
<p><strong>How Do I Register?</strong></p>
<p>The next Vendor Outreach Session is scheduled for Wednesday, May 18, 2011. Vendors may sign up by <a href="http://webapps.dol.gov/osbp/sbis/log_in.asp">registering online</a> at <a href="http://www.dol.gov">www.dol.gov</a> beginning on April 18, 2011. Registration for this session ends at 12 noon, Friday, May 13, 2011. <strong>Upcoming Vendor Outreach Sessions.&nbsp; If you have questions please call 202-693-7299</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May 18, 2011 </li>

<p><strong>Making the Most of Your Visit</strong></p>
<p>Before you register for a Vendor Outreach Session, please visit other sites on the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/regs/procurement.htm">Small Business Procurement Power Page</a> to learn about the mission of each DOL agency and what each agency buys. The Procurement Power Page includes: What the Department of Labor Buys, a booklet which describes different agency functions; Department of Labor <a href="http://www.apps.dol.gov/contract_grant/report_inter.asp">Annual Acquisition Plan and Procurement Forecast</a>; <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/grants2.htm">Department of Labor Grants</a> and Various Department <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/grants/contract.htm">Contracting Information</a>.</p>
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/vendor_internet_info.htm#content"></a><strong>Getting to the Frances Perkins Building</strong>
<p><strong>Parking near the Department of Labor Frances Perkins Building is very limited.</strong> We strongly encourage use of the Metro. The Metro Judiciary Square Red Line is accessible at 4th and D Streets, NW (a diagonal walk from the Frances Perkins Building entrance at 3rd &amp; C Streets, NW).</p>
<p><strong>Entrance &amp; Check-in Information</strong></p>
<p>Enter the Department at the 3rd &amp; C Streets, NW entrance, obtain visitor's clearance, check in at the VOS registration table located in the 3rd &amp; C Streets lobby to confirm your arrival, then proceed to the Great Hall on the First Floor.</p>
<p>If you enter the building at any other entrance, you must still check in at the VOS registration table in the 3rd &amp; C Streets lobby.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you soon.</p>

The reconstruction will extend from Station 133+00 to Station 155+00. The intent of the embankment excavation is to remove the high plasticity clay that is prone to desiccation cracking and replacement of the existing drainage system with a horizontal blanket, chimney drain, and drain pipe at the levee toe to establish positive site drainage to a RD900 pump station. This improvement is intended to address the primary failure mechanisms by reducing the amount of desiccation cracking and saturation of the landside levee slope. The addition of the drain pipe and surrounding drain rock fill at the levee toe is intended to reduce the uplift gradient to acceptable levels. Because, the recommended embankment excavation will extend into the levee crest the crest roadway shall not be used during construction.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued on or about April 7, 2011, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

A1:  The anticipated class of the USMC Pack system is Class 1 - Coyote Brown 498.

Q2:  "The NAICS code is 315299, All Other Cut and Sew Apparel Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500 employees."  Does this mean that offerors must have less than 500 employees?
A2:  The size standard information was added as an oversight.  The procurement is unrestricted - not reserved as a set-aside.

Q3:  I was doing a quick review of the pre solicitation notice for the USMC pack and if Im reading it correctly it will also include a Chest Rig, Multiple Pouches, hydration Bladders and a Water Filter System?? Is that correct?
A3:  With respect to your question, the following is provided:

"Per the Draft Purchase Description Family of Load Bearing Equipment dated 8 April 2011, section 1.3, The USMC Pack will contain the following components:

Q4:  Is there any way go get the drawings prior to the release of the RFP?
A4:  Drawings will not be available until RFP release.

Q5:  Is there/ are there any packs you are looking at that could possibly be modeled after the current solicited pack?  
A5:  No, the USMC Pack will be government owned design.  

Q6:  I understand the current pre solicitation is for the pack only. Are the other parts of the Load bearing Equipment family going to be available for solicitation in the future?

<DESC>This is a contract modification to Contract N00033-06-D-6504. This requirements contract was awarded under full and open competition in February 2006 to Systems Research and Applications Corporation (SRA) for Information Technology (IT) Afloat Support Services. The current total contract maximum limit is $130,961,913.76. This justification seeks to increase this total maximum limit amount by $17,980,076.90 to $148,941,990.66.
<p>The services required by this modification are for the MSC Command, Control, Communications and Computer Systems (C4S) directorate (N6). The increase in the level of support required is necessitated by heavier usage of the following activities which are currently provided under the contract in order to ensure IT Information Assurance (IA), security, and compliance. This justification seeks to increase the contract total maximum limit by $17,980,076.90 for the increased requirements.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) which makes an exception for using other than competitive procedures on the basis that "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." This exception is implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
