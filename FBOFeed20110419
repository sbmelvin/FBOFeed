<DESC>Requirement:  Removal of Lead-Based Paint from Structures and Lead-Contaminated Soil at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, Midway Island.  Midway Atoll, located at the northwest end of the Hawaiian Islands archipelago comprises two main islands, Sand and Eastern, and one smaller islet, enclosed within a reef approximately 8 km (5 miles) in circumference, averaging 3 meters (10 feet) above average ocean levels.  Sand Island, the focus of this project is about 3 km (1.8 miles) by 2 km (1.2 miles) across with a total land area of about 4.45 square kilometers (1,100 acres).
Requirement is set-aside for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses within the western states of Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington.  Small Business Size Standards:  Applicable NAICS Code is 562910.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 14 million annually.  
Work has been divided into nine different decision units and is delineated in the Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) which was completed in January of 2011.  Work to be funded on the initial contract award and performed in FY2011 will consist of providing equipment, materials, and supplies for the preparation of the R2 disposal unit and implementing the removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 6.  Government IGE for this work to be performed is $1,205,798 + 143,800 (shared equipment costs) = $1,349,958.  Work for decision unit 6 is anticipated to be performed when Laysan albatross are not on island (August through October 2011). 
There are 6 option years associated with the Midway Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) removal actions; they are as follows:
Option year 1 (2012):  Equipment, materials, and supplies for removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 1 and the implementation of removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 1. IGE:  $579,031 + 143,800 (shared equipment costs) = $722,831
Option year 2 (2013):  Equipment, materials, and supplies for removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 2 and the implementation of removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 2. IGE:  $769,709 + 143,800 (shared equipment costs) = $912,879
Option year 3 (2014):  Equipment, materials, and supplies for removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 4 and the implementation of removal action alternative #3 in Decision Unit 4. IGE:  $677,074 + 143,800 (shared equipment costs) = $820,874
Option year 4 (2015):  Equipment, materials, and supplies for removal action alternative #3 in Decision Units 5 and 7 and the implementation of removal action alternative #3 in Decision Units 5 and 7. IGE:  $849,448 + 143,800 (shared equipment costs) = $993,248
Option year 5 (2016): Equipment, materials, and supplies for removal action alternative #3 in Decision Units 3 and 8 and the implementation of removal action alternative #3 in Decision Units 3 and 8. IGE:  $899,458 + 143,800 (shared equipment costs) = $1,043,258

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of NIST, Gaithersburg, MD and NIST, Charleston, SC, intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Linde, LLC of Murray Hill, NJ, for a 120 day purchase order to supply liquid nitrogen to NIST in Gaithersburg, MD and Charleston, SC, under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source.
<p>Liquid nitrogen service is an essential component for the equipment within the NIST laboratories to function and for scientists to conduct experiments. The supply of liquid nitrogen has been identified as an essential requirement. Service must continue without interruption to avoid damage and protect Government property, equipment, data, and samples as well as to avoid work stoppages in the laboratories.</p>
<p>A solicitation for a follow-on, five year liquid nitrogen contract, was released on www.fbo.gov on April 1, 2011. Proposals are currently due on May 1, 2011. It is necessary to maintain service until the new contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Linde is the incumbent contractor for the current liquid nitrogen requirement. Linde owns two of the ten tanks currently serviced under the existing contract as well as all of the six telemetry units currently in use. Linde has the unique capability to continue service to the Government without duplication of costs associated with installation of rented tanks and telemetry units required for continued use under this short term purchase order.</p>
<p>Given the need for continuation of service, award of a purchase order to other than Linde may require a break in service while rented tanks and telemetry units are replaced for this short term purchase order.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche for the Longitudinal Studies for Aging-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort (SardiNIA3) requirement.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their<br />interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen<br />days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the<br />discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of<br />determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be five years (12 months per year).</p>
<p>The Longitudinal Studies for Aging-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort (SardiNIA3) is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche has continued to support the Longitudinal Studies for Aging-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort activities related to data collection, data entry, verification, editing, transmittal and file management,and participation in the preparation of publications and public presentations of the results to qualified investigators. Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche has maintained access to over 6,000 participants enrolled in the SardiNIA study and has available precise testing equipment required for collecting core assessments of traits and genotyping; competency and experience with the data collection manuals, forms and procedures, data entry, management, verification and quality control, transfer, and tracking systems; and study-wide policies and procedures relevant to data usage and scientific productivity of the study. Further, all critical study components were developed, implemented, field-tested, and refined by the proposed Contractor in collaboration with the NIA over the course of the SardiNIA study. No other contractors could provide a comparable service in a timely and cost-efficient manner. In addition, successful follow-up of cohort participants required continued and regular contact established and maintained by the proposed contractor. The Contractor is also the sole proprietor of the specific version of the inventory management system developed for and used by the Longitudinal Studies for Aging-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort; therefore, there is limited access to the data management system itself. The Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche thus has the unique capability to provide the required services to NIA for the Longitudinal Studies for Aging-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort.</p>
<p>The SardiNIA3 requirement (1) must be performed in Sardinia, Italy; (2) has limited data access due to Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche being the sole proprietor of the specific version of the data management system; and (3) must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act or the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards pertaining to 36 CFR 1194.21.</p>
<p>The transfer of the data management system to another contractor (other than incumbent) would be disruptive to the project, requiring start up time to become familiar with over ten years of invaluable and irreplaceable data or cause unacceptable delays to the SardiNIA3 project; and would require duplication of cost to purchase and develop a new data management system. In summary, inherent risk of loss of over ten years of data collection, duplication of cost to the Government, and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study.</p>
<p>Background and Purpose of the Longitudinal Studies for Aging-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort:</p>
<p>In keeping with its overall mission, it is incumbent on the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to discriminate epidemiological and genetic factors involved in the etiology of aging-associated deficits, in order to understand and intervene to prevent or alleviate them. An indispensable and major step forward has been the progressive development of phenotypic tests for conditions and their application to determining statistical ranges of phenotypes in "outbred" (that is, genetically relatively heterogeneous populations with considerable admixtures from outside populations added over time), to assess both comparable statistical factors and epidemiological and genetic factors in the especially favorable Sardinian population.</p>
<p>During the ongoing 10-year contract, the incumbent contractor recruited over 6,100 subjects from a selected group of four towns in east-central Sardinia, and measured the traits for each subject. Genotyping of all participants was also completed that has provided the data for investigators to look for genetic factors associated with each trait. The infrastructure for the clinic and phenotypic testing has been stable, with stringent quality control, and the data are of correspondingly high quality.</p>
<p>The SardiNIA3 envisages a study for additional years. A critical step in longitudinal studies would record data from a fourth visit of participants (AIM I); and transfer of the data (AIM II) would provide them for later use in a range of studies, A subsidiary Aim III would be to design the studies to maintain an expansion to study additional phenotypes. The study is designed to permit the estimation of individual trajectories of quantitative traits, which requires the measure of at least three points in time to avoid the bias resulting from "regression to the mean". Thus, because some of the most important age-related traits were measured starting only in the second follow-up visit, completing four visits is essential to maximize the scientific productivity of the data collected in the SardiNIA study. A further advantage is that, by collecting multiple measurements over time, one can improve the power of mapping studies. Specifically, by modeling the repeated measures of each trait, one can focus on the long-term component of the trait for each individual.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-10-133 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-10-133.</p>
<p>The estimated contract award date will be on or about June 15, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), has a requirement for commercial supply vessel charter off the coast of California in the Southern California Bight for Highly Migratory Species in that area.
<p>NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) is planning a research survey in the Southern California Bight (SCB) for highly migratory species including pelagic sharks, swordfish, and albacore during the summer of 2011. The overall goals of the survey are: 1) to conduct a fishery-independent longline survey for juvenile mako and blue sharks continuing a 15 year abundance time series; 2) to conduct longline fishing for swordfish to deploy archival tags and collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of swordfish entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; 3) to conduct trolling for albacore for the deployment of archival tags and to collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of North Pacific albacore entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; and 4) to collect oceanographic data to examine environmental effects on the distribution and catch rates of sharks, swordfish, and albacore. The survey is being conducted to support research and data needs identified by NMFS and affiliated scientific organizations and committees including the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), the International Scientific Committee for Tunas and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC), and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). Conducting swordfish and albacore sampling will also help address some of the objectives of the Swordfish Leatherback Use of Temperate Habitat (SLUTH) Initiative and the SWFSC/Albacore Industry Cooperative Research program and provide a better examination of the large pelagic fish component of the SCB ecosystem.</p>
<p>Longline survey for juvenile mako and blue sharks:<br />The SCB is a nursery ground for neonate and juvenile shortfin mako and blue sharks. From 1988 through 1991, there was an experimental pelagic longline fishery for these sharks, but due to concern over the high catch of juveniles and the lack of a market for blue sharks, the fishery was discontinued. This abundance survey was initiated to monitor trends in catch rates of juvenile mako and blue sharks. Seven California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) defined fishing blocks (each 10 x 10 minutes; see Figure 1) were selected as survey locations based on their consistently high catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and low variability during the months of June through August for the experimental fishery. Gear used for the survey is the same as was used to target sharks during the fishery. During the past 17 years (1994 through 2010 with the exception of 1998 and 1999) fifteen surveys have been conducted within the focal areas. The data are to be used in support of stock assessments for mako and blue sharks, the two species caught in the greatest numbers during the survey. The survey also provides the opportunity to conduct tagging and studies of age and growth, reproductive status, and other aspects of the life history of these vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Swordfish longlining: <br />Commercial swordfish fisheries are the second most important fisheries for HMS off the U.S. West Coast. Swordfish longlining during the HMS research cruise will be conducted to: 1) collect additional information on swordfish essential habitat; and 2) examine stock structure off California. To achieve both objectives swordfish will be targeted at night in areas identified by sea surface temperature (SST) and frontal features in the SCB. Archival tags, which typically provide longer data records than can be obtained using pop-up satellite tags that are limited to ~9 months or less, will be deployed to examine swordfish fine-scale movements. Concurrent oceanographic measurements will be made to characterize swordfish habitat. The additional information on swordfish essential habitat will improve efforts to differentiate swordfish and leatherback turtle habitat. Long term records from archival tags will also provide information on swordfish stock structure. The area of the U.S. West Coast is thought to be one of mixing between fish originating from Hawaii and Mexico. Observations on parasite loads, skin morphology, and the presence of cookie cutter shark bites from all live individuals will help address this question. In addition, samples from swordfish that do not survive capture will be used to examine feeding habits, maturity, age and growth, and their physiological low oxygen threshold, which will provide insight into potential limits to vertical movements due to hypoxia.</p>
<p>Albacore trolling:<br />The U.S. North Pacific albacore surface fishery is one of the few remaining open access fisheries for HMS on the west coast. The North Pacific-wide stock is managed by the PFMC, IATTC, and Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). The last stock assessment conducted by the ISC concluded that current fishing effort may be above long term sustainable levels. The PFMC is considering potential regulatory measures, but there remain uncertainties about the age and growth model and albacore stock structure assumptions used in the assessment that may affect biomass and fishing mortality estimates. The SWFSC has been actively studying albacore in cooperation with both the west coast recreational and commercial fleets; however, access to whole fish for tagging and biological sampling early in the season when fish return to the SCB is limited and has been identified as a priority. Based on logs of the commercial passenger fishing fleet in southern California from 1981 through 2007, areas with high catch rates in June and July have been identified for targeting albacore (see Figure 2). Albacore will be targeted using several different fishing methods including rod and reel, handline, and troll, supplemented by chumming with live bait. Subsamples of fish will be provided for use by other scientists of the ISC Albacore Working Group (ALBWG) as identified under the ALBWG research priorities as well as within the SWFSC for age and growth, feeding habits, otolith microchemistry, and genetics studies.</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and services necessary to provide a vessel charter in the Southern California Bight as noted in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The resulting firm-fixed-price (with reimbursement of fuel at cost) contract will have a base period of performance from approximately June 15, 2011 through June 14, 2012, with one (1) option period, consecutively occurring after the base period.<br /><br />The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>G11PS00299
<RESPDATE>042711
<ARCHDATE>05272011
<CONTACT>Grace Oakeley
<DESC>This is a SOLICITATION NOT a pre-solicitation:Please go to Fedconnect for full details.
The Minerals Team of the U.S. Geological Survey needs high-quality Re-Os isotopic analyses of whole rocks and mineral separates from one of the largest gold deposits in the world.  The Homestake mine, South Dakota, has been the site of extensive geologic, geochemical, isotopic, and mineralogic studies by the author and others in the Denver office.  As with many ore deposits, defining the timing of mineralization is difficult because sulfide minerals do not yield reliable radiogenic ages by conventional isotopic analyses.  The Re-Os system, however, is capable of determining both the depositional age of carbon-rich sedimentary rocks and the mineralizing age of arsenopyrite, electrum, and some gangue minerals.  As part of the World-class deposit-model program of the USGS, we need to contract with an outside analytical laboratory having a proven track record of investigations on mineral deposits, to provide Re-Os isotopic data and interpretations of the gold deposit at the Homestake mine.
Few laboratories are capable of providing high-quality Re-Os analyses at competitive prices due to the small number of existing laboratories and the complicated nature of the analyses. In the United States there are about three such facilities; in Canada are an additional two.  For our analyses, Re and Os concentrations and isotopic compositions are needed for each sample.  Below we outline the specifications of work needed for material from the Homestake mine for FY 2011.
See the attached document for full statement of work.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a brand name sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)), Simplified Acquisition Procedures for One (1) New Volvo Penta D6-330A PS 12v marine engine AND One (1) New Volvo Penta DP-H 1.76:1 Stern Drive.USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Geology operates a fleet of large and small vessels to conduct geophysical and marine mapping and oceanographic research. Our flagship research and seafloor mapping vessel, the Parke Snavely, is powered by two Volvo Penta 06-33A PS 12v Marine Engines with Volvo Penta OP-H 1.76:1 stern drives. We also have a third, spare Volvo Penta OP-H 1 :76 stern drive that we keep serviced and on hand for replacement of the operational drives when is damaged during field survey operations. 
We have acquired a second large vessel, a 26' Radon workboat, from USGS BRO that will increase our mapping and survey capability. This vessel was acquired without a working engine and we intend to power it with a single engine and stern drive identical to those in the Parke Snavely. This would allow us to use existing special maintenance tools, expendables and replacement parts to service both vessels, thus providing efficiency and cost savings for our vessel maintenance and support program. The Volvo Penta DP-H 1.76:1 stern drive is designed to operate with the Volvo Penta 0633A PS 12v Marine Engine as a matched set. When installed as a matched system, the engine and stern drive are warranted by the manufacturer.

The Volcano also has the OCT (optical coherence tomography) capability and accommodates different catheters, including peripheral catheters, AAA IVUS catheters and FFR wires. Boston Scientifics' IVUS system does not have an FFR and the St. Jude IVUS system does not have an FFR.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  A search of GSA, SBA and Vetbizops did not reveal another system with the characteristics that Madison has requested. GSA had 1 similar but did not have what Madison needed. A GSA Waiver was pursued and granted by NAC. A FedBizOpps publication will announce the intent to sole source this requirement.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Overall pricing will be compared to contractor's list prices. I have purchased this once previously at the noted price. The quote Madison received was about eighteen thousand higher but has more options than previous purchase. $155,000 was the quoted price to Madison.

8.	Market survey conducted:  Madison has indicated that this is a sole source requirement/need that is critical to their department and vital to direct patient care, throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs Agency. The Contracting Officer researched GSA, FBO, SBA and Vetbiz to verify this is a Sole Source. Madison did a direct comparison of the other 2 vendors that sell a compatible product and stated that Boston Scientific and St. Jude do not have the features or capabilities that they require.
Boston Scientific and St. Jude do not provide FFR (fractional flow reserve).
 
9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  A FEDBIZOPPS ad may generate alternate sources.


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Volcano Corporation's s5I Imaging System, Madison VA


11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The Contracting Officer searched the Dynamic Small Business Search feature of CCR and VetBiz Registry but did not reveal comparable products. There were multiple sole source awards for the exact same item on FBO in the archives.   

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Any equipment left overnight is the sole responsibility of the vendor and shall be secured. Vendor must remove any and all equipment within 24-hours of notification from 96 FSS to ensure safety and security of forces. Vendor must be insured and must maintain current vehicle registration on concessionary trailer.</p>
<p>b. Food shall be served at the proper temperature to meet health and safety guidelines established by Eglin Public Health. A properly calibrated thermometer shall be used to monitor food storage, cooking and serving temperatures.</p>
<p>c. Food sold shall be in carry out containers.</p>
<p>d. Concessionaire contractor shall be licensed locally and meet all federal, state and local business requirements in accordance with Concessionaire contract Article II, paragraphs 3 and 10.</p>
<p>e. Concessionaire contractor shall be responsible for daily trash pick up and cleaning in and around pavilions and cleaning around the general area where they will be operating.</p>
<p>f. Concessionaire contractor shall be open for service seven (7) days a week 11:00 a.m to 5:00 p.m from 01 May through 01 November. However if business volume cannot support the requested hours, the vendor will contact the Outdoor Recreation Marina Complex Manager or Outdoor Recreation Director and provide change of hours. Upon notification and approval of the 96th FSS, vendor may close services for the periods approved. The vendor may choose to be open additional hours as business warrants.</p>
<p>g . Concessionaire contractor is required to submit initial menu and pricing to 96th Force Support Squadron for approval. Deviations must be authorized by 96th Force Support Squadron prior to implementation.</p>

<p>b. Provide appropriate utilities: three 120 volts plugs running thru 30 Amp circuit breaker, above ground faucet, no water runoff.

The concessionaire shall instruct his employees in utilities conservation practices and shall be responsible for operation under conditions which preclude the waste of government utilities/resources.</p>
<p>c. The Outdoor Recreation Director shall conduct regularly scheduled visits to the site.</p>

Prior to vendor operation, Eglin Safety Office and Eglin Public Health Office will inspect equipment and processes. This initial check will be conducted prior to the start of the contract. Additionally, periodic inspections will be made by the Safety Office and the Public Health Office.</p>

<SUBJECT>9 FAM-e Visas
<SOLNBR>REF9FAM
<RESPDATE>052511
<CONTACT>JoAnn Stewart, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038756646, Fax 7038756085, Email stewartj@state.gov - Reaver T. Clements, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038755077, Fax 7038756085, Email clementsrl@state.gov
<DESC>Purpose: The Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Visa Office of Legislation and Regulations and the Office of Consular Systems and Technology Services, is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only. This does not constitute an Invitation for Bids nor a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI, or any subsequent RFP. The purpose of this Request for Information is to receive feedback and Capability Statements from the Small Business community and is in support of market research. <br />
<p>Background: Despite recent revisions to the organization and content of the visa volume of the Foreign Affairs Manual, the basic format and content parallel the Immigration and Nationality Act, As Amended, and Volume 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations. With current technological capabilities, much of the earlier rationale for the complex and unusual format is no longer valid. This long-standing format originally was required to ensure that field officers were easily able to cite relevant areas of law and regulation when seeking legal and other opinions of the Department, and in dealing with Members of Congress and the public, including with attorneys representing clients. The Bureau of Consular Affairs now seeks to develop a simpler, more interactive, and searchable 9 FAM (Visas). This is a complicated undertaking that will involve working with the new enterprise search engine being installed as part of the SMART messaging project or another enterprise search engine.</p>
<p>The Department's primary search engine, Autonomy, is producing somewhat better search results on 9 FAM than its predecessor did, but it still has difficulty searching through the 4000 pages of 9 FAM visa material. Even a new and more sophisticated search engine will have similar problems without an adequate taxonomy and more simplified text structure for this large volume. Reorganization and simplification of the format and drafting will provide Department users, at home and abroad, improved ability to retrieve unstructured and structured data through the OpenNet unclassified and classified Intranet home pages. Restructuring 9 FAM should permit process-related views of material and make searches easier. Since 2003, the Department has relied on 9 FAM for definitive legal, policy, and procedural guidance.</p>
<p>Scope: The Department requires the new 9 FAM be a world-class, electronic 9 FAM-e, or content portal. This new portal will allow a user-friendly interface with enhanced search functionality to query both structured and unstructured content by keywords or similar means. This new portal will also allow easy data aggregation, which should be able to pull links and content together into a single place that helps users know where to go if they are looking for information. It is also envisioned that the new 9 FAM-e will allow more robust self-service capabilities, such as the ability to save previous searches (My Favorites), and allow for more robust user-interaction and a customizable experience.</p>
<p>This 9 FAM-e project is intended to provide, the full range of search and knowledge management services required to meet State's responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders including the newly implemented Plain Writing Act of 2010, Public Law 111-274.</p>
<p>Vendor Submission Instructions: Small Business Vendors who believe that they possess the expertise and experience to fulfill all of the requirements listed in the SOO are invited to please:</p>
<p>1. Submit technical and management capabilities; and experiences, addressing each of these areas in writing. Include: company name; address; e-mail address, telephone number; points of contact; and size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS).</p>
<p>2. Include a description of the solutions that may deliver end user functionality, or support the development, deployment, and maintenance of the 9 FAM-e as a system. As part of your discussion, please address the following: (a) Solution description and key features (b) Performance characteristics (c) Any architectural considerations (d) The degree of customization or configuration anticipated to meet the Government's requirements (e) Cost drivers.<br /><br />3. Discuss any implementation considerations you believe are relevant to the 9 FAM-e initiative as a whole. This discussion may include salient risks and mitigation measures, lessons learned from other projects or agencies, contracting approaches, or any other pertinent information.<br /><br />4. Describe your firm's capabilities as related to the scope of 9 FAM-e. Vendors are asked to provide relevant examples of previous work or solution implementations, to include client POCs. Federal and state government projects will be considered more relevant than commercial examples.<br /><br />5. Provide cost or price estimates for the delivery of a complete solution that meets all requirements listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Also please provide possible labor category information for fulfilling the requirements listed in the SOO.<br /><br />Your capabilities package must be company-specific. Capability packages that include teaming partners, subcontractors, etc. are not solicited and will not be reviewed.<br /><br />To the maximum extent possible, submit Non-Proprietary Information. All information received in this RFI that is appropriately marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed.</p>
<p>No phone calls related to this RFI will be accepted. All correspondence must be made via email. All responses need to be provided in electronic format (.PDF preferred). Font should be Times New Roman, size 12. Responses should not exceed 20 pages. All packages submitted by email must be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement will be requested, which must be provided within three days after notification. Please submit responses no later than 11:00 a.m EDT, May 18, 2011, to stewartj@state.gov. Cut-off for questions and answers is, May 4, 2011; 12 noon EDT. NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.<br />After review of vendor's questions, the following reply is issued: Thank you for your questions related to the 9 FAM-e Request for Information (RFI). At this time, 9 FAM-e is at the conceptual level and the most accurate depiction of the 9 FAM-e is contained in the SOO. This RFI is not tied to an acquisition and the responses will be used for informational purposes. We are therefore interested in any proposed solutions that your respective firms bring to the marketing research effort. We will provide additional details that will address your specific questions as we move forward to the acquisition phase.</p>

Performance Work Statement (PWS)

Department of Veterans Affairs

Electronic Contract Management System (eCMS) Support Services 

February 2011



1.0	Introduction.

1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of this project is to acquire services to support the users of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Electronic Contract Management System.  

1.2  Background.  The Electronic Contract Management System (eCMS) processes on a series of servers located at the Austin Information Technology Center.  End user support is addressed in concert with contracting office eCMS Application Coordinators (ACs) located thoughout the country.
 

2.0  Scope of Work.  This procurement action is to acquire services related to the VA eCMS user administration.  The contractor shall provide a full-time resource to deliver IT services in support of the VA eCMS program as described herein.  This resource shall be fully trained, with experience in using the eCMS and knowledge of VA acquisition business processes, to be able to provide direct support to eCMS users nationwide.   

2.1  Other Personnel Considerations.  Personnel assigned by the contractor to the performance of work on this contract shall be acceptable to VA in terms of personal and professional conduct and technical knowledge.  Should the assignment to this contract of any person in the contractor's organization be deemed to conflict with the interests of VA, or in the event performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory at any time during the life of the contract, the Contracting Officer will notify the contractor and may request that the person be immediately removed from the assignment.  Replacement personnel qualifications shall be equal to or greater than those of the personnel being replaced.  

2.2  Hours of Work.  At a minimum, hours of work shall occur during normal Federal Government workdays and provide adequate coverage between core hours of 9 AM and 3:30 PM.  Due to the requirement for close coordination with VA personnel, contractor employees are expected to maintain a work schedule that mirrors that of the VA personnel with which they work closely.  Occasionally the contractor shall be required to work outside the normal 6 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday production hours.  

2.3  Service Availability.  If the assigned Contractor resource providing services in support of this requirement is unable to provide the required services, for any reason, for a consecutive period of more than 3 workdays, the Contractor shall, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, provide a replacement at no increase in contract price.  Additionally, the Contractor shall provide a replacement (at no increase in contract price) for any full workday that the resource is unable to provide services, should that person's cumulative number of missed workdays exceed 10, for the entire period of performance.  If the Contractor is unable to provide a replacement as required herein, a deduction will be made to the Contractor's invoice to account for the reduced level of service, or, at the VA's discretion, the Contractor may be allowed to work additional time to compensate for such time missed.  If the VA chooses to reduce the invoice, such deduction will be based on the number of hours of service missed multiplied by an hourly rate to be negotiated at such time.  This hourly rate will be based proportionally on the total fixed contract price for the resource. 

2.4  Holidays.  VA will observe U.S. holidays designated by Federal law, Executive Order or Presidential Proclamation.  For a list of the holidays the VA observes at the performance location contact the COTR.

6.4.1	Facility Access and Security.

Contractor personnel performing work under this Order shall satisfy all requirements for appropriate security eligibility in dealing with access to sensitive information and information systems belonging to or being used on behalf of VA.

6.4.2	The investigative history for Contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO).  Should the Contractor use a vendor other than OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct Contractor investigations.

All costs associated with obtaining clearances for Contractor provided personnel shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  Further, the Contractor shall be responsible for the actions of all individuals provided to work for the VA under this Order.  In the event that damages arise from work performed by Contractor provided personnel, under the auspices of this Order, the Contractor shall be responsible for all resources necessary to remedy the incident.

Failure to meet these requirements within 10 calendar days, unless otherwise explicitly specified by the COTR, will be grounds for suspension or termination of all building and/or computer privileges, and removal from work on the Order, until such time as the requirement is fulfilled.

6.4.3	Contractor personnel requiring unescorted physical access to VA Central Office (VACO) will be required to submit personal identifying information (full legal name:  first, middle, and last), date of birth, state-issued driver's license or identification card number and the state that issued it, and name as it appears on the card) and may be subject to a criminal history check.  Visitors who are not subjected to the criminal history check may need to be escorted at all times by someone who has been issued a permanent VACO ID badge.  The cost of conducting the criminal history check is the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor shall pre-screen all personnel requiring physical access to the property to ensure they are legally able to work in the U.S. and are not currently sought by law enforcement authorities.  Adjudication of information discovered during or after the criminal history check is solely the responsibility of the Chief, Security Services.  Being admitted entry into the VACO, based on a finding of no criminal history, does not convey any security clearance.  Contractor personnel's physical access privileges may be revoked at any time because of personal misconduct, including any type of safety- or security-related misconduct, criminal conduct, psychological instability, including illegal use or possession of controlled substances, or financial irresponsibility.

If authorized access to VACO, each Contractor representative will have their picture taken and a permanent badge issued.  Contractor personnel shall conspicuously display, on his/her person, a Government-provided identification badge while on-site at VACO.  The identification badge, and associated data, shall be kept in a Government-maintained computer database for security purposes.  All Contractor personnel must provide photo identification, when requested by any VACO security personnel.  Badges issued to the Contractor's personnel, remain the property of the Government, must be protected from loss or damage, and must be relinquished to any VACO security personnel when requested, or upon completion of the work under this SOW.

6.4.4	Contractor employees performing on this Order are required to complete the VA's on-line Security and Privacy Awareness Training courses annually.  Contractors must provide signed certification of completion to the COTR during each year of the Order.  This requirement is in addition to any other training that may be imposed by the VA.

When Contractor personnel are on-site at VACO, Contractor personnel shall follow all established regulations, policies and standard operating procedures applicable to the facility.  Violations of VA regulations and policies may result in the Contractor's personnel being removed from the premises and may result in termination of the Order for default.  The Government will not be responsible for any of the Contractor's costs for replacement of personnel removed from a VA site for reasons associated with safety, security, and unprofessional or inappropriate conduct.

6.4.5	The Contractor shall obtain all necessary licenses and/or permits required to perform the work.

The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect persons and property from injury or damage during the performance of this Order.

Failure to complete the work by the required completion date, caused by delays in requesting security clearances, or due to revocation of access privileges resulting solely from the actions of the Contractor or their personnel, is not sufficient reason to warrant an extension in the Order time or amount.

6.4.6	VA reserves the right to order Contractor personnel off the VACO site and take other security precautions in the event of an emergency, Government shutdown, times of elevated security risk, or any other reason deemed necessary by VA management or security staff.  Contractor personnel must immediately leave the site and may not return until authorized by the COTR.

6.4.7	Only business directly related to this Order may be conducted at VACO.  All other business must be conducted off of Government property.  Contractors may only be on-site when conducting business actually associated with the performance of this Order.


6.5	Personnel Security.

6.5.1	The work associated with this Order has been determined to have Low Risk sensitivity.

DRAFT Statement of Work

1.	Scope

This statement of work (SOW) covers claims support services to fully develop the information and evidence needed to substantiate Veterans' claims for increased disability compensation benefits and deliver to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) claim packets ready for VA to make a decision.  Claims for increased disability that will be developed under this SOW are defined to include any Veteran's application for an increase in the compensation benefit paid for a disability already determined by VA to be service-connected, including claims for a resumption of payments previously discontinued.

Intake of Veterans' claims for increased compensation to be developed by the contractor shall include claims received at VA regional offices located throughout the nation.  

1.1	Background

VA's Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) administers the disability compensation benefit program, which provides a monetary benefit to Veterans who are disabled by injuries or illnesses that were incurred or aggravated during active military service.  These disabilities are considered to be "service-connected."  The amount of disability compensation payable varies with the degree of disability (if 30% or more disabled) and the number of dependents, and is paid monthly.  Veterans may file claims for increased compensation benefits at any time if their service-connected disabilities become progressively worse.  Veterans with certain severe disabilities may be eligible for additional special monthly compensation.  The benefits are not subject to federal or state income tax. 

Frequently, Veterans already receiving compensation will encounter deterioration of existing conditions that require re-evaluation for increased compensation.  Typically, this category of claims is among the least complex to develop, but nevertheless requires significant time and effort to develop complete packages of evidence in order to decide the claim.  Expedited development and claim package assembly by the contractor will reduce waiting times in communications between the Veteran, medical providers, and VA, facilitating timely compilation of fully developed packages that will be used for final evaluation of whether an increased evaluation is warranted.  The work described in this SOW contributes to VBA's mission by directly reducing the time and effort to fully develop claims and make them ready for decision.

Contractor personnel provide support services to the Government, and Government personnel always make final decisions regarding VA business.

3.	Deliverables

The contractor shall provide Monthly Status Reports including information as described in Sections 2.1.1.4 above.  The contractor shall provide all deliverables in formats as agreed to by the COTR or Contracting Officer.  Unless otherwise specified, all deliverables shall use Microsoft-Office-compatible formats.  Unless otherwise specified, project management deliverables such as project plans and schedules shall use Microsoft Project.  

4.	Performance Measures
Timeliness and accuracy are measured on a per-claim basis.
It is the Government's intention to incentivize the contractor based upon speed of delivery.  Conversely, the contractor will be monetarily penalized when quality or timeliness fall below contractual standards.

VA will assess the level of performance based on a 100% review of all claims packages received.   This review will be completed within 90 days of receipt of the fully developed claims package. 

4.1    Evaluation of Timeliness:
1)	Timeliness shall be measured on a per-claim basis using VA's tool - VETSNET Operations Reports (VOR).
2)	Time shall be measured in calendar days as:
Timeliness = Date fully developed claim package is submitted to the Government minus the date when established claim is received by contractor
3)	No early delivery incentive will be paid for any case found to have any errors.

4.2	  Evaluation of accuracy:
1)	Contractor accuracy shall be measured as a percentage fully developed claims packages with 0 errors.
2)	No incentive shall be paid for the month if the claims processed for that month do not meet or exceed 98% accuracy.  See Addendum A.	

For all claims pending with the contractor for > 90 days, details regarding status and issues must be presented in the monthly status report until resolved.  Development of claims must be continued at the contractor's development site.

For claims pending with the contractor for >120 days (after an initial report with summary has been submitted to VA at the 90 day timeframe) - the contractor is required to turn over the case back to the Government for development work along with all documentation and information collected thus far.  The contract shall be evaluated for non-performance by the COTR. 

The contractor must initiate contact with the Veteran on all claims within five business days of receipt of the claim. Claims where development has not been initiated within five business days must be presented in the monthly status report (along with reasons).

Failure to complete this mandatory training within the timeframe required will be grounds for suspension or termination of all physical and/or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training is completed. 

5.1.7 Contractor Personnel Security/Background Investigation

All contract employees who require access to the VA site(s) and/or access to VA local area network (LAN) systems shall be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Security and Investigations Center (SIC). These requirements are applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same NACI background investigation. 

The level of background security investigation will be in accordance with VA Directive 0710 dated September 10, 2004 and is available at http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=487&FType=2

The contract employee level of background investigation required for this effort is: NACI

5.1.8 Contractor Responsibilities

The contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations or reciprocals of previous investigations held that meet or exceed the required investigation level. The cost of the background investigations is as follows: Low Risk (NACI) $231, Moderate Risk (MBI) $825, High Risk (BI) $3,465 or Reciprocals $25. VA will pay for investigations or reciprocals processed through the VA SIC and conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in advance, however, the contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations/reciprocals to VA within 30 days of Bill of Collections received from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the contractor. If the contractor does not adhere to the Bill of Collections, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation/reciprocal costs.

Immediately after contract or task order award, the contractor must submit the completed Attachment B form (VBA Contractor Background Investigation Request Worksheet) to the COTR to begin the background investigation process for all contract employees working on the contract, who will have access to VA facilities, VA systems, or privacy data.

The contractor and contractor point of contact (POC) will receive an email notification from SIC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. Reminder notifications will be sent if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.

The contractor shall prescreen all personnel who require access to VA site(s) and/or access to VA LAN systems to ensure they maintain a U.S. citizenship or Alien Registration that authorizes them to work in the U.S. and are able to read, write, speak and understand the English language. 

Contractors who have a current favorable background investigation conducted by OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) may be accepted through reciprocation. When a previous clearance is currently held, it does not preclude the vendor from submitting a completed Attachment B form to the COTR immediately after contract or task order award for all contract employees working on the contract.
  
Contractor shall not commence performance until the SIC confirms that it has received the contractor's investigative documents, that they are complete, and that the investigation information has been released to OPM for scheduling of the background investigation.   Once the contractor's background investigation has been released to OPM for scheduling of the background investigation or the SIC has confirmed that the verified investigation will be reciprocated, contract performance may commence.  The contractor, if notified of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government, shall withdraw the employee from consideration from working under the contract.  Failure to comply with the contractor personnel security requirements may result in termination of the contract for default. 

If the security clearance investigation is not completed prior to the start date of the contract, the contract employee may work on the contract with an initiated status while the security clearance is being processed. However, the contractor will be responsible for the actions of those contract and subcontract employees they provide to perform work for VA. In the event damage arises from work performed by contractor personnel, under the auspices of the contract, the contractor will be responsible for resources necessary to remedy the incident.

Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or DSS to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations. The Vendor Cage Code number must be provided to the VA SIC, which will verify the information and conclude whether access to the Government's site(s) and/or VA LAN systems can be.

The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either OPM or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO). 

Contractor shall allow VA personnel to visit and inspect contractor facility to review systems, processes and audit any and all documents and information related to the contract.

The contractor agrees to document Technology, Processes, or Process Improvements developed under this contract, and deliver the documentation to the VBA periodically or as requested.   The contractor agrees that VBA has unlimited rights to use and implement technology, and processes developed under this contract.   This includes, but is not limited to: computer software, forms, spreadsheets, process innovations, or other intellectual property developed to support claims processing.

After the COTR has received Attachment B form(s) from the contractor, SIC will send an e-mail notification to the contractor and their POC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. SIC will also send reminder notifications to the contractor and their POC if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.

Upon receipt of required investigative documents, SIC will review the investigative documents for completion and initiate the background investigation by forwarding the investigative documents to OPM to conduct the background investigation. If the investigative documents are not complete, SIC will return the package to the contractor with corrective instructions.

VA will pay for investigations and reciprocals processed through the VA SIC and conducted by OPM in advance; however, the contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations/reciprocals to VA within 30 days of Bills of Collection from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the contractor. If the contractor does not adhere to the Bills of Collection, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation costs and may be considered grounds for default.

The COTR will notify and forward the contractor a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility (form 4236) when the investigation has been favorably completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the contractor of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government. 

5.2	Liquidated Damages

This PWS is further subject to the statutory requirement to assess liquidated damages against contractors and/or subcontractors under 38 U.S.C. 5725 in the event of a breach of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI)/Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  A breach in this context includes the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of VA SPI which compromises not only the information's security or privacy but that of the Veteran or beneficiary as well as the potential exposure or wrongful disclosure of such information as a result of a failure to follow proper data security controls and protocols.

5.3	Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure

It is agreed that:

The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source code, and other material deemed relevant by the VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the COTR at the conclusion of the task order.

The CO will be the sole authorized official to release verbally or in writing, any data, the draft deliverables, the final deliverables, or any other written or printed materials pertaining to this task order.  No information shall be released by the contractor.  Any request for information relating to this task order presented to the contractor shall be submitted to the CO for response.

Press releases, marketing material or any other printed or electronic documentation related to this project, shall not be publicized without the written approval of the CO.

<DESC>Request for Information VA-701-11-RI- 0150

Governance Policy for Web Solutions

 Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, on GSA schedule and the Open market.   

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for Web Mediated Self Help Services.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is challenged to develop web solutions in partnership with the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T).  The impetus for this partnership was the recognition that significant progress has been made in populating the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), and that this data can be used by knowledge workers using web based solutions and business intelligence tools.  An expected outcome from the agreement is the creation of a joint governance organization between VHA and OI&T to mutually support web solutions and business intelligence capabilities in a collaborative fashion.   There are four components of this framework: 
1)	An OI&T supported development, testing/staging, and release environment
2)	A collaboration framework that supports a set of community supported reusable components 
3)	A quality control process that facilitates continuous improvement
A governance process managed jointly by VHA and OI&T, ensuring that national standards are met. 

Scope of Work: 
The purpose of this effort is to support the VHA-OI&T web solutions partnership by creating the methodology and governance structure that maps to the release and quality controls of the existing VA Project Management Accountability System (PMAS), providing evidence comparable to the artifacts found in the Pro Path repository.  The goal is to create a governance framework that is flexible and effective with minimal process overhead while ensuring compliance with established rules and standards.   Specifically, the contract will provide a range of processes to establish a sustainable, balanced and cost-effective governance structure and collaboration framework. As such, program objectives include:
"	To define/refine the project scope, objectives and impact to ensure that processes can be accurately captured over the course of the project and delivered as a project plan
"	Establish a collaboration framework within the IDE that enhances reusability of web solution components
"	Support continuous improvement by creating a transparent structured product review process
"	Create a governance structure that maps to other established application life cycle management (ALM) tools to support overall process automation and reporting.
Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be one 12 month base period
Tasks: The VHA requires contract technical, analytical, and project management assistance to support the efforts needed to establish a well-defined, efficient and effective governance structure for VHA web solutions.

Task 1: the contractor shall work with all appropriate stakeholders and leadership to define/refine project goals and expectations, identify team members and stakeholders, and develop a project plan.

Task 2: The contractor shall develop a comprehensive plan for supporting the construction of modular services that will yield opportunities for increased efficiency by increasing the numbers of shareable services available for incorporation into future web solutions. Future web projects will consume these services for interoperability among web solutions.

Task 3: Following a significant review of OI&T policies regarding the rules governing vehicles used for information delivery, the contractor shall design a transparent review process for promoting web solutions in the development phase to a production level solution.  This process should outline the responsibilities of OI&T and the responsibilities of VHA and their joint responsibilities. The established process shall be transparent such that it is possible to determine, at any time, where each product is in the review process.

Task 4: The contractor shall coordinate with all appropriate parties to implement an overall VHA web solutions governance process that maps to the existing VA PMAS Life Cycle Management Tools. To implement this, a detailed Execution Plan shall be developed to ensure that all requirements are well documented and planned.  The governance plan shall be sustainable and promote the opportunity for shared responsibility between OI&T and VHA.

Task 5: Following implementation of the above tasks, the contractor shall establish and implement a performance management system needed to track progress and sustainability.  This system shall track performance across all applicable locations and allow for continuous process improvement.  A plan for controlling and monitoring ongoing progress shall be recommended and implemented in order to ensure that plans are sustainable in the short- and long-term.

 Submittal Information:
Contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements should submit a response of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.

There are two BEP manufacturing facilities - one in Washington DC referred to as the Eastern Currency Facility (ECF) and another in Fort Worth Texas referred to as Western Currency Facility (WCF). This is for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 subscription.
<p>Currently the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has a requirement for "CAS Team License and CAS Annual Support". This software package is to be procured from INFOR (formerly SSA Global Technologies). The BEP anticipates a FAR part 12 acquisition with a fixed priced type contract awarded to INFOR.</p>
<p>CAS software was installed at the BEP in the early 1980s. The CAS software includes the following: Bill of materials, accounts payable, purchasing, cost control, order entry, inventory control, master production scheduling, material requirements planning, hop floor control, general ledger, fixed assets, and CAS Data. The current requirement shall be for 24/7 access via internet, phone or other means. The access shall include: INFOR's global helpline question and answer database, INFOR's incident tracking database, and qualified personnel for advice on the software. <br />In order to maintain continuity of operations at the BEP, the BEP will need to contract with INFOR under a sole source basis. The CAS software suite is proprietary software to INFOR Global Solutions.</p>
<p>If your company is able to provide CAS term license and CAS Annual Support, please contact Kathleen.Reidy@bep.gov on or before Friday April 22, 2011 at 2 PM EST.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Control Service Company for heating ventilation and air conditioning software system technical support for the HVAC Automatic Logic Controls at 16 locations throughout the National Weather Service Central Region. This service is for a base year and four option years.
<p><br />The NAICS code for this action is 541512.</p>
<p>A dedicated server is installed in the National Weather Service Central Region Headquarters web farm containing Automatic Logic Corporation software. Automated Logic Corporation requires the certified group of field offices provide factory authorized support for their products. Having any work performed by other than the certified vendor would violate all factory warranties for all systems and devices. The authorized Automatic Logic Field Office in the greater Kansas City area is Control Service Company.</p>
<p>It is cost prohibitive to procure a new server and new software installed at the National Weather Service as well as new equipment and software at the 16 locations throughout the National Weather Service Central Region. If this functionality were to be re-established through another vendor, the server current server would no longer be maintainable and a new server and software interface would need to be established. Based on the complicated control functionality of the individual office control systems and the number of monitoring points, this would predicate a significant expense to the Government. The additional cost required would be cost prohibitive and the action would interrupt the function of the mission critical HVAC systems until the new service could be established.</p>
<p>Services required:<br />&bull; Contractor shall provide unlimited Automated Logic Controls telephone support with internet connection to sites for Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM at no additional cost. After hour and weekend support shall be provided on an as needed basis with additional preferred pricing.<br />&bull; The contractor shall provide major software version upgrades, service packs, patches, hardware drivers and any other updates required to keep the Automated Logic System Software and Hardware up to date and current for the applicable Weather Forecast Offices. This shall include the cost of the software and provide for the personnel to update the system as required. Upgrades shall be accomplished at least once every other year. <br />&bull; The contractor shall backup the Automated Logic System files and databases to a local web server as well as transfer a copy off site for storage at their facility. Additionally, the contractor shall provide a removable media device attached to the local web server that the backups will be stored on for recovery purposes.<br />&bull; The contractor shall review alarm and system logs and provide a report on anything which is found to be abnormal or needing attention as well as a list of all updates and backups that were performed.<br />&bull; The contractor shall provide continual training for National Weather Service employees for working on Automated Logic controls. The training can be held in conjunction with people outside the National Weather Service and the training shall be offered at various times throughout the year. The location for this training shall be at the contractor's discretion, but it must be within the Kansas City metropolitan area and this training shall be at no additional cost. Training may also be at a location of the National Weather Service's choosing for an additional fee.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the service submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at (816) 274-6993 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background: The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Program was established to provide robust scientific information regarding the status and trends of critical natural resources in the National Parks. There are 32 multi-park networks in the I&M Program. The Central Alaska Network (CAKN) consists of Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Denali National Park and Preserve, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, and the Arctic Network (ARCN) consists of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Noatak National Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park, Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. In order to track the condition of our parks, Central Alaska Network and Arctic Network scientists have chosen a suite of  key indicators, or "Vital Signs," to represent the overall health of the network. Each Vital Sign falls into one of 4 categories: physical environment, plant life, animal life, or human use. 15 vital signs relate to animal life, 12 relate to the physical environment, 4 relate to human use, and 6 relate to plant life. Underlying these 4 vital sign categories is a focus on habitat change. This focus allows us to predict and possibly model future variations on the landscape. With some idea about predicted change, managers can develop better strategies for resource protection. Natural resource monitoring is conducted primarily for two purposes: (1) to detect significant changes in resource abundance, condition, population structure, or ecological processes; or (2) to evaluate the effects of some management action on population or community dynamics or ecological processes. Monitoring data are most useful when the same methods are used to collect data at the same locations over a long time period (e.g. more than 10-12 years). The Inventory and Monitoring Programs are being designed to last for well beyond this time frame.Four of the Vital Signs relate directly to lakes and streams, and include water quality, shallow lakes, stream and river flow, and the distribution and abundance of freshwater fishes. These three Vital Signs are interrelated and represent different ways of examining change in these important ecosystems. To fully evaluate any of the various aspects of aquatic ecosystems, how those ecosystems may be changing, and what those changes mean requires an accurate and ongoing appraisal of the water chemistry of the systems (that is, what are the concentrations of various important dissolved compounds such as nutrients). Because the water in lakes and streams in Alaska is relatively pristine (unpolluted), the natural levels of many of these compounds are very low. This means that in order to accurately monitor these ecosystems, we must be able to accurately quantify very low concentrations of these compounds. Very few water chemistry vendors are able to repeatably and accurately detect the low levels we require, because highly specialized methodologies are required to attain that level of data quality. The Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (CCAL) was established over 30 years ago specifically to carry out these kinds of specialized analyses. The CAKN flowing waters program and the CAKN/ARCN shallow lakes program have relied on CCAL to analyze water chemistry samples since 2006.  1.	FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Per FAR 6.302-1(B)(1)(i) the  Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory at Oregon State University, 3200 Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331. is the only laboratory that can provide the services required due to the level of testing needed and continuity in data. 
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.

17. Total Dissolved Nitrogen (APHA 4500-NO3 F; APHA 4500-P J., detection limit 0.01 mg/l +/- 0.01 mg/l)
Laboratory specifications:
a. The laboratory must be experienced in the analysis of low-level nutrient concentrations in water samples from oligotrophic systems and meet the detection limits.
b. The laboratory must conform to EPA surface water chemistry criteria.
c. The laboratory must participate in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program.
d. The laboratory must provide a detailed Quality Assurance Plan to CAKN.
e. The laboratory must use prepared NIST-traceable calibration standards.
f. The laboratory must, when sample volume allows, run duplicate analyses for 10% of samples per analysis.
g. The laboratory must be located in Alaska or the Pacific Northwest to minimize transit time for shipment of frozen samples.
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).  The Central Alaska and Arctic Network has selected this laboratory to analyze its water samples because CCAL is capable of detecting extremely low levels of the chemical constituents found in Alaskan waters. Unlike most water chemistry labs, which specialize in the analysis of wastewater or water from polluted locations, CCAL specializes in the analysis of nutrient research samples from natural lakes, streams, precipitation and groundwater in unpolluted areas. Our samples are collected in pristine lakes and streams with extremely low nutrient concentrations; as such, we require the low detection limits provided by CCAL. CCAL has more than 30 years experience analyzing these kinds of water samples. CCAL is also capable of dealing with the high concentrations of DOC often found in lakes and streams in Alaska. The highly colored nature of water from these systems can compromise the accuracy of measurements and many labs are not equipped to deal with the required color corrections.CCAL has a well-developed Quality Assurance Plan that insures delivery of precise and accurate results. CCAL laboratory techniques conform with EPA surface water chemistry criteria and CCAL participates in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program, an external interlaboratory QA Program, to monitor the accuracy of analytical procedures. Participation in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program insures that measurements made in different laboratories will be of comparable quality and in principle will be directly comparable. Data produced by CCAL from a standardized set of protocols allow direct comparisons among diverse studies, creating a legacy of data that grows with each new study. This conformity increases the value of data collected by the CAKN and ARCN lake and stream monitoring programs and allows us to compare our data directly with that collected by other monitoring networks. This in turn increases our power to detect environmental change on a regional level.  By standardizing detection and measurement of the chemical and physical properties of water, and by eliminating the need and expense of establishing duplicate facilities, CCAL operations are beneficial to both cooperative and individual research projects. For these reasons CCAL continues to be the least expensive lab operating under a good Quality Assurance Plan capable of measuring the low concentrations that we require. CCAL is also being used by the CAKN shallow lakes program, as well as by other I&M networks, including the Southwest Alaska Network and the Pacific Northwest Network.Another important reason we selected CCAL was due to its relatively close proximity to Alaska. The water samples we collect must remain frozen until they are analyzed. It is not feasible to ship samples cross country as we risk the samples thawing and thus compromising the quality of the data. CCAL is located in Oregon and we can easily transport samples to the lab before the samples thaw and begin to degrade. When shipping from remote areas such as Kotzebue or Nome samples often arrive in Oregon partially thawed. It is important we have a lab that is close to Alaska.  The success of the CAKN/ARCN water monitoring program depends upon the ability to detect and quantify subtle changes in natural processes with confidence. 
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: A sources sought was conducted from 3/28/11 - 4/12/11 with no vendors responding.5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  

6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<SOLNBR>N6247008D1001

<a href="mailto:jen.mcdonald@navy.mil">jen.mcdonald@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>NAVFAC Atlantic intends to award a sole source contract capacity increase to Tetra Tech NUS, Inc. pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source, under Contract N62470-08-D-1001.  NAVFAC Atlantic intends to increase the contract capacity from $125,000,000 to $137,000,000 in order to allow sufficient time to award the follow-on procurement.  The work performed under this contract involves services in support of the Defense Departments Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) in compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976.
  Other services include Munitions Response Program (MRP) support, support of Navy and Marine Corps Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) efforts, and R.S.E.P.A. (Range Sustainability Environmental Program Assessment) program support.  The contract capacity increase is necessary to continue the vital work being performed under the CLEAN program and avoid costly delays that would occur should this work be halted.  While many of the contract actions that will be issued using this capacity increase will be modifications to current CTOs, it will be necessary to issue some new CTOs in order to continue work in accordance with regulatory schedules and perform essential projects in support of the CLEAN program.
  Tetra Tech NUS, Inc. has the resources in place to continue to provide these services without any interruption during this interim period.  Given the short time frame of the interim period, coupled with the time it would take to procure and phase in services from another contractor, Tetra Tech NUS, Inc. is considered to be the only source capable of meeting NAVFAC Atlantics needs without a disruption of services.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested firms may identify and transmit their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to jen.mcdonald@navy.mil no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on 03 May 2011.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Mary Haines, Contract Specialist, Phone 2402761505, Email mary.haines@samhsa.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for proposals. The Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), intends to award a sole source contract to the Mitre Corporation, 7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA 20854, to provide services for the SAMHSA Modernization Program. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is considered available from only one source (Mitre Corporation) based on the factors detailed below. 

The services to be provided are for the Modernization Program for SAMHSA.  The Agency requires new policies, processes, and procedures for managing and controlling the enterprise. The increasingly rapid pace of change affecting SAMHSAs programs and business requirements, the pace of technology evolution and advances, and the obligation to be fiscally responsible in its investment management decisions mandate that SAMHSA develop and implement sound management practices for its investments in information technology.  This Modernization effort encompasses a wide variety of enterprise engineering, acquisition, and infrastructure needs, which span multiple SAMHSA programs. The breadth of this effort will require: (1) Development of advanced Health Information Technology resources, tools, and applications to support the national health care reform agenda, (2) Integration of data systems, (3) Development of Quality Measures consistent with electronic health record guidelines, (4) Enhancement of Enterprise Architecture, (5) Enterprise Engineering and standardization, (6) Data management, data warehousing, IT infrastructure, and IT security, (7) Enhanced collaboration and information sharing, (8) Continued reduction of administrative costs, (9) Continued increase in agency efficiency in both administrative processes and the workforce, (10) Improved economies of scale through reducing the number of legacy applications by implementing enterprise applications, (11) Development of a standard technical reference for all of the Agencys production environments, (12) Enhancement of grants and contract content management strategies to better support health care reform and SAMHSAs strategic initiatives, (13) Creation and enhancement of program monitoring and evaluation methodologies, and (14) Strengthened security and privacy protection for SAMHSA systems and data.  

The Mitre Corporation is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), jointly sponsored by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Veterans Administration (VA). The FFRDC was set up as a Center for Enterprise Modernization (CEM). The CEM was established in the public interest to assist Sponsors in solving problems arising from the modernization of their enterprise and associated systems. The unique institutional characteristics of the FFRDC provide the SAMHSA Modernization Program with the following essential benefits: (1) Providing conflict-free advice on the practical application of enterprise system engineering, which includes strategic, technical, program and project management support and analysis advice and guidance in support of the work described, (2) Providing SAMHSA with continuing expert technical, analytical, and subject matter support that is free from the conflicts of interest associated with market pressures and profit-related work, and (3) Assuring the timely integration and application of many disciplines and functional specialties that are too broad and complex to acquire through individual, competitive procurements of commercial contracts. The services cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a private source because, as evidenced above, a FFRDC is required.  These services must be fulfilled in a manner that is consistent with the public interest, with strict objectivity, independence and complete freedom from organizational conflicts of interest. The jointly sponsored IRS and VA FFRDC, administered by the Mitre Corporation, has a mission to provide strategic technical and program management advice, guidance, and support services to the Government to facilitate the modernization and reengineering of systems, their operation, and associated business processes.  Among existing FFRDCs, the Mitre Corporation is the only known systems engineering FFRDC with such a mission. As a result, SAMHSA has determined that no other organization is able to provide the aforementioned elements specifically required.  Based on the above, the Mitre Corporation is uniquely qualified to perform the required work. 

The estimated performance period is a base period of 12 months, with four (4) 12-month option periods.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990. All interested firms should submit their letter and specific Statement of Capability response to SAMHSAs Division of Contracts Management by 1:00 pm Eastern Time, May 4, 2011, 2011, to Mary Haines, Contract Specialist, e-mail mary.haines@SAMHSA.hhs.gov--phone 240-276-1505.

<RESPDATE>050411
<CONTACT>Kurt D Allen, Phone 571-227-4128, Email kurt.allen@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the Testing and Assessment of Rail Cars Vulnerability. Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a contract to Transportation Technology Center, Inc. 5500 Dot Rd , Pueblo, CO 81001. This contract will continue Phase II of the work already initiated by TTCI during Phase I. On Phase I, TTIC completed a risk assessment to define appropriate blast scenarios, development of a detailed railcar finite element model, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of blast events, sensitivity studies using the car and CFD model, and reporting. Phase II includes acquisition of commuter, transit, and light rail cars for a coordinated modeling and test effort that will result in correlated models of the three railcar types. Light rail and transit rail cars have been obtained by TTCI, and modeling efforts are nearing completion on those cars. Structural steels from the light rail car have been tested at strain rates varying from quasi-static to very high strain rates associated with explosive events. These material properties define the nonlinear strain-rate dependent characteristics in the LS-DYNA railcar model. The modeling work has included investigations of three different CFD blast-wave/structure modeling methods (fluid-structure interaction is at the cutting edge of finite element analysis). Once tests have been conducted, the best CFD model can be identified and selected for use. Specialized risk analyses of the light rail and transit cars are essentially completed. The remaining Phase II work includes: finish models of the railcars, perform blast tests, correlate models to the test results and reporting.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

These receivers are the only acoustic receivers that will ensure compatibility with the acoustic tags already being used on a multi-agency study. The government intends to award this order to VEMCO non-competitively due to VEMCO being the only company that manufactures these compatible acoustic receivers.
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this receiver shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist no later than April 21, 2011 at 4:00PM EST. Any such statement of capabilities and qualifications received by the deadline will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Any questions received after the specified date and time above will not be responded to. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before 5 May 2011.<br />BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability, Past Performance and price will be evaluated. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price.<br />Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotation will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, lodging, and secured storage. Quotation must address the quoter's ability to comply with the ADA, as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotation should reflect the quality of services provided and maintained. (b) Location. Quotation will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the Arlington, VA area with adequate low cost or free parking for attendees, with multiple local transportation options that are cost effective for the government travelers. The facility has a variety of restaurants and other attractions within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. (c) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability to provide the required services on the dates requested.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: AFOSR will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements that AFOSR has had experience with, topics from on quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc) will be reviewed.

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.<br />Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>

<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>Gate 33 shall be used for all deliveries by truck to this base. <br />(Trucks will not be allowed to gain access through any other gate.)</p>

<p>Since your firm's delivery may be affected, ensure that your delivery carrier receives proper instructions on<br />delivery / unloading requirements for B / 3001. Unloading in designated unloading areas will minimize any inconvenience, and, attendant ramifications, which may accrue, to your delivery / delivery carrier for failure to adhere to this requirement.</p>

<p>Contractors working on Tinker AFB shall comply with all procedures outlined in TAFBI 31-101, AFI 10-245 and TAFBP 31-101.

Identification will be surrendered to Security Forces personnel upon demand for the purpose of identification, investigation, abuse, misuse, or for any other reason necessary. Civilian and military retirees who conduct commercial business on base must obtain a badge through their place of employment. ALSO OF SPECIAL NOTE, in accordance with TAFBI 31-101 para 7, all contractors/contractor personnel shall be subject to background checks as deemed necessary.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

The Intelligence Analyst Training is part of a U.S. Embassy-Department of State-Kingdom of Moroccan (KOM) agreement to develop the intelligence analysis capability among the Moroccan border security agencies. At this time, the Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie and the National Police have limited intelligence analysis capability. Moroccan Customs has a nascent capability at this time. </span>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">The development of this capability is critical as Morocco is the third largest producer of cannabis. In addition, Morocco is the major transit country for transnational criminal organizations moving South American cocaine through Northwest Africa to Europe. </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">Currently, the National Police and the Royal Gendarmerie utilize limited targeting and risk management techniques. Morocco Customs is not utilizing Western-style targeting or risk management methodology. They provide a monetary incentive for their inspectors to find contraband. As a result, Moroccan border security forces have been minimally successful in stopping the couriers but less successful in disrupting the transnational criminal networks coordinating the drug trade. </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">Training requirements identified by the KOM, the Department of State's INL funded and U.S. Embassy Rabat-based Transnational Crime Director. DHS/ICE Attach&eacute; and CBP/INA to assist in the development of an intelligence analyst capability follow. CBP seeks a highly capable and experienced Contractor meeting the following requirements:</span></p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">1) My questions regarding; Intelligence Analysis Training for Morocco, can you better project what time frame this Training is intended to take place? I understand that 25 April 2011 is application deadline, and training materials are to be delivered three weeks after the contract is awarded, that is May 16 2011. Could we reasonably expect to send instructors in country within 30 days of May 16th?</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">CBP Response: The analysis in the question above is not correct. Quotations with proposals are now due 4/27/2011. The award process is expected to take 1 &#8208; 3 weeks (or longer) depending on whether revised proposals will be required. Once award is made, the completed training materials are to be received by the CBP Project Coordinator for translation into French (by CBP) within 21 calendar days after date of award. The CBP Project Coordinator shall then schedule the training class to start in as little as 21 calendar days but as much as 45 calendar days after receipt of the training materials. Based on this analysis, it is premature to identify a specific calendar date by which the class will start.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">2) Second question, is this a one time event or can we expect that this training will need repeating or follow on training?</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">CBP Response: CBP has no known additional requirements at this time.</span></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of IV Gravity Tubing. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and for which the products meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, and Operational U.S. Forces. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV Program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, a vendor must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO's Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding the DLA Troop Support Med-Surg PV Program please access the web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is July 2011. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and 011-49-6221-172109.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of IV Gravity Tubing. Within MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $7,246,190.92. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top nineteen (19) clustered groups of the total one hundred four (104) clustered groups accounts for 80.12% ($5,829,002.52) of the total volume in sales ($7,246,190.92) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 19 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, robert.halliday@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor that does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Europe reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/ Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.<br /><br />Technical/Company Requirements: During the pre-source selection procedures, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The ten (10) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement.<br />1.

Vendor must provide documentation that IV Gravity Tubing administration, secondary sets, and extension tubing are compatible (can be added to an IV pump's IV tubing administration with your competitor's pump tubing (IV pump can be added to a functioning IV gravity tubing set without changing out tubing) in response to this RFIAQ (vendor that does not provide documentation to support any incompatibility, will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />9. Vendor must provide documentation explaining how much volume it takes to prime the tubing from the IV bag or bottle spike or most proximal injection port and the distal end of the IV tubing in response to this RFIAQ (vendor who does not provide documentation to support the tubing volume, will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />10. Vendor must provide a statement confirming products come sterile in a labeled package demonstrating the contents, expiration date, and lot number that can be delivered to a sterile field in response to this RFIAQ. Vendor who cannot provide products in a sterile, labeled package demonstrating the contents, expiration date, and lot number that can be delivered to a sterile field will be disqualified in Phase I (vendor who does not provide documentation to support this information, will be disqualified in Phase I).</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Europe, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). One box of each of the four (4) items listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>1) Set IV administration 10-20gtt vented/non-vented drip chamber, 104-112 in long standard bore tubing, flow regulator, with three needle-free ports, 4-way stopcock, manifold with 2 pots, luer lock, DEHP-free, latex-free<br />2) Set IV administration 60gtt vented 150ml Burette, 104-112 inch long tubing, flow regulator, two needle-free injection ports, luer-lock, latex-free<br />3) Set IV extension 6 inch long small-bore tubing, luer lock, T-adapter, DEHP-free, latex-free<br />4) Set secondary IV 20gtt vented drip chamber, 30 to 41 inch long tubing, luer-lock with hanger DEHP-free, latex-free</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each IV Gravity Tubing product sample from each vendor against the established criteria. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the criteria and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely unacceptable, two (2)-overwhelmingly unacceptable, three (3)-partially unacceptable, four (4)-acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the pre-source selection procedures, the MMESO CPT validated/approved clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal .03.04.01 (NPSG) Goal 3 - Improve the safety of using medications) The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops. <br />2. (Accidental Kinking/ Patient Safety) The IV tubing is pliable and is memory free.<br />3. Urgent Patient Care Settings/ Patient Safety IV tubing allows an effective priming speed, flow rate, and stopcock function.<br />4. (NPSG .03.04.01 Goal 3 - Improve the safety of using medications) The buretrol (or volutrol) graduation allows visualization of an accurate volume level.<br />5. (NPSG .03.04.01 Goal 3 - Improve the safety of using medications) The buretrol (or volutrol) automatic safety stop feature is functional.<br />6. (CDC &amp; NIOSH Publication No. 2000.108, November 1999 entitled, Preventing Needlestick Injuries in Health Care Settings, and the OSHA standards for needleless technology for needle stick prevention measures to prevent contracting blood borne pathogens) The needless luer lock port connection is functional allowing medication/fluid to be instilled into the intravenous system.<br />7. (CDC &amp; NIOSH Publication No. 2000.108, November 1999 entitled, Preventing Needlestick Injuries in Health Care Settings, and the OSHA standards for needleless technology for needle stick prevention measures to prevent contracting blood borne pathogens) The manifold needleless luer lock port connections are functional allowing medication/fluid to be instilled into the intravenous system.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified and invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost) will be selected.</p>

Technical factors combined are approximately equal to price.<br>Note on Price Evaluation factor:<br>Prices for food, inclusive of all service fees shall not exceed the per diem rates for breakfast and lunch for the location of the hotel.  Prices for lodging shall not exceed the per diem rate for the location of the hotel and applicable time of year.

<CONTACT>Janet Crowe 2027812933
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract for the procurement of MK57 MOD 12/13 to be installed on NIMITZ class ships, LHD 7/8 and LHA 6/7 and GMLS MK 29 MOD 5 to be installed on the CVN 78 and MK 73 SSTX spares parts to Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon IDS) in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. The Government anticipates procuring the majority of the equipment in FY11 with separately priced options for modernization parts and installations services in FY 12, FY13, FY15 and FY16. 

The contract will be for the production and test of the MK57 MOD 12/13 and GMLS MK 29 MOD 5.  The NSSMS MK 57 MOD 12/13 equipment procurement for the CVN 72 and LHA 7 consists of the MK 73 MOD 3 Solid State Transmitter (SSTX) ORDALT kits, MK 30 MOD 0 Integrated Radar Processors (IRP), MK 34 MOD 1 System Launcher Controller (SLC) and MK 29 Mod 4 Guided Missile Launcher System (GMLS) ORDALT kits.
  The GMLS MK 29 MOD 5 on the CVN 78 consists of MK 29 Mod 5 GMLS ORDALT kits and the MK 34 MOD 2 SLC.  The LHD 8 is being upgraded from a NSSMS MK 57 MOD 10 to MOD 12 with the installation of the MK 29 Mod 4 GMLS ORDALT and MK 34 MOD 0 to 1 SLC conversion kit.

Raytheon IDS is the onlyknown company with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources and infrastructure required to produce the MK 57 NSSMS, the MK 57 RNSSMS, the MK 73 SSTX and the MK 29 GMLS ESSM upgrade without adverse impact to the USN shipbuilding and ship deployment requirements. 

In considering the 18 to 24-month lead times for delivering this hardware and required ship installation schedules, it is critical to note that the procurement must complete in FY11.
  Raytheon IDS is the only known company that understands the system functionality and requirements to produce these systems to satisfy requirements.

No other source has the technical qualifications and necessary resources to perform the work described herein in the needed timeframe, nor will any other supplies or services satisfy the Navys requirements. 
Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly.  This announcement is published for informational purposes only.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) has been protecting America's livestock from foreign animal diseases since 1954. Dedicated to the advancement of knowledge related to and technology for the control and eradication of foreign animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, PIADC is a unique research facility whose mission includes the development of vaccines, performance of diagnostic testing, education, and implementation of various applied research projects. Located approximately 1.5 miles from the eastern end of Long Island's North Fork in New York, operational responsibility for PIADC was transferred from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to DHS in June 2003. Plum Island is a secure United States Government facility.</p>
<p>DHS is committed to using cutting-edge technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make our nation safer. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland.</p>
<p>An electronic Select Agent Inventory (SAI) program at PIADC is mandated by DHS and USDA. In order to support this program, a FileMaker Pro database has been developed to meet the requirements of both agencies and ensure that PIADC's Biosurety, Biosecurity and SAI procedures are implemented properly. Three groups on Plum Island, DHS, USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), will share and leverage a custom configuration of the FileMaker Pro application. Each of these groups of users has their own very distinct requirements. The current FileMaker Server 11 database consists of three files. The inventory, which is growing, contains in excess of one million records. Furthermore, there are 50 clients, each with a variety of security privileges for user access and reporting. The Government is seeking consulting and development assistance to improve the existing database. This FileMaker consultant/developer would be expected to complete an initial evaluation, and initiate some development under the oversight of an on-site FileMaker Pro developer/administrator.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) from the DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) on behalf of PIADC for the services of an experienced FileMaker Pro version 11 Platinum level certified consultant and developer to improve the efficiency and usability of the DHS PIADC Select Agent Inventory (SAI) database. The scope of work is based on one (1) expert-level FileMaker consultant/developer utilized for an approximate potential total of between 240 and 280 man-hours. Advancement from Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001 to CLINs 0002 through 0006, which is set up as an exercisable option, is predicated upon the successful completion of CLIN 0001. These services are considered to be a commercial item. CLIN 0007 is for travel in support of work performed under CLINs 0001 through 0006. DHS OPO is considering awarding a hybrid fixed price and labor hour agreement based on:</p>
<p>Attachment 1 - Statement of Work (SOW);</p>
<p>Attachment 2 - Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, as well as other applicable FAR and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) clauses; and</p>
<p>Attachment 3 - Service Contract Act (SCA) of 1965 Wage Determination for Suffolk County, New York under which this Information Technology (IT) consulting and development work falls.</p>
<p>The principle place of performance will be at the DHS PIADC facility on Plum Island with the address 40550 Route 25 in Orient Point, New York, 11957.</p>
<p>When preparing your quote, please write in your AMOUNT for each CLIN on the continuation sheets of this RFQ. Your quote is due no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday, May 6, 2011, to the following e-mail addresses: robert.marosz@dhs.gov and courtney.byrd@dhs.gov.</p>
<p>The award decision will be based on the Best Value to the Government. Quotes will be evaluated based on technical qualifications; key personnel; past performance; and price. This is an all or nothing RFQ. In addition, electronic verification using E-Verify (see www.dhs.gov) will be required for the individual consultant/developer working on this federal contract. Please direct any questions or comments, in writing, to both of the e-mail addresses listed above before 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, April 26, 2011.</p>

<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) is replacing in its entirety Draft RFP HC1028-10-R-2001 - Global Information Grid (GIG) Services Management-Engineering/Transition/Implementation (GSM-ETI) with this Final RFP HC1028-10-R-2001-GSM-ETI. (The Draft RFP for GSM-ETI and all attachments thereto shall be superceded with the information received with the Final GSM-ETI RFP).</p>
<p>DISA/DITCO anticipates award of performance based Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts to multiple small business contractors who provide the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Full and open competition will be utilized to acquire GSM-ETI requirements on a world-wide basis.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are cautioned to review the Final GSM-ETI RFP in its entirety. Although, questions have been received in response to the Draft RFP for the GSM-ETI effort and answers have been provided; additional and/or revised information and/or direction has been received which may have resulted in revisions to the answers provided.</p>
<p>Reference RFP HC1028-10-R-2001, Attachments 11 and 12.</p>
<p>Supplemental information (Government Furnished Information) will be provided on unclassified, sensitive and/or controlled CD-ROMs. Supplemental information is provided as an historical perspective of the effort that will be required from the GSM-ETI contractor and it is not to be construed as future work requirements. Supplemental information will not become a contractual requirement. Information considered to be "supplemental information" has been designated on a "Read Me" file included on each CD-ROM.</p>
<p>The Governnment is also providing a sensitive and/or controlled CD-ROM that includes a list of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) that the GSM-ETI contractor shall maintain. Attachment 13 shall become a contractual requirement and shall be considered an attachment to the resultant contract.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are encouraged to obtain the unclassified, sensitive and/or controlled CD-ROMs from the Program Management Office during normal work hours in accordance with Section L, Paragraphs L3 and L4 of this solicitation. The CD-ROMs are available at this time.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are reminded that the information provided on the CD-ROMs (HC1028-10-R-2001 - Attachments 11,12 and 13) supercedes the information previously provided on earlier versions of the CD-ROMs that were issued in conjunction with the Draft RFP for GSM . You are also reminded to dipose vendors to dispose of the previous disks in accordance with applicable security regulations.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are encouraged to review the requirement for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plans. An OCI Mitigation Plan shall be required from all prospective Offerors regardless of whether an actual OCI exists at this time. A contract cannot be awarded to an offeror who does not have an OCI Mitigation Plan that has been deemed acceptable by the Contracting Officer. Consequently, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to submit and negotiate an OCI Mitigation plan as early as possible.</p>
<p>Examples of recent and relevant past performance will also be evaluated by the Performance Confidence Assessment Group (PCAG). Prospective offerors are requested to submit their examples to the PCAG as early as possible; but no earlier than 29 April 2011 and no later than the proposal due date/time.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are also encouraged to support the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP). Assistance on helping wounded warriors transition back into the civilian workforce can be found at:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(End of clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman - Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman - Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.<br />Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) ( )In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of Modification 2, to Solicitation W91LV2-11-MobileDental, is to add a fourth Operation Ready Warrior Event (ORW) in Fort Chaffe, AR from 16 July - 21 July 2011 (Statement of Work (SOW) attached), post revised SOW's for the two (2) Fort McCoy and one (1) Fort Hunter-Liggett Events (sections 1 and 1.1 have been revised on all three (3) SOW's), add additional language pertaining to FAR 52.212-1(h) and FAR 52-212-2(a), post additional information pertaining to questions asked by vendors, and to extend the response date to 4:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 22 April 2011.  Modification 2 also deletes FAR 52.228-5 from the Solicitation.<br><br>Additional Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Language:<br><br>IAW FAR 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards resulting from this solicitation provided that all prospective awardees do not place any restrictions to do so on their offers and if it is in the best interests of the Government.   Consequently, offerors may bid on any one or a combination of any of the following Groupings of CLINs:<br><br>Grouping I:  Fort Hunter Liggett, CA: 06 May - 28 June 2011<br><br>CLIN 0001: Four (4) each Mobile Dental Practices CLIN 0002: Three (3) each Mobile Dental Practices CLIN 0003: One (1) lot Dental Supplies<br><br>Grouping II:  Fort McCoy, WI: 03 June - 25 June 2011<br><br>CLIN 1001: Three (3) each Mobile Dental Practices CLIN 1002: One (1) lot Dental Supplies<br><br>Grouping III:  Fort McCoy, WI: 07 July - 27 August 2011<br><br>CLIN 2001: Three (3) each Mobile Dental Practices CLIN 2002: One (1) lot Dental Supplies<br><br>Grouping IV:  Fort Chaffe, AR:  16 July - 21 July 2011<br><br>CLIN 3001:  One (1) each, Mobile Dental Practice CLIN 3002:  One (1) lot Dental Supplies<br><br>Proposed language for Evaluation Criteria for 52-212-2(a):<br>In addition to other evaluation factors, bids will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (multiple awards). It is assumed, for the purpose of evaluating bids, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation, and individual awards will be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs.<br><br>Additional Information (pertaining to questions asked by vendors):<br><br>- Dentists and assistant personnel are not required.  However, on ground IT and clinical operation support is needed.  Coverage will need to be adequate enough to be able to provide assistance to multiple locations that may be 30 - 40 minutes apart, on a given installation.<br>- Additional insurance riders for liability for the Mobile Dental Practices will not be required.<br>- Waste (both solid and fluid) will be handled by the contractor.  Additionally, all energy requirements are the responsibility of the contractor.<br>- Question:  Mobile dental practices will utilize the Apteryx commercial digital radiographic software that is comparable to the U.S. Army Dental Command (DENCOM) Digital Enterprise Viewing & Acquisition Application (DEVAA).  At the end of each event, all x-ray images will be delivered on an external storage device to the USAR personnel in the DICOM format. Our software does export images to DICOM; however, we do not have the Apteryx software. Will our software work as long as we are able to deliver images on an external storage device in the DICOM format?  Answer:  Yes, images in DICOM format from non-Apteryx software will be acceptable.<br>- All operatories must have water/sink capabilities.<br>- Portable buildings are acceptable as long as they are able to meet mission requirements.  They must be flexible for location changes without impact on clinical availability.<br>- The term operatory(ies) applies to the delivery of treatment, including exams, and corrective procedures.  Reusable equipment and supplies will be in sets for such treatment.  The contractor must provide all necessary equipment and supplies to sterilize durable equipment and supplies.<br>- IT support will need to be on site from 0730-1700, with 24-hour accessibility for issue resolution. A single individual may cover a given location, with multiple mobile dental clinics on different training areas.<br>- If portable buildings are used, the buildings will not require ramps/lifts.<br>- All supplies and equipment are not disposable.  Routine readiness treatment will be provided to Soldiers, to include fillings and possible simple extractions.<br>- Multiple training exercises will be occurring in the same location, with different populations. The desire outcome is to have enough supplies not to interrupt clinical procedures, (mainly exams) during Soldier in-processing to the installation.<br>- The type of dental chair required is one that "can move in an automatic self-propelled vertical direction and swivel in a horizontal position without obstruction, i.e. no field or hand powered dental chairs".  This requirement is firm - no similar type chairs will be acceptable.<br><br>DEADLINE:  Quotes MUST be received by 4:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 22 April 2011.  Quotes are to be emailed to joseph.haslach@us.army.mil or faxed to Joseph Haslach, Contract Specialist, at (609)562-2920.

I understand that 25 April 2011 is application deadline, and training materials are to be delivered three weeks after the contract is awarded, that is May 16 2011. Could we reasonably expect to send instructors in country within 30 days of May 16th?</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">CBP Response: The analysis in the question above is not correct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quotations with proposals are now due 4/27/2011. The award process is expected to take 1 - 3 weeks (or longer) depending on whether revised proposals will be required. Once award is made, the completed training materials are to be received by the CBP Project Coordinator for translation into French (by CBP) within 21 calendar days after date of award. The CBP Project Coordinator shall then schedule the training class to start in as little as 21 calendar days but as much as 45 calendar days after receipt of the training materials. Based on this analysis, it is premature to identify a specific calendar date by which the class will start.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">2) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second question, is this a one time event or can we expect that this training will need repeating or follow on training?</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">CBP Response: CBP has no known additional requirements at this time.</span></p>

Upon notification and approval of the 96th FSS, vendor may close services for the periods approved. The vendor may choose to be open additional hours as business warrants.</p>
<p>g . Concessionaire contractor is required to submit initial menu and pricing to 96th Force Support Squadron for approval. Deviations must be authorized by 96th Force Support Squadron prior to implementation.</p>

<p>b. Provide appropriate utilities: three 120 volts plugs running thru 30 Amp circuit breaker, above ground faucet, no water runoff. There is no drainage, so the concessionaire will have to be able to contain his gray water. The concessionaire shall instruct his employees in utilities conservation practices and shall be responsible for operation under conditions which preclude the waste of government utilities/resources.</p>
<p>c. The Outdoor Recreation Director shall conduct regularly scheduled visits to the site.</p>

Prior to vendor operation, Eglin Safety Office and Eglin Public Health Office will inspect equipment and processes. This initial check will be conducted prior to the start of the contract.

Market Survey / Request for Information (RFI) Announcement Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS) Small Business Set-Aside
This is a Market Survey Capability Assessment for Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS). This draft SIR (RFI) is intended to assess Small Business capabilities. 
1. IntroductionThe purpose of this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) is to: (1) Obtain industry comments on the attached sections of the small business set-aside draft Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS) acquisition.  This is the second of two draft SIRs the FAA has released for industry review and comment.  The first SIR was posted to FAACO on September 15, 2010, and a Comments Response Matrix was posted on November 18, 2010.  The attached 'ECSS Small Business Set Aside SIR Change Matrix' reflects only the differences between the Full & Open and Set Aside as they relate to small business requirements.  Multiple other updates have been incorporated throughout the SIR as a result of the RFI comments received; and (2) Survey the marketplace to assess the level of interest among qualified providers of the required services.
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that: This is not a SIR or Request for Proposals; The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals; The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and Any costs associated with the market survey/RFI response submittals are solely at the interested party's expense.
2. Description of the Required ServicesThe ATC Communications Services Directorate is responsible for the implementation and execution of communications infrastructure programs supporting the National Airspace System (NAS).  Three of the programs - System Wide Information Management (SWIM), Data Communications (DataComm), and NAS Voice System (NVS) - are designated as "NextGen-enabling" programs because of their fundamental role in supporting the transformation of the NAS to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The ECSS Contractors will provide vital support to the planning, procurement, implementation, and execution of these and other ATC Communications programs as they progress through their life cycles. 
The contracts will provide a broad range of Program Management, Acquisition Support, System Engineering, Operations Management and Support, Business and Financial Management, and other services required by the Directorate.  The requirements are more fully described in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  
3. Nature of the CompetitionThe FAA is contemplating award of two competitive single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts (one unrestricted competition and one small business set-aside) each with periods of performance of seven years (two year base and five one-year option periods).
4. NAICS CodeThe NAICS codes for the small business set-aside have not yet been finalized, but are currently expected to be:- 541330, Engineering Services - Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, $27M; and - 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, 1,500 employees.
5. Incumbent ContractorsThe ATC Communications Directorate currently obtains its support services through a wide variety of large and small business service contracts and task orders, most of which are expiring in the next 12 to 18 months.  The current level of effort is approximately 350-380 full-time equivalents (FTEs), but the FAA expects that quantity to decrease under the ECSS contracts due to organizational realignments and other efficiency gains.  However, the ECSS contractors must be capable of sustaining the current level of support if the expected efficiency gains cannot be realized.  The specific staffing requirements will be definitized through the issuance of task orders and the FTE levels referenced in this announcement do not represent a commitment on the part of the FAA to staff the ECSS contracts at a particular level of effort.
6. Contract TypeThe FAA anticipates awarding IDIQ type contracts with Fixed Price Level of Effort task orders being issued for the required support services. 
7. Responses to the Market Survey/RFIInterested parties should submit the following items in response to this Market Survey/RFI by January 3, 2011.(a) A one page letter of transmittal.(b) A two page Capabilities Statement (12 point Times New Roman font, 1 inch margins) that includes the following information: Type of services provided by your company relative to the scope of the ECSS effort as described in the draft SIR.

Number of years your company has been in business. Geographical areas where your company can provide the services identified in the draft SIR.(c)  Completed Draft SIR Comment Matrix - Firms interested in commenting on the attached ECSS draft SIR sections may do so by providing any questions, recommendations, comments, or suggestions that may assist the FAA in the development of the final solicitation document.

If any of the information submitted is considered to be proprietary, the submitter is responsible for marking it accordingly. 
Please indicate whether or not your firm would like to be included on the List of Interested Parties for the ECSS small business set-aside.

<DESC>The document containing these answers can be found at:http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solic_details.aspx?solid=423 
Below are the answers to Clarification Questions posed in reference to the RFI 
Please provide context relating to managing "dispositions" in 5.3.13. 
Answer: Please refer to the NARA GRS http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/.   A specific example would be the disposition of a FOIA request for nonexistent records:  GRS 14, 11,a,2.   The functions in 5.3.6 & 5.3.12 are very similar.  Please describe DOI's expected differences between these two requirements.  How would DOI differentiate these tasks? 
Answer: These are general records schedules capabilities.  There are specific bureau records schedules, as well.  For example, this link is specific to FWS enforcement records. http://www.fws.gov/policy/a1283fw2.html#Enforcement">http://www.fws.gov/policy/a1283fw2.html#Enforcement. Disposition may be suspended with proper authority.  Judicial and legislative authorities are two examples. We would want to capture the info pertinent to the hold and enough info to uniquely id the hold and cross reference it to the release.
What type of files are being referred to in this statement - "Permit easy and timely retrieval of both individual records and files or other groupings of related records" - email attachments, or files related to non-email operations? 
Answer: The purpose of this RFI is to ascertain technologies that are DoD 5015.2 Chapter 3 certified which can archive emails and attachments within emails.  Formats of attachments can be any electronic type document or related.  This does not include non-email operations, however, due to integrated technologies such as Instant Messaging (IM) into email based platforms, the Department would consider IM and IM related attachments as other groupings or related records.  Other non-email operations are not considered part of this RFI.
Is retrieval from NARA a requirement for you? Can you suggest any transaction metrics such as files/month or GB/month at XX retrieval time, etc? 
Answer: The retrieval from NARA is not a requirement for this solution. The Department does intend to eventually interconnect and cross-pollinate this solution with the National Archives & Records Administration (NARA) through the use of the Electronic Records Archive (ERA) package tool (http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/era/packaging-tool.html).  The Department intends to utilize this solution for its official email archive records platform.Is the intent to provide immediate management capabilities for all 80,000 - 120,000 electronic email user accounts upon selection of a solution? 
a. If not, what is the quantity of users required for the initial phase of implementation? Answer: The Department intends to implement this initially by mail server (qty no available as this time), and eventually support all 80,000 to 120,000 users within the Department.  A proof of concept consisting of no more than 5,000~ email accounts will be considered.
b. Will users be added in planned phases or as needed? Answer: Both. Users will not be based on single-instance but groups of users as defined at a later time.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for the United States to move toward electronic health records. The legislation requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information Technology Testing Infrastructure (HITTI) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the United States healthcare information technology (HIT) industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities.</p>
<p>NIST is responsible for leading the development of the core HITTI that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability for current and future testing needs. Initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities (e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology "meaningful use").

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) will issue a solicitation for SITE CHARACTERIZATION (ASSESSMENT) AND REMEDIATION OF LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (LUSTs) IN INDIAN COUNTRY, which will support the mission of the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) within the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER).  This action is set-aside as an 8(a) competitive solicitation in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.8.  Only SBA certified 8(a) firms may apply.  Offers from other than 8(a) certified firms will not be considered.  This procurement aims to ensure that leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) in the United States do not pose a threat to human health and the environment.  The background, goals, policies and statutes relevant to the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) program can be accessed via the Internet at the following web address: http://www.epa.gov/OUST.  OUST, in partnership with EPA's regional offices, implements the LUST program in Indian Country, and provides technical support to clean up petroleum releases from USTs.
The general types of support functions the Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) shall require with this procurement include, but are not limited to: evaluating sites for  LUST-eligibility; conducting site assessments (e.g., testing tanks for leaks when a leak is suspected, investigating a site to evaluate the source and extent of petroleum contamination); remediating contaminated sites;  providing technical field assistance to EPA for enforcement responsibilities; and providing outreach materials to assist with cleaning up petroleum releases from underground storage tanks, primarily in Indian Country, throughout the United States.  This is a follow-on effort to expiring Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts, EP-W-07-104, that currently supports OUST; and two expiring CPFF contracts, EP-W-08-072 and EP-W-08-073, which currently support the Region 8 LUST program.   EPA anticipates awarding one hybrid (T&M/FFP) IDIQ contract to support this requirement with a two (2) year base period, three (3) 12-month option periods, and two (2) 12-month award periods, for a maximum performance potential of seven (7) years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this procurement is 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services with a size standard of 500 employees.  EPA intends to obtain proposals through a competitive procurement process using FAR Part 15 procedures.  Award will be made to the responsible 8(a) contractor whose proposal represents best value to the Government.  The solicitation and all information pertaining to this procurement will be available on or about May 6, 2011, at EPA's "Business Opportunities with EPA" Internet World Wide Website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/index.htm.  
Information related to this procurement including any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted here on the Federal Business Opportunities website at: www.fbo.gov and the EPA website at: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/LUSTs/index.htm. 
THE EPA WILL NOT ISSUE A PAPER SOLICITATION. If you have any questions regarding this notice please contact (by email only) the Contract Specialist.  No facsimile or telephonic responses will be accepted.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1

The date responses are due is amended to read "NOT LATER THAN Tuesday, May 10, 2011, 12:00 p.m. (EDT)"  The deadline for questions related to this RFI are due not later than May 6, 2011, 12:00 (EDT) (Added). 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial market for potential Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions to improve the current acquisition reporting tools utilized by the Department of Commerce. 

Contracting Office Address:
U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)
Office of Acquisition Management (OAM)
Commerce Acquisition Systems Division (CASD)
14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Suite 6060
Washington, DC 20230
This is not a solicitation for proposals

Request for Information for a Acquisition Reporting Tool

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY  Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.  All response and response contents to this RFI will be considered information only and will not be binding on the parties.  Contractors responding to this request will not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the costs provided as a result of this request are best estimates only.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.  

The U.S. Department of Commerce is seeking sources, product capability information and pricing information to support a business case and budget for a new acquisition reporting tool/solution.  The focus of this RFI is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends.  

In its current state, the acquisition reporting system is cumbersome and time consuming.  Data must be pulled from various disparate systems in order to respond to diverse, mandated reporting requests.  The acquisition data for the Department of Commerce currently resides in the following systems:

Existing DoC Data Stores Used for Reporting Data
#	Name	Description	Owner	Database
1	C.Request	Census Requisition data	DoC/Census	Oracle
2	C.Request	NOAA Requisition data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
3	C.Request 	NIST Requisition data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
4	C.Request	OS Requisition data	DoC/OS	Oracle
5	C.Buy	Census Contract data	DoC/Census	Oracle
6	C.Buy	NOAA Contract data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
7	C.Buy	NIST Contract data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
8	C.Buy	OS Contract data	DoC/OS	Oracle
9	FIDO/FAAPS	DoC Acquisition Planning data	GSA	MS SQL Server
10	CFS	Census Financial data	DoC/Census	Oracle
11	CFS	NOAA Financial data	DoC/NOAA	Oracle
12	CFS	NIST Financial data	DoC/NIST	Oracle
13	CFS	OS Financial data	DoC/OS	Oracle
14	Momentum	PTO Acquisition/Financial data	DoC/PTO	Oracle
15	FPDS-NG	DoC Contract Summary data	GSA	Oracle
16	CCR	DoC Vendor data	GSA	Oracle
17	Bank Card	NOAA Bankcard System	DoC/NOAA	Oracle

NOTE:  Some DoC systems allow for cross-service functionality.  Specifically, NOAA, NIST and OS perform acquisition and financial services for other internal DoC bureaus and for each other.  Therefore, a bureaus acquisition or financial data may contain cross-serviced bureau data too.

Many of the systems used by Commerce do not provide a robust data collection and reporting environment which necessitates the need for a more efficient reporting tool/solution.  Further, several systems are separate and provide further challenges regarding consolidating and collection data from all DoC bureaus.  For example, there are four production instances of C.Buy deployed at Commerce one each for:  the Office of the Secretary (OS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Census Bureau.  The DOT Enterprise Services Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma hosts acquisition data for Census, OS, and NOAA.  DOT provides each bureau with their own environment that includes a separate instance of the C.Buy application and Oracle database.  Although also using C.Buy, NIST operates and maintains a separate instance at their Gaithersburg, MD offices.  Collectively, this means that C.Buy is currently located physically at two locations, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Gaithersburg, Maryland.   In addition, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) employs the Momentum finance and procurement system

. 

The majority of DoC utilizes Oracle-based financial systems.  These systems provide commitment, obligation and payment data.  The Commerce Business Solutions (CBS) Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland maintains the departments Core Financial System (CFS).  This system exchanges financial data with the requisition and contract systems.  The PTO employs Momentum as their financial and procurement system.   Momentum is XML based on their application layer and SQL on their database layer (it does support Oracle).  NTIS has a financial system called Budget, Accounting, and Purchasing System (BAPS) and is Government-owned, off-the-shelf software.  

Like all other government agencies, DoC is required to integrate and exchange certain acquisition data with components of the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).   At a minimum, the reporting tool/solution should be able to query and receive data from FedBizOpps, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG).  

While each bureau's data is currently stored in disparate databases, DoC would like to utilize a single reporting tool solution for collecting, consolidating and reporting data.  The overall objective is to expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency at the Department of Commerce for acquisition and financial data with one reporting tool for all data.  The long-term objective is to include other types of business data (i.e., property, human resource, etc.)    

The various systems at DoC continue to evolve.  It is anticipated that in December 2011, DoC will migrate the current acquisition system (C.Buy) with a new acquisition system called C.Award.  This is also an Oracle based contract writing system that is more tightly coupled and highly integrated with the current DoC requisition system (C.Request).  Therefore, our acquisition reporting tool must be easily configurable to meet the ever changing system needs of the department.

Overall Goal
Expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency with one reporting tool


Objectives:

1.Transform from a reactive acquisition reporting environment to a proactive acquisition reporting environment; a transactional environment to an analytical environment
2.Provide quick start-up, ease-of-use, reduce need for intensive & repeated user training

Pricing Information Request:

INSTRUCTIONS:  Please provide pricing information (in thousands of dollars) for each activity by fiscal year.  Pricing data should be provided over the 5 year lifecycle and the out-years should reflect inflation factors as determined by your pricing model.  

Budget planning is for the system implementation to begin in FY 2011 and be complete by FY 2011.  While costs in FY 2011 may include both non-recurring and recurring costs, it is anticipated that FY 2012 and beyond will be only steady state recurring operation and maintenance costs.  

For budget planning we distinguish between non-recurring costs to deploy the system (Implementation Activities) and recurring year-to year costs which represent Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Activities.  You will see some elements such as training in both acquisition and in operations and maintenance.  In this case, training in the acquisition phase is to train the initial workforce on new software, while in the operations and maintenance phase, the concentration is training of new features and hires.  It is important to keep the concept of segregating recurring from non-recurring costs.

Some O&M activities are not performed annually, such as certification and accreditation (a as tri-annual federal requirement) or hardware refresh on a three to five year cycle (depending on your own estimate).  While these are not annual activities, they are considered recurring costs to be reflected in the O&M section because they are not associated directly with deploying the system as opposed to maintaining the system.

Specific pricing information for activities will be considered a rough order of magnitude and should be based on experience with other similar projects and understanding.  It would be most helpful to include estimates along with quality remarks that you would deem to be beneficial in understanding your estimates.  These should be provided in a narrative separate from the spreadsheet in a separate MS Word or Adobe Acrobat document.

Following are the descriptions for the price elements to be completed in the spreadsheet.  Where reference are made to additional requested comments, please do not put these in the spreadsheet, but include them in a separate narrative in a Microsoft Word 2003 (or earlier version) or Adobe Acrobat document.

The WCU is used to remove excess heat generate by Units Under Test (UUTs) from the HPDTS Liquid Cooling Unit (LCU) when configured for operation with U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy Mobile Maintenance Facilities (MMFs). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Thermo Neslab Inc., Newington NH under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition, based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.
<p>The contract was awarded to Thermo Neslab, Inc. on 14 April 2011.</p>

Regular maintenance is required for efficient machine operation. Maintenance must be performed - at a minimum - on a biannual basis due to the very poor quality of water available in Big Spring.

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements; 
As implemented by FAR 6.302-1 the following statutory authority is cited as justification to award a sole source contract to Siemens Water Technologies Corp.:
(a)	Authority.
(1) Citations: 41 USC 253(c)(1)
"An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when - the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency ..."

	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  Pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(2) and FAR 6.302-1, contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures when the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source, and delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government. Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written justifications and approvals described in FAR 6.303 and6.304. This authority is cited because there is a written agreement between the parent company and OEM of the Elga Labwater equipment (Veolia Water) and Siemens Water Technologies Corp. This agreement expressly states that "Only Siemens Water Technology Service Technicians are ELGA trained and authorized to perform service as required on ELGA products in the North American market place." Using any other technicians than those expressly trained and authorized to perform the required service will render the equipment warranty null and void. 

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  There is an exclusive agreement between the OEM manufacturer and the vendor which is authorized to perform preventive maintenance. Since Veolia Water, the OEM, has only authorized Siemens Water Technologies to perform maintenance on the Elga Labwater equipment, it is  not possible to promote competition on this procurement.  

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government for the procurement of services during the base year and all exercisable options is $47,196.00. This amount has been determined to be fair and reasonable based on the procurement history wherein the West Texas VA HCS paid in excess of the rates quoted for this acquisition because of the usage of Desalinization and Deionization compounds used over and above contracted quantities in the previous acquisition of this service. 

In addition, the costs associated with the performance of this service at other VA facilities, specifically at Togus, ME and Manchester, NH, are the same price offered to the VA in Big Spring, TX. Finally, published pricing available to both Government and private sector users, with a single exception, are the same as the prices quoted for this procurement.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  During the period of January 21st through 28th, 2011, Internet searches were conducted to find any vendor that could perform preventive maintenance on the Elga Medica 30 Laboratory Water De-Ionizer. These searches revealed that there are no GSA contract holders which can perform this maintenance. VetBiz Registry queries produced no VOSB or SDVOSB firms that can perform this maintenance. Thus WTVAMC also intends to release a special notice of this sole source award utilizing FedBizOps, in accordance with FAR Part 5.  

9.	Other Considerations:  N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: N/A

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

 

13.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 

a.	Contract Specialist's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
