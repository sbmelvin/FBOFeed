The anticipated action will leverage the neutralization technology research development performed under the SCAMP Prototyping and Evaluation effort, Contract # W15QKN-09-C-0052, for development and demonstration of Countermine and remaining neutralization technology. The objective is to identify and evaluate technical approaches that would allow these capabilities to be deployed on a host vehicle platform that is logistically much easier to support and that can be deployed in larger numbers due to lower cost and smaller footprint.  The specific technology gap being addressed is the need for more effective neutralization capabilities on a host vehicle platform where Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) are highly constrained.  It is anticipated that the Government will issue a one (1) year, Firm-Fixed Price contract for this acquisition with an estimated maximum contract value of $2.54M.
The U.S. Army intends to satisfy this requirement utilizing the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B), substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delay.

It is anticipated that this solicitation will be posted on the U.S. Army JM&L, LCMC Procurement Network website located http://procnet.pica.army.mil and http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 19 July 2010. Please note this notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for upgrades and modernization of the control systems of six large power plant cranes located in the Third Power Plant at Grand Coulee Dam, in Okanogan County, Washington. For this acquisition the small business size standard is $33 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods and the applicable NAICS code is 237990 (Heavy Construction). This requirement is being conducted with full and open competition and it is NOT a set-aside.  The existing control systems on the cranes are constant-speed mechanical control systems and are to be replaced with digital variable-frequency drive (VFD) control systems.  The six cranes are: Ederer #4, a 50-ton bridge crane; Ederer #1, a 270-ton bridge crane; Ederer #2, a 275-ton bridge crane; Forebay Gantry Crane, a 275-ton gantry crane; Draft Tube Gantry Crane, a 70-ton gantry crane; and, a 2,000-ton RAHCO Gantry Crane.  The work includes removal of existing operator's controls, removal of all electrical equipment & wiring, and design, fabrication, factory/field testing, furnishing & installing of digital VFD control equipment and associated systems. This includes motors, brakes, limit switches, complete control systems including radio control systems, collectors and conductors, operator cabs, conduit, wiring, load cells and indication systems, mobile radio, and auxiliary devices required to replace and enhance the crane's electrical power, lighting, and control systems.  The work also includes asbestos and lead abatement.  The estimated magnitude of the construction contract is $10 to $25 million.  We anticipate issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) in July or August 2010 and offers will be due approximately 60 days after the RFP is issued. Due to the number of specification drawings included in the RFP, the RFP will be issued on a CD or DVD as the file sizes make electronic posting of the RFP impractical. Offerors will be evaluated on their: proposed work plan and draft CPM schedule; qualifications and experience of proposed key personnel; degree of recent, relevant, successful past performance of similar requirements; price; and other factors.  A site visit will be held approximately 3 or 4 weeks after the RFP is issued.  Prospective offerors are strongly urged to participate in the site visit.  A pre-proposal conference will be held the same day as the site visit, following a tour of the Third Power Plant. The pre-proposal conference will include a WebEx/conference call presentation.  Offerors unable to attend the site visit may participate in the pre-proposal conference via the Internet - more detail will be provided in the RFP. Registration on the Interested Vendors List via this announcement at www.fbo.gov is strongly encouraged to assure that interested offerors receive convenient and prompt notification of amendments or other related correspondence. To request a copy of the RFP CD or DVD, offerors must send an email request to gen-PNR-TPPCrane@usbr.gov. Email requests must include a contact name, physical mailing address, phone number, and email address for the contact name. Only one copy of the CD or DVD will be issued per physical address, paper copies aren't available, and telephone requests for the RFP won't be accepted.  The CD or DVD can only be mailed to U.S. addresses and will be sent via Priority or 1st Class U.S. Mail.  The CD or DVD can be sent via FedEx overnight if a FedEx account number is provided in the email request. An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov to receive contracts and purchase orders from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.  One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Eksigent Technologies LLC, 5875 Arnold Rd, Suite 300, Dublin, CA 94568-3167 for a NanoLC Ultra 2D System with a corresponding Autosampler (NanoLC Ultra AS-2) with the following specifications:</p>
<p>-	NanoLC-Ultra 2D System.  Dual gradient pump: 1-10 ul/min for gradient 1, 50-500 nl/min for gradient 2.  Max pressure 10,000psi.  Temperature controlled column compartment w/one 10 port column switching valve.  Includes Nano-LC start-up kit (p/n 801-00043) and Eksigent control software.<br />-	NanoLC-AS2 autosampler.  10,000psi 6 port injection valve (1/32" connections).  Two microtiter plate or 96 sample vials capacity; cooled sample compartment.<br />-	Nano-LC system installation and training (2 days).</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Proteomics Core Facility supports DIR investigators by providing proteomic data generation and analysis for their research.  It is very important to have state of the art equipment in the facility to develop new methods and analyses.  Eksigent's NanoLC Ultra 2D System with a corresponding autosampler has a dual gradient pump with maximum operating pressure up to 10,000psi.  This high pressure is very important for optimal separation of peptides that are obtained from many different samples provided to the NHLBI Proteomics Core Facility.  This is one of the advantages of Eksigent's system compared to others.  Three other Eksigent systems are currently in the lab that are coupled to other mass spectrometers.  The new system will be easy to operate since the lab is already familiar with the software.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 10 Center Drive, Bldg 10 8th Floor, Room 8C103C, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, and is a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-42 (June 16, 2010).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by July 9, 2010 at 7:30am Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2010-209-JML, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.

<DESC>Brand Name Justification or Equal - Solarhart Water Heaters
Apartment buildings in Yosemite National Park, constructed in 1988, were built with Solahart passive roof mounted thermosiphon solar water heating units. These units contain the hot water tank and the associated components all in one roof mounted unit. There is no allocated space within the building for water heating equipment. Multiple Solahart units mounted on Apartment Buildings 740, 741, & 742 have exceeded their life expectancy, have failed, and replacement is now required. Solahart is the only company that produces solar water heating units like this, and retrofitting a different type of unit is not feasible due to space limitations and required plumbing & electrical system modifications. Only Solahart produces a passive self-contained thermosiphon roof mounted closed loop solar water heating unit. Extensive Internet market research has produced no alternatives.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>SPECS: The possibility of generating eight frequencies, the engineer is able to check the shielding effectiveness very quickly. The measurement can be done at four frequencies: 8 MHz, 16 MHz, 32 MHz and 64 MHz. The measurements can be performed according to the following standards: MIL-STD-285 NSA 65-6 IEEE STD-299 MF-130D consists of portable, NiCd battery operated transmitter and receiver. Frequency and attenuation calibration is automatically operated by a microprocessor. The receiver is equipped with an LCD-display which shows the attenuation in dB at the normal operational mode. An alarm sound is heard when the attenuation is less than the selected level at the preset limit mode. <br />Saving and downloading the measured data You can save 63 attenuation levels at each frequency. You can download these saved values to a computer through a serial (RS-232) connection. The MF-130D Attenuation Meter set is provided with two diskettes. These diskettes are for downloading the measuring information into a computer. One diskette is for a Windows 3.1x operating system and the other is for a Windows 95 operating system.<br />Measuring magnetic attenuation according to NSA 65-6 / IEEE STD-299: Place the receiver and the transmitter as shown in the figure above at the point to be measured with the receiver inside the enclosure and the transmitter outside. The attenuation value may now be read from the meter. Measuring magnetic attenuation according to MIL-STD-285: Place the receiver and the transmitter as shown in the figure above.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager, Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) and Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) have identified a need for a family of camouflage patterns for uniforms and personal equipment such as, but not limited to, body armor, ammunition pouches, and rucksacks. A family is considered to be of the same or similar geometry with coordinating color palettes to cross the global operating environments.  Global operating environments are defined by a geographic classification system that subdivides the global landmasses into areas with similar environmental characteristics. Examples of these environments include but are not limited to: physiographic features such as arid and humid river plane, low and high relief mountains, plateau; land cover such as forest / full ground cover, shrub land / moderate ground cover, barren or sparse ground cover, cropland, snow and ice; along with seasonal changes.<BR><BR>We anticipate a family will include three uniform camouflage patterns, i.e. woodland , desert and transitional (sometime called universal), and one pattern for personal equipment (such as body armor, ammo pouches and rucksacks) which works with all three (3) uniform camouflage patterns.   The family must provide capability in the visual and near infrared spectrums. Detection and blending and effectiveness at various distances as the environments dictate will be ultimately used as measures of technical performance. <BR><BR>The following daylight visual detection conditions will be evaluated:<BR><BR>The woodland pattern may be evaluated in forest, full ground cover, cropland and jungle terrain at distances between 35 and 400 meters.  <BR><BR>The desert pattern may be evaluated in low sandy desert and high rocky desert terrain at distances between 35 and 500 meters.<BR><BR>The transitional pattern may be evaluated in both woodland and desert terrain types at the distances cited above.<BR><BR>All evaluations will be made with a subject mannequin and/or human wearing a uniform in the evaluated pattern and a body armor vest with ammo pouches in the family personal equipment pattern.<BR><BR>The primary method for evaluating uniform and personal equipment pattern effectiveness will be determining the distance at which observers have a 50% probability of detecting the camouflaged test subject; the shorter the distance the more effective the camouflage.  <BR><BR>The secondary method for evaluating pattern effectiveness, to be used in instances where all patterns are detected at the same range, will be the relative time to detection; the longer the time to detection the more effective the camouflage.<BR><BR>Near IR performance will also be evaluated at distances from 35 and 200 meters.  The patterns will be evaluated for Near IR performance in the same terrain types as for daylight performance.<BR><BR>The intent of this RFI is to investigate uniform and equipment camouflage development capabilities and technologies as described above.  The Government is conducting this market investigation to acquire information on the types and sizes of businesses that will be able to compete on future developmental contracting actions, potential costs, and data rights.  <BR><BR>Interested organizations that have the capability to rapidly address this request are asked to submit relevant information on their company/institution, product and capabilities within thirty (30) days following the publication of this RFI. Any relevant company background/experience, business category, costs, and any other information that the organization believes demonstrates their value / ability to meet the aforementioned intent should be included.  Respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and provide a DUNS number.  Firms may register for CCR at www.ccr.gov. All information will be controlled and used for governmental purposes only.<BR><BR>Responses to this notice are to be sent to PM Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, ATTN Dave Geringer; 5981 13th St. Bldg 1155, Ft. Belvoir Va., 22060 .  This notice is for information only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  No solicitation document exists for this action.  POC for this request is Dave Geringer (703) 805-8506, FAX (703) 805-8571, or e-mail david.geringer@us.army.mil.  E-mail responses should include Company Name and Sources Sought Number in the subject line, and a short synopsis which includes the following items of information; CAGE Code, Company Name, Business Type (Large/Small/HUBZone), Qualification (i.e current producer of iCVC, can meet production), Estimated Price, and NAIC Code.<BR><BR>Subsequent to the close of this RFI, the Government intends to solicit for and award multiple developmental contracts for the purposes of computer and field evaluations.  The developmental contracts will include a priced option for the Government to purchase the data rights to the family of camouflage patterns.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Market Research announcement to identify interest in a requirement for the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) which requires contractor assistance to conduct analysis and technical support in planning and implementing a JMC enterprise ammunition logistics strategy to meet the Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Commands (JM&L LCMC) Ammunition Enterprise Strategic Analysis & Execution (SA&E) requirements.  The goal of the effort is to enable true enterprise management of the ammunition logistics base.  The NAICS code FOR this announcement is 541618, Other Management Consulting Services, with a small business size standard o f $7M. Please indicate your business size with your information.<BR>This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the Joint Munitions Command to determine interest in strategy development to integrate and optimize the logistics and non-logistics functions of the ammunition enterprise to include other installation missions and activities, creating the strategic framework and operational and financial mechanisms needed to achieve true enterprise management of the ammunition logistics base.   This expanded view should be capable of identifying the business rules and guiding principles to effectively and efficiently manage the collective business paradigms/models, identifying and removing constraints from the JMC enterprise.<BR>In 2006, the US Army Joint Munitions Command (JMC) developed its integrated logistics strategy to guide key strategic and operational decision making in its logistics mission.  The logistic missions addressed included Standard Depot Operation (SDO) functions, specifically receipt, issue, inventory, surveillance and rewarehousing, as well as maintenance and demil.  The JMC strategy includes network, positioning, and transition strategies for making positioning and work loading decisions.  Specific benefits from the strategy initiative included: Identification of specific improvement initiatives; Development of an improved planning framework leading to stronger, more stable plans; Optimized positioning, out-loading, and economic viability through development of the strategic framework; Breaking down of stovepipes across logistics mission boundaries (i.e., receipt, issue, inventory, surveillance, demil, maintenance, rewarehousing); A set of guiding principles for decision making and problem solving; and facilitation of faster, better decision making leading to improved cost and efficiency.  Non-SDO missions and activities were not included in the analysis (i.e., production, 3rd party, etc.).  <BR>This scope will expand the area of consideration to all mission areas at the JMC GOGOs.  JMC Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) installations will be outside of this scope with the exception of Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD).  <BR>JMC has the following Technical Requirements: The contractor shall provide analytical and technical support in planning and implementing the JMC enterprise ammunition logistics strategy.  This scope will integrate JMC Munitions Logistics Readiness Center (MLRC) controlled SDO, maintenance and demil functions, with Program Manager (PM)/Service generated SDO and other installation mission functions which includes but is not limited to production, 3rd party, chemical demil, and ammunition peculiar equipment at these same installations, and will create a holistic and robust integrated strategic framework for enterprise management of the JMC ammunition logistics network.  The contractor shall develop and codify the strategy.  The contractor shall develop guiding principles and processes, which will define integration and optimization of SDO and non-SDO missions and metrics to evaluate the ammunition logistics enterprise in terms of an effective and efficient logistics base at both the installation and overarching enterprise levels.  The developed approach and methodology will be staffed and validated by both the JMC Headquarters leadership and the installation Commanders.  The contractor shall develop financial and operational metrics to enable enterprise management of the ammunition logistics base.  The contractor shall develop risk measures and management plans to assess and articulate levels of risk to the various missions of the JMC ammunition logistics enterprise.  This support may include, but not be limited to, analysis of various JMC installations mission and financials, development of various execution scenarios, and assistance in developing the final implementation plan. The contractor shall provide analytical and technical support in creating a communication plan for internal and external implementation of a holistic and integrated strategic framework for enterprise management of the ammunition logistics network.  The contractor shall develop the process and associated metrics to establish an enterprise wide ammunition logistics framework, which clearly establishes a robust ammunition logistics strategy and an implementation path.  The contractor shall develop the methodology to articulate the process of driving the JMC enterprise from a profit center to a cost center based organization with metrics that depict multi level impacts and risk mitigation strategies.  Top-level metrics will address readiness, ARFORGEN, Army transformation, and enterprise level health.  Installation drill down metrics will address financials, readiness, manpower, operations in relation to cost center impacts on Net Operating Result (NOR) and manpower.  The contractor shall provide the analytical and technical support to establish a fact based baseline, assess the current operational situation, path forward, and approach.  The contractor shall provide the analytical and technical support to conduct deep dive analysis, quantify strategic drivers, and develop a strategic framework.  The contractor shall provide the analytical and technical support to synthesize, validate, and codify expanded/or revise integrated ammunition logistics strategy to include implementation roadmap and a list of recommended lean and six sigma  projects and recommended improvement initiatives.  The contractor shall provide analytical and technical expertise as directed in the development and refinement of one-time or reoccurring reports/analyses/taskings required internally to the JMC ammunition logistics enterprise, or by higher echelons, to support the planning, development, or execution of the JMC ammunition logistics enterprise program/plan.  The contractor shall evaluate the JMC Logistics Enterprise to identify potential enhancements.  Identified enhancements will be qualified and/or quantified in terms of cost, schedule, and quality.  The Government will evaluate proposed enhancements and direct their implementation. The contractor shall provide two follow-on independent assessments of JMC implementation of the strategic framework at a six-month and twelve month intervals after JMC receives the final deliverable product.  A monthly progress report detailing accomplishments and expenditures at the completion of each month shall be submitted. The aforementioned tasks and submittals will be accomplished with the help of Government Furnished Data and Equipment as needed to compete the tasks. May require travel to various Continental United State s (CONUS) based sites.<BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES: Request that all interested offerors provide a capability statement, NTE ten (10) pages that detail their previous work experience in the areas of expertise and any specialized systems experience with the computer programs listed above.

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement to upgrade, replace or installation of ADP telecommunications and transmission infrastructure at various facilities per Section C specifications.
The projects will update facilities where they will be able to meet security requirements and meet the minimum standards for nationally required equipment installations.  The projects are necessary to continue the upgrade and standardization of the infrastructure to support required FAA programs and IT's mission to support the customer.  The condition of pre-existing copper cable is substandard, prevents full utilization of the network, and negatively impacts network and customers.
The Offeror will propose a price inclusive of materials for each CLIN.
Estimated Cost: $225,000.00 - $350,000.00
This specification identifies all labor, materials, plant and equipment to perform the work required to construct the facility.  All material not specifically indicated as Government-Furnished Materials or GFM shall be furnished by the Contractor.  All work performed and all materials and equipment used shall be subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.  This shall include, but not be limited to, installing, testing, inspection, scheduling, reporting and submittals.
PURPOSE:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Eastern Service Area is seeking qualified firms to upgrade, replace or installation of ADP telecommunications and transmission infrastructure at various facilities per Section C specifications.  This acquisition is set-aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) 8(a) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this effort is 238210, Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors.  The qualification process will be based on the Evaluation Criteria stated in the SIR.  FAILURE TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION THAT IS REQUESTED BELOW FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES SHALL ELIMINATE THE OFFEROR FROM RECEIVING THE AWARD.
In addition, this SIR will serve as a pre-qualification process for future, similar projects other than the above within the Eastern Logistics Service Area and will be based on the Evaluation Criteria stated in Section M.  Qualified contractors will be randomly selected off of the pre-qualification list to receive the Statement of Work (SOW) and Section B, Supplies/Services & Price/Cost form for the future project(s).  FAILURE TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION THAT IS REQUESTED FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES SHALL ELIMINATE THE OFFEROR FROM RECEIVING THE SOW(S) FOR FUTURE PROJECT(S).
This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm fixed-price contract.  A total of four (4) awards may result from this solicitation, one for New York Center, one for Albany ATCT, one for Atlanta ARTCC and one for Orlando TRACON.
EVALUATION INFORMATION:
Each potential vendor will be evaluated on the information provided in response to this SIR.  Firms should ensure that the information provided is true and sufficiently complete so as not to be misleading nor require additional clarification.
Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable" in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, shall render the offer proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration. The government may reject any and all proposals and waive informalities or irregularities in proposals. One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify proposals, resolve issues and omissions, etc.
BASIS FOR AWARD:
The Government will award a contract to the offeror with the lowest price technically acceptable.  A price is "reasonable" if it does not exceed that which a prudent person would pay in the conduct of a competitive business.  When determining reasonableness, the Government reserves the right to compare each offerors' proposed prices to the competing offerors' proposed price.  This is a negotiated procurement which may or may not include discussions with the offerors.  
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically on CD.  Offerors wishing to submit a proposal, modification or withdrawal through the U.S. Postal Service, Certified and Registered Mail, Special Delivery or U.S. Postal Express shall address correspondence to:

<DESC>This is a sources-sought synopsis for the purpose of market research. This is not a pre-solicitation notice or a request for proposals.
<p>The Forest Service contemplates a need for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Big Thorne project on Southeast Alaska's Prince of Wales Island. In a letter to Chief of the Forest Service dated September 17, 2008, the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment directed the Forest Service to develop a number of ten-year timber sale offerings, each with the capability of providing an average annual harvest of 15 to 20 MMBF per year for 10 years. The Chief's reply to the Under Secretary identified five areas that could meet the requirements for a ten-year timber sale; Prince of Wales Island was among those areas listed. A purpose of this sources-sought synopsis is to determine if the needed EIS can be prepared by a contractor. In such a case, the contractor will lead and provide the complete solution to prepare and produce a draft and final EIS (and all work needed to arrive at a draft and final EIS including scoping and development of alternatives) so that the Tongass National Forest Supervisor can make a decision regarding the Big Thorne project. The contractor's efforts will include reviews of existing data, creating resource reports, managing public involvement and comments, identifying issues and alternatives that address issues, analysis by alternatives and comparison of alternatives, preparation and publishing of a draft EIS, and preparation and publishing of a final EIS. No fieldwork will be expected of contractor.</p>
<p>The Forest Service has developed a draft Statement of Objectives, which is attached to this sources-sought synopsis. The Forest Service contemplates using the procedures of FAR Subpart 8.4 (Federal Supply Schedules) to invite proposals from Schedule 899-1 vendors for a firm-fixed-price task order award during the current 2010 fiscal year. A purpose of this sources-sought synopsis is to invite feedback from industry on the draft Statement of Objectives and on all aspects of the proposed acquisition approach for the purpose of helping the Forest Service obtain the needed services and deliverables in the most effective and efficient manner. Interested parties are invited to provide any comments or recommendations that might be helpful in the preparation and conduct of this acquisition, and responses will be sincerely appreciated. The contracting officer is not limiting inputs to certain narrow questions but is inviting input on all matters of this acquisition. Comments should be sent to the contracting officer by fax marked for "John Inman / Contracting Officer / Big Thorne EIS SS-10-0080", at 907.228.6254 or 6215, on or before Friday, July 16, 2010. At this point in time, please no phone calls or e-mails.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY
<p>N1022-10-0005 29 June 2010</p>
<p><br />From: COMSC N1022</p>
<p>Subject: Budget Preparation System for Military Sealift Command</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT AN OFFER. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY ANY COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION OF ANY SUBMISSION TO THIS MARKET SURVEY, OR TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES.</p>
<p>Military Sealift Command Technical Code N63 requests information regarding the availability of a replacement for the current Budget Preparation System, and requires a holistic view of a system, processes, technical specification, level of effort required, and summary cost forecasts for a proposed solution.</p>
<p>MSC's N63 IT enterprise architecture is composed of multiple elements, at the forefront of which is an implementation of Oracle Federal Financials from the eBusiness suite of applications. MSC's current budget solution is a custom application that integrates into that environment. The MSC is unique because it has administrative responsibility to both the Department of the Navy (DON) and to USTRANSCOM. It therefore operates two separate Working Capital Fund (WCF) accounts - the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) and the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF), each of which is funded from revenue generated from its customers. MSC must submit separate budgets and fully recover costs for each WCF. MSC's customers pay for their services through daily ship per diem rates, which are calculated based on cost recovery and incorporation of prior year gains and losses, and through reimbursable charges. MSC sets the stabilized per diem rates each fiscal year during the budget cycle, and these rates last through the applicable execution year.</p>
<p>This information is being requested as part of the ongoing commitment to provide the MSC with the best possible tools and processes that most closely align to strategic goals. The goal is to obtain one off the shelf software product which can meet the specifications/tasks in the attached spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall furnish the following minimum information:<br />a) Name of company;<br />b) Telephone Number, Fax Number, Address, and e-mail address (if available);<br />c) Background of company as it relates to this requirement.<br />d) Completion of the attached spreadsheet. Detailed directions for filling out the table are as follows:</p>
<p>Each numbered box describes the high level category of the requirement (both Functional and Technical) for the budget system. In the two boxes after the requirement, indicate whether the solution meets the requirements without customization or with customization. These are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Out of the Box: the system and software only requires simple configuration to customize the system to meet business requirements with no extensive development. If this is true, mark with an &lsquo;X' and fill out the "Description" field;</p>
<p>Customization: the system requires some level of custom development of user interfaces, features or functionality, the purchase of additional system modules not included in the out-of-box version, or any other additional effort. If this is true, mark with an &lsquo;X' and fill out the "Description" field;</p>
<p>The response in the tables should clearly state the ability of the software solution to provide the capabilities described - both functional and technical. Ability should be addressed in terms of base functionality or ability to meet requirements if additional custom development (not just configuration) is needed.</p>
<p>The point of contact for this action is Stefani Nick at (202) 685-5938.</p>
<p>It is requested that the above information be provided no later than 20 July 2010. Responses should be faxed to (202) 685-5965 or emailed to<br />Stefani.nick@navy.mil</p>

The government will investigate complaints from AFRI/RIR about the contractor's management of the individual research efforts (i.e. schedule compliance, product delivery, cost control, etc...). Though the government may inspect as much as deemed as appropriate, given the nature of the research and individuality of research techniques it is the government's intent to limit inspections to various peer reviews. QAP shall be responsible for initially validating and documenting substandard customer complaints and disagreements. If the contractor challenges the validity of any complaint, and the QAP and contractor cannot come to agreement, the complaint in question shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer for resolution. The contracting officer shall make final determination of the validity of customer complaint(s) in cases of disagreement with the contractor.<br /><br />4.1.3.

By awarding this contract to someone else the government would lose both time and money. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 511210 and the Size Standard is $25M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.

This notice satisfies the requirement of FAR 5.203 for publicizing contract opportunities and is NOT a notice for receipt of competitive quotes.  Responses to this notice must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to award a sole source contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to James A. Rose, via email: James.Rose3@va.gov.  All feedback received will be taken into consideration: however, the agency reserves the right to not utilize the comments or any other information provided.

All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft.

<DESC><p>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;&nbsp;quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote(RFQ)#NLRB-F0-246-06. This RFQ will result in the award of a Firm Fixed Price contract for flooring installation for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42, effective June 16, 2010.</p>
<p><strong>1. Scope: <br /></strong>1.1 Objective. <br />The objective of this proposal is to procure a contractor's service to professionally install a new flooring (according to manufacturers installation techniques) after first removing and disposing of the current flooring in a manner stipulated by environmental regulation and law in the Aerobic Room of the Fitness Center which is located in the NLRB Headquarters Building, 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20570. The dimensions of the Aerobic Room are 47'x25'x6'.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tasks Including But Not Limited To: <br /></strong>The successful bidder shall at a minimum furnish all labor and materials to accomplish the following: <br />2.1 Remove existing strip flooring in the Aerobic Room (47'x25'x6') and dispose the removed material in an environmentally safe manner.<br />2.2 Supply and install six (6) mil plastic barriers.<br />2.3 Supply and install two (2) layers of plywood: <br />2.3(a) One layer 5/8" tongue and grooved and the other layer &frac12;" with 3/8" cushioned "thrust-a-pads" attached to the first layer to add bounce.<br />2.4 Supply 2-1/4" wide x &frac34;" thick oak flooring nailed directly on plywood. <br />2.5 Sand and finish with three (3) coats of water based urethane-satin finish.<br />2.6 Install new vent cove base on walls.<br />2.7 Install a new threshold at doors.<br /><strong>The MLRB may consider alternative technical proposals to achieve the same results.<br /></strong><br /><strong>3. Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)</strong> <br />3.1 The COTR will be Michael Havas, Inventory Management Specialist, Property and Facilities Branch, National Labor Relations Board, telephone (202) 273-4040 and facsimile (202) 273-2849. The COTR has the responsibility for monitoring the performance of the contract. In no event is the COTR empowered to change any of the terms and conditions of the contract. The Contracting Officer (CO) is the only individual authorized to make changes to the contract, and will do so by properly executing necessary modifications.</p>
<p><strong>4. Period of Performance. <br /></strong>4.1 The period of performance will start the date of award and end in 90 calendar days at which time the requirement shall be completed. Work shall be performed Mondays through Fridays, during NLRB's regular business hours, 8:30am to 5:00pm</p>
<p><strong>5. Basis For Award: <br /></strong>The objective of the NLRB is to select the&nbsp;quote that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the flooring installation requirements covered in this solicitation.&nbsp; The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit&nbsp;quotes that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB. To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration&nbsp;(CCR) database.&nbsp; The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in the price proposal for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p><strong>6. Evaluation Criteria: <br /></strong>The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on&nbsp;the requirements stated in this solicitation.&nbsp;Award will be made to the offeror deemed the Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) offer. The Government intends to evaluate&nbsp;quotes and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br />In case of a receipt of a large number of quotes, the Contracting Officer will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award.<br />First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />a. If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />b. If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.<br />c. After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.<br /><br />The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Quote Submission:</strong><br />Quotes are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English.&nbsp;The Quote submission shall include a tecnical proposal and a price quote. The Technical proposal shall address all the salient points of this solicitation and provide confidence in the ability of the contractor&nbsp;to properly complete the&nbsp;instsallation of&nbsp;the Aerobic Room flooring.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Quotes are due by 4:00 p.m. EDT on July 9, 2010</strong> via email to Douglas Wolf at doug.wolf@nlrb.gov or by regular mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for one (1) datalink system and three (3)compatible handheld transmitter/receivers.  The DEA anticipates that this requirement will be fulfilled by a sole source purchase order awarded to L-3<BR>Communications under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  A solicitation will not be issued.
The data link system shall be a broadband transmitter/receiver for applications such as video downlinks from airborne platforms to the ground.  The system shall have the ability to communicate directly with the military and National Guard and must communicate directly with ground terminals used by these entities.  It shall be capable of operating over four frequency bands (Ku, C, S, and L) and shall have digital encryption capabilties for each band, as opposed to analog.  It shall also have multiple Department of Defense approved wave forms.  Additionally, the three portable transmitter-receivers required shall be compatible with this datalink system and shall have the capability to simultaneoulsy transmit and receive data.  The DEA has identified the Compact Multi-Band Data Link System and Rover 5i transmitter/receiver, both developed by L-3 Communications (L-3), as the sole data link system and transmitter/receiver capable of meeting the requirements set forth.  Any respon! sible source, however, may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation if it -- in good faith -- determines it produces or distributes a datalink system and compatible transmitter/receiver that meets DEA's requirement.  
All communications concerning this announcement must be in writing and be received by 2:00 p.m. Eastern time, not later than 30 days after the publication date of this notice.  Email communication is acceptable and shall be addressed to Cornelia Robinson at cornelia.robinson@usdoj.gov, with the subject line: "DJD-10-N-0054".

<p><br />PART 3: REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>3.1 Introduction<br />The following statement of work outlines the need and requirements for the purchase of a High performance Dual Pressure Linear Ion trap mass spectrometer with subsequent service agreement option years.</p>
<p>3.2 Background<br />The instrument, when interfaced with an existing 2-dimensional liquid chromatography instrument (Eksigent 2D-nano-LC system), will allow for the accurate identification and characterization of proteins in complex biological matrices such as animal tissues, milk and bronchial fluids. The identification of proteins in biological samples is critical for the execution and completion of biomarker studies currently being conducted in HFV-520 and for the establishment of biomarkers for use as regulatory criteria. The inclusion of an ETD cell with the ion trap mass spectrometer will allow for the characterization of potential post-translational modifications of identified protein biomarkers.</p>
<p>3.3 Scope<br />The High performance Dual Pressure Linear Ion trap mass spectrometer is needed to support on-going proteomic research at the Office of Research. Specific proteomic studies that are included in the Office of Research 3 Year Plan include the identification and characterization of differential protein expression in both bovine (cow) and caprine (goat) milk following experimental induction of coliform mastitis. The goal of the milk proteomics project is to identify biomarkers of inflammation that are specific to coliform mastitis in order to establish regulatory criteria for the evaluation of the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when used to treat inflammation associated with coliform mastitis. Additional proteomic analyses included in the CVM/OR 3 year plan include the characterization of antimicrobial peptide expression in bovine bronchial fluid during experimentally induced pneumonia, and the comparative analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of bacteria known to cause disease in food animals.</p>
<p><br />3.4 Technical Requirements <br />3.4.1 New instrument. The instrument shall be a newly manufactured unit, not used and refurbished, or previously used for demonstration. The life cycle for this instrument is intended to be &gt;10 years at full performance. CVM shall be able to reasonably expect service and technical support from the vendor during its life cycle.<br />3.4.2 Warranty and Preventative Maintenance. Entire system shall be warranted for parts and labor for 12 months from date of acceptance, including two preventative maintenance (PM) visits. The vendor shall also provide pricing for an optional extended warranty/maintenance agreement for additional years. However, this information shall not obligate CVM to purchase the extended warranty/maintenance agreement. The specific requirements for this optional service contract are: <br />3.4.2.1 Service contract coverage shall include trouble-shooting capabilities based on complete knowledge of the entire instrument, immediate access to certified replacement parts, and immediate access to improvements and new procedures provided by the original vendor and manufacturer. <br />3.4.2.2 Service shall be provided by service engineers who are trained and certified by the original manufacturer. Engineers shall have access to the manufacturer's latest technical developments, repair procedures, application updates, diagnostic software, and planned maintenance procedures. <br />3.4.2.3 The contract shall enable the Project Officer to have access to the manufacturer's call center for technical assistance, which is staffed by senior engineers to provide a high level of expertise for troubleshooting the instrument. <br />3.4.2.4 The vendor shall be able to guarantee that a service engineer will be able to work on site within two business days of receiving a call from DRC. <br />3.4.2.5 The vendor shall provide all travel, labor and parts at no additional charge. There shall be two scheduled maintenance visits over the term of the contract.</p>
<p>3.4.3 Installation. The vendor shall demonstrate upon installation that the item meets all performance specifications. The instrument shall not be accepted until those performance specifications have been met. Sufficient training shall be provided during the installation such that CVM operators may independently operate the instrument and increase familiarity and proficiency.<br />3.4.4 Training. The proposal shall include additional on-site multi-day training for up to four operators after the instrument has been accepted and CVM operators have become familiar with the system.</p>

The Statement of Work is attached as a part of this announcement.

Period of Performance shall be one year from date of contract award.

Evaluation Factors

Proposals received shall first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost. Those proposals considered technically acceptable shall then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall decision. All evaluation factors, other than cost/price, when considered, are significantly more important than cost or price. It is point out, however; should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, the cost or price shoud become primary.

Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Goverhnement. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Goverhment will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Governfment may become the ultimate determing factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on the other factors. This evaluation shall be based upon the completeness and thoroughnes of the proposal submitted. The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the request for proposal are understood and offer a logical consistent program for their achievement.

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offeror must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria attached to this announcment.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service), intends to award on a sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302 Other Than Full and Open Competition with The Florida State University for the Development of a Experimentally Operational Neural-Net Based Oil Spill Detection System.</p>
<p>The National Ocean Service (NOS) and other environmental users are concerned about oil in the marine environment because it is destructive to wildlife, recreational beaches and delicate coastal ecosystems and because its cleanup is difficult and costly. In support of such users, the NESDIS Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) intends to develop oil detections procedures/algorithms based primarily on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data.</p>
<p>Oil spill monitoring is needed under a number of scenarios including:<br />1. Oil releases from vessel groundings or sinkings<br />2. Oil spills, whether intentional or unintentional, from vessels underway (such as results from bilge pumping) or at anchor or docked<br />3. Oil spills/leaks from oil drilling or production platforms or underwater pipelines<br />4. Oil spills from shore or riverside facilities which make their way to the water</p>
<p>Several types of algorithms have been developed to use synthetic aperture radar satellite data to detect oil in the marine environment. Such algorithms/software include a neural network based approach that STAR has reviewed and found particularly promising.</p>
<p>However, mapping of oil in the marine environment has not been done successfully in a solely automated fashion. There are too many false positives when any one type of satellite remote sensing data is used; thus the most successful oil spill analysis techniques involve a human analyst and are interactive. Ideally an analyst with access to additional data/algorithms should interactively use an oil spill analysis technique such as a neural net algorithm as a tool and quality control its output to produce a useful oil spill map. Therefore the NESDIS Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB) will take the tools that NESDIS/STAR develops and use them to perform man-machine mix analyses of SAR and other data to detect marine oil. <br /><br />The purpose of the work covered by this request is to develop a working neural network system under the guidance of NESDIS/STAR that uses Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data to provide an automated outline of potential oil spill regions for further modification and quality control by human analysts in the NESDIS Satellite Analysis Branch. The resulting man-machine mix product will support users in NOS and other agencies. The software will be employed in an experimentally operational fashion and be extensively tested prior to modification for full operational production in the future.</p>
<p>Vendors who believe that they have the ability to develop the Experimentally Operational Neural-Net Based Oil Spill Detections System are required to submit in writing affirmative response demonstrating that they can meet the Government requirements to provide the required system. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit sufficient documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 10 days after this publication.</p>
<p>The POC is Shalisha Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 713 0838 x 197, email shalisha.harris@noaa.gov</p>
<p>Submit written questions to Shalisha Harris no later than July 7, 2010.</p>
<p>The closing date is July 13, 2010, 11a.m. local time</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.  This combined synopsis/solicitation SHALL be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/).  The RFQ number is N00189-10-T-0274.  This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-42 and DFARS Change Notice 2010-0623.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252201.htm.  This acquisition will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 454112 and the Small Business Standard is $25 M.  The Department of Navy (DON) is seeking commercially available web-based reverse auctioning services that allow the DON buyers to post specific requirements to obtain offers for commodities and services from different suppliers within the provider network maintained by the Reverse Auction Service Provider.    The goal is to reduce direct and indirect purchase costs and to capture detailed spend data.
Buyers shall have the ability to set a target price, specify that the winning price must be equal to or better than this target price, optionally set the criteria for selecting the winner (s), include DON terms and conditions, and set a specified start and end date of each auction.  Suppliers shall be able to submit a successively lower quote than the target price or leading quote to anonymously compete for a DON requirement.  Vendors shall not have knowledge of the identities of the other vendor's participating in auction.  At the end of the auction, the buyer shall have the option to select the winner(s) manually.  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Strategic Sourcing Division located at the Naval Station, Norfolk, VA requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing: 
Item 0001 - The contractor shall provide user-friendly web-enabled capabilities to purchase commodities through a reverse auction mechanism that does not require the download or installation of any software.   This requirement is being limited to Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Supply auctions.
The period of performance for the base year will be from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011.  There are also three option years to be made available at the government's discretion.
Item 0002 - Option Year 1 - October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012.Item 0003 - Option Year 1 - October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013. Item 0004 - Option Year 1 - October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014.
The web-enabled auctioning interface shall permit personnel to conduct real-time competed auctions for different contract vehicles by posting online reverse auction formatted solicitations, utilize best value award criteria, and establish auction start/end time.

Period of Performance: The period of performance for furnishing services is 12 months from date of the contract award, with three twelve month option periods, subject to the Government's needs and the availability of funds.  
NOTE: 	Using FAR 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures, all quotes will be evaluated for best value based on Technical Capabilities, Past Performance, and Price.   
	Prospective service providers shall provide an explanation of how their e-procurement system works, addressing each of the 20 factors stated above, and identify the transaction fees and other charges, if any, they may charge the vendors seeking to sell supplies to the Navy in response to a solicitation that uses the Reverse Auction Service Provider (RASP) online reverse auction e-procurement system.  
	The e-procurement system shall have the ability to incorporate and comply with all necessary clauses and provisions, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Buy American Act, Trade Agreements Act, and Appropriations Act restrictions as they apply to procurements of the Department of Defense.
	The prospective service providers shall also affirmatively acknowledge in writing that (1) they understand that funds are not and will not be available for this contract; (2) no legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment will ever arise from this contract; and (3) for any and all compensation for performing the services required by the terms of this contract, they shall rely entirely and exclusively on transaction fees and other charges, as set forth in the contract terms and conditions, charged to and collected from the vendors seeking to sell supplies to the Navy in response to a solicitation that uses the RASP's online reverse auction e-procurement system. 
	To evaluate technical capabilities, all those providing quotes are required to submit an 8  x 11" three-page narrative that describes a prior approach to meeting the Statement of Objectives requirements on a Reverse Auction Services initiative along with the overarching process that was involved in supporting a Reverse Auction e-procurement system on a previous Federal award service contract.  Ability to respond in short time frames, i.e. turnaround times, the amount of time it takes from receipt of requisition to the start of the reverse auction will be rated as Highly Acceptable (HA), Acceptable (A), or Unacceptable (U).  The inability to show the capability to include clauses related to the Buy American Act; Free Trade Act, and Appropriation Act restrictions into reverse auctions will be cause to deem quote technically unacceptable.  The RASP network will be rated as Highly Acceptable (HA), Acceptable (A), or Unacceptable (U.)
	Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Vendor to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation.  In addition to PPIRS, vendors are required to provide information including contract numbers, period of performance and point of contact (POC) information on no more than five (5) of the firm's most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed five (5) years since completion) for like or similar to the services being provided under this RFQ. Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Past performance will be rated as Highly Acceptable (HA), Acceptable (A), Neutral (N) or Unacceptable (U.)
	Vendors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.
	Price will be evaluated via proposed seller's fees.  The lowest seller's fee will be considered by the government to be the lowest price. 	Adjectival Rating	DescriptionHighly Acceptable (HA)	Quote meets and exceeds the requirements for an acceptable rating; a high probability of success in contract performance is demonstrated through some or all of the following: (1) the quote exceeds the solicitation requirements, and the excesses are beneficial to the Navy; (2) the quote offers innovations and/or creative approaches that are beneficial to the Navy; (3) the quote demonstrates a superior understanding of the solicitation requirements and/or; (4) the level of performance risk associated with the quote is substantially less than the level expected from a competent quoter.
Quote Demonstrates:  Superior accomplishment of contract requirements and very high customer satisfaction.  
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the quoter's performance record, very little doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort. Acceptable (A)	Quote meets all the requirements of the solicitation with no deficiencies or affirmative exceptions to the solicitation requirements.  A "deficiency" is a material failure of a quote to meet a solicitation requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a quote that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.  A "significant weakness" in the quote is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A good probability of success in contract performance is demonstrated as follows: (1) the quote reflects a satisfactory understanding of the solicitation requirements; and (2) the level of performance risk associated with the quote is no more than the level expected from a competent quoter.
Quote Demonstrates:  Fully compliant accomplishment of contract requirements and positive customer satisfaction.  
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the quoter's performance record, minimal (but perhaps some) doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort. Unacceptable (U)	Quote fails to meet requirements of the solicitation to the extent that one or more of the following conditions exists: (1) the quote contains deficiencies  and/or affirmative exceptions to the solicitation requirements that are so substantial that they could not be corrected (i.e., the revisions required to make the quote acceptable would be tantamount to an entirely new quote); (2) the quote demonstrates a general lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and/or; (3) the level of performance risk associated with the quote is so significant that it is unlikely the quote would result in satisfactory contract performance.
Quote Demonstrates:   Failure to properly accomplish contract requirements and failure to satisfy customer.  
Very High Performance Risk:  Based on the quoter's performance record, it appears unlikely the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.Neutral(Applies only to Past Performance Factors)	It is determined that the quoter has no relevant past performance.

(2)	NON-AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS:(a) Funds are not and will not be available for this contract.  Accordingly, this contract does not and shall not, under any circumstances, create or result in an obligation of funds from which payment from the government for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment will ever arise from this contract.   (b) For any and all compensation for performing the services required by the terms of this contract, the RASP shall rely entirely and exclusively on transaction fees and other charges, as set forth in the contract terms and conditions, charged to and collected from the vendors seeking to sell supplies to the Navy in response to a solicitation that uses the RASP's online reverse auction e-procurement system."(3)	Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This acquisition is for nanomechanical testing instrument (NTI) for use in advanced materials and mechanical engineering education and for research in the mechanical properties of materials at small length scales. This instrument measures the mechanical behavior of small volumes of materials in a number of modes: indentation, scratching, micropillar compression, and dynamic loading.  Advanced instruments also have the capability for high resolution imaging of the resulting surface damage and for automated control of ensembles of measurements.  This acquisition will also support the integration of nanomechanics into the educational programs in the science and engineering curricula at NPS as it is an instrument that can readily be used by students and that pairs well with solid mechanics curriculum of the MAE Department.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
1.	Scope. Acquisition and installation of two large screen monitors into the Marine Corps Air Station, New River Memorial Chapel, that can both be connected by USB or Coax cable to a single PC or other media outputs.  The screens need to be large enough to be easily seen and words read from the back pews. 
1.1	Background. The New River Air Station Memorial Chapel is used by every Squadron on station for training large groups, and we need to meet the multi-media needs.  The Chapel also wants to provide contemporary worship, to include words to songs, video, and other multi-media projects to enhance the worship experience.
2.	Tasks.  Install, wire, and set-up two large screen monitors for use as multi-media in the MCAS NR Memorial Chapel.
2.1	General Requirements.  The monitors need to be able to be hooked up by USB to our laptop, so we can run programs, slide, and video on the monitors.  We need both monitors to show the same thing at the same time, so we need the ability to hook them up individually as well as both on a single USB.  We also need to have the ability to do the same thing using Coax cable, so we can run them individually or together off a DVD player.  The monitors need to be hooked up to our Sound System so we can hear what is on the screen.  We want them mounted on the wood panels above the entrance doors on each side of the sanctuary stage - with a possible slight angle inboard.  
2.2	Contractor Services.  Acquire, deliver, and install the two monitors, install wires and hook them up to our sound system.

REVISED
STATEMENT OF WORK
VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA)
Workshop on Financial Policies and Procedures for VA affiliated 
Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations (NPCs)


Project description/scope of work:
 VHA is seeking to conduct a comprehensive workshop on financial policies and procedures to ensure sound financial management and effective internal controls among the 84 VA-affiliated nonprofit research and education corporations (NPCs).  In 1988, Congress authorized VA medical centers to establish NPCs to administer non-VA federal and private sector funds provided in support of research and education performed at VA medical centers.  According to their most recent reports to VA, for 2008 the NPCs collectively had revenues of approximately $249 million and net assets of approximately $206 million. 

The May 5, 2008, OIG report on five NPCs and on VHA oversight of the NPCs contained the following findings:  "NPCs did not have adequate controls to manage funds" and "NPCs did not adequately segregate financial duties."  The workshop described in this statement of work will increase NPC awareness of the OIG findings and will provide tools to improve NPC financial management.  Offering this training will also fulfill one component of VHA's commitment to improve NPC oversight.

The target audience is the NPC management team (i.e., executive director and senior financial personnel) and the Board Treasurer of the VA NPCs.  This will be an invitation only event for a limited number of the target audience.  Expected attendance will be 99 people.

The program will provide a minimum of 10 hours of training for attendees.

The goal of the training is to:

1.	Provide an overview on rationale for written financial policies and procedures and how to write effective ones; e.g., the elements of effective financial policies and procedures.

2.	Provide NPCs with specific examples of policies and procedures needed for financial reporting to the board of directors, comparative financial statements, budgeting, accrual accounting, revenue accounting, expense accounting, and internal controls.

3.	Provide NPCs with examples of financial policies and procedures specific to staff size: NPCs with 1-2 administrative staff members and low revenues; those with 2-4 staff members and mid-range revenues; and those with large staffs (4 or more) and high revenues; targeting just two groups rather than three will be a possibility.

4.	Provide an overview of federal and non-federal medical research grants and contracts, as well as, sub-awards and subcontracts.  Contractor will obtain examples of financial statements regarding these varied funding mechanisms.  Contractor will review the examples and improve upon them wherever possible.  The examples approved by VA will then be made available to the workshop participants and other users. 

5.	Contractor will obtain model policies and procedures from VA that meet standards applicable to nonprofits that administer federal awards and contracts such as 2 CFR 215.  Contractor will review the model policies and improve upon them wherever possible.  The model policies and procedures approved by VA will then be made available to the workshop participants and other users.

6.	Incorporate practical guidance on policies and procedures consistent with the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework for effective  internal controls and practical guidance on policies and procedures consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) publication "Managing the Business Risk of Fraud; A Practical Guide" to guard against fraud. 

7.	Develop a Training Manual and related Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and handouts for use within VA and its affiliated NPCs.  These materials will be delivered to the VA for unrestricted use by VA NPCs and any other organization the VA deems necessary without any further compensation due to the Contractor. 

8.	Provide useful checklists, forms, etc. to facilitate prompt application of the workshop content to NPC activities and financial management.  This training is being provided as one of the responses to VAOIG-07-00564-121 "Audit of Veterans Health Administration's Oversight of Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations."  Findings are detailed later in this Statement of Work.

a. "We recommended that the Under Secretary for Health strengthen NPPO procedures for following up on recommendations in independent audit reports on NPC financial statements and reviewing NPC submissions for the annual report to Congress." 

b.  "We recommended that the Under Secretary for Health revise VHA Handbook 1200.17 to clearly define minimum control requirements for all NPCs and provide training to NPC Directors on these requirements." 

c.  "We recommended that the Under Secretary for Health develop and implement oversight procedures to perform substantive reviews of NPC financial and management controls to ensure NPCs fully comply with Federal laws, VHA policies, and control standards." 

d.  "We recommended that the Under Secretary for Health develop and implement procedures to review, monitor, and enforce NPC compliance with conflict of interest laws and policies." 

II. Pedagogical approaches

"	The workshop presentations should be interactive, dynamic, energetic, interesting and captivating for the participants.

"	The workshop will be developed and conducted by the Contractor and will include a minimum of two contractor associates engaged to participate in developing and presenting the workshop content.  If agreed to by Contractor, the VA may elect to provide one or more of the associates from VA staff.

"	As appropriate and as the schedule allows, time will be allotted during the program for workshop participants to tailor the sample policies and procedures to meet their own needs so each NPC leaves the workshop with a start on policies and procedures that meet their own needs and that conform to VA requirements.

Following is a suggested workshop schedule for use as a starting point for further discussion:  

First Day:
8:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.	Workshop	General session
10:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.	Break	
10:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon	Workshop	General or breakout sessions
12:00 noon - 1:30 p.m.	Lunch	
1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.	Workshop	General or breakout sessions
3:00 p.m. - 3:30 p.m.	Afternoon Break	
3:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.	Workshop	General or breakout sessions

Second Day:
8:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.	Workshop begins	General or breakout session
10:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.	Break	
10:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon	Workshop	General or breakout sessions
12:00 noon	Workshop concludes	

"	Workshop Structure:  It is suggested that time be allotted during the morning of the first day for a general session.  This time will be used to provide general information on how to write effective policies and procedures as well as additional information that will be useful to all attendees.  Whether and/or when to break up into two or three smaller groups, according to NPC staff size and revenue levels, will be determined jointly by VA and the Contractor as the workshop content is developed.

"	Workshop Training Manual, PowerPoint Presentation, and Handouts:  Contractor will deliver to VA comprehensive conference materials in accordance with the schedule described below under Development Process/Tasks.  Workshop materials provided will be a Training Manual and a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, as well as, supplemental materials to be used as training tools, and "take homes" such as checklists, sample policies and procedures, sample financial statements, etc. 

A significant portion of the effort required in order to develop the content of the workshop and the handouts, as well as, work required to collect information about the NPCs, such as, conference calls and one or more visits, will be performed during  the three months prior to the workshop.  More specifically, half hour calls between VA and consultant will be scheduled each week for the three months prior to the workshop.

Contractor will submit drafts of all of the foregoing materials to VA at least one month prior to the workshop.  A one day meeting will be held in Kansas City, Missouri or Washington, DC  two or three weeks prior to the workshop with the Contractor to discuss the drafts.
 
"	Take Homes.  Training Manual and Handouts tailored specifically to the VA NPCs will include "take homes" such as checklists, sample policies and procedures, model documentation (such as model financial statements and an annual NPC administrative budget), etc., that the NPC can utilize immediately after the workshop.  Take homes for this workshop will be directed toward NPC executive directors and senior financial staff. 


III. Development Process/Tasks (see V. Performance Measures section below)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Addendum: Basis for Award: This is a competitive best value acquisition. The Government will make an award using the following factors: 1) Technical Capability: Offerors shall provide written evidence of capability to perform the work required by the attached Performance Work Statement. Technical capability shall not exceed 5 pages. 2) Past Performance: Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers. The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager. Relevancy: Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. Past Performance information shall not exceed 5 pages. The Government will make an award to the Offeror that demonstrates the technical capability and past performance to complete the requirement. Technical capability and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price. 3) Price: Offers shall propose on all items. Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated. Any offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will NOT be accepted. Quotes determined to be unreasonable or incompatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will NOT be considered. 4. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror does not demonstrate the technical capability and past performance to complete the requirement. The Government also intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The resultant single award shall be placed with the offeror that represents the best value to the Government. A firm-fixed price award will be made to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the Government. Interested parties capable of providing the requirement MUST submit a written quote to include their tax identification number (TIN), CAGE code, DUNS, firm evidence of their ability to perform, and any discount terms. Oral quotes will not be accepted. All responses that meet the criteria contained within will be considered. To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ/solicitation, as prescribed in DFARS 252.204-7004 Alternate A, the contractor must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; NO EXCEPTIONS. To register, you may call 1-888-227-2423 or apply via the Internet at http://www.bpn.gov. The CCR registration must be completed before award can be made. Contractor must also complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca; NO EXCEPTIONS. All responsible sources may submit a quote.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-10-1068201-02.</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. (iv) This requirement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541519 and the small business size standard is $25M. The Government intends to issue a time and material / Labor Hour Contract for a base plus two option years.

<p>(v) &amp; (vi): GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is seeking qualified sources capable of Internet Monitoring and Analysis Support Services (IMSS). Please see the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and Other Terms and Conditions document for more details on this requirement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors -Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709. Offerors are required to submit their proposals in three separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>Volume 1 - Technical</p>
<p>Shall include supporting documentation as attachments to the technical volume, such as resumes, project management plan, Conflict of Interest Plan, and certifications. This volume shall contain the Technical Approach and not be a reiteration of the SOW. This portion of the proposal shall exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of each offer. Offerors shall demonstrate in sufficient detail a technical approach that will meet the requirements specified in the SOW (attachment #1). The technical volume shall not exceed 25 pages and be submitted electronically in PDF format. The page limitation does not include Cover page, Table of Contents, Resumes, Certifications, Project Management plan, or Conflict of Interest Plan.</p>
<p>Volume 2- Past Performance</p>
<p>This volume shall describe the Offeror's success in performing comparable contracts/orders. The Past Performance Volume shall be no more than three pages, i.e., no more than one page narrative per contract/order and submitted electronically in PDF format. The Offeror shall submit directly to the Government:</p>
<p>A list of three contracts/orders, similar in scope, duration, and price to the work described in the SOW. The Offeror shall adhere to the following guidelines in generating this list:</p>
<p>o Contracts or orders must have been completed within three years of the quote due date. <br />o The list may include contracts/orders on which the Offeror served as a subcontractor, provided that the subcontract was similar in scope, duration, and price to this effort.<br />o The list should include both a contractual and technical point of contact (email addresses and phone numbers) for each of the contracts/orders. <br />o If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. <br />o The list should include the contract/order number, title (if appropriate), the period of performance, and the dollar value of the contract/order. <br />o If the contract/order is not described in the Technical Volume, the Offeror shall include a one page narrative the contract/order, describing the nature of the work performed and emphasizing outcomes reached.</p>
<p>The Offeror should also send the Past Performance Questionnaire attached to the RFP (Attachment 2) to the sources that it identifies in the Past Performance Volume. The questionnaires should be sent to the individual most knowledgeable about the Offeror's performance on the identified order or program (e.g. the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; the Program/Project Manager; or the Contracting Officer). Each reference must complete the questionnaire and mail a hard copy to the Contract Specialist. The Offeror may opt to allow the return of completed questionnaires to the Government via electronic mail. This is solely at the discretion of the Offeror, with the understanding that e-mail systems, servers, Internet, intranets and extranets are not considered secure. The Offeror shall ensure that all the point of contacts complete and return the questionnaires to the Government prior to the RFP close date. Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided by each Offeror as well as data obtained from possible other sources such as the Nation Institute of Health's (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS) or the Department of Defense's (DOD) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRs) in the evaluation of past performance.<br />Government:</p>
<p>Volume 3 - Pricing Proposal</p>
<p>The completion and submission of the above items will constitute an offer (proposal) and will indicate the offeror's unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this RFP and any attachments hereto. Alternate proposals are not authorized. Objections to any terms and conditions of the RFP will constitute deficiency, which may render the offer unacceptable. This volume shall include proposed labor categories, labor rates (fully-loaded), level-of-effort, and materials / Other Direct Costs / and Travel (if applicable) for a base plus 2 option periods. The pricing proposal shall be submitted on the attached Microsoft Excel Sheet (Attachment 3) with the cells unlocked.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals and are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 Technical Proposal</p>
<p>FACTOR 1) Technical Understanding: The proposed content will be evaluated on the ability to demonstrate that the offeror understands the technical requirements and has a coherent, feasible and efficient approach to providing the services required.</p>
<p>The proposal shall:</p>
<p>a) demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as stated in the SOW; <br />b) specify the contractor's current infrastructure for internet monitoring and analysis support services to include any (if applicable) Commercial Off the Shelf (COTs), Government off the Shelf (GOTs), or contractor proprietary software; <br />c) present an approach to monitoring FDA Regulated Products and tracking affiliated networks; <br />d) presents an approach to reporting and notifying the FDA; <br />e) delineate a detailed and well organized project plan and staffing plan that demonstrates all aspects of the services to be performed</p>
<p>FACTOR 2) Relevant Experience</p>
<p>This section of the technical proposal shall include a written narrative describing two to four projects that are similar to this effort in terms of scope, complexity, importance to the agency's mission, and size. The proposed projects that are included in the narrative should involve internet monitoring. Projects listed may include contracts with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers. The narrative shall emphasize any situations in which the Offeror conducted internet monitoring, tracked affiliated networks, and monitored regulated products, such as pharmaceuticals, bilogics, vaccines, medical devices etc...</p>
<p>The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical apprach minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical approach fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technical approach exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement.</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Past Performance: The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that bidder's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the bidder as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.</p>
<p>VOLUME 3: PRICE</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a 12 month base period plus two 12 month option periods. Price is less important than technical and past performance. As proposals are rated more equal technically pricing will prevail. The FDA will evaluate the proposed labor rates and bottom-line price by making a price reasonableness determination. FDA will determine price reasonableness by utilizing one or several of the following price realism techniques: reviewing the proposed ceiling amount and labor rates against amounts and rates previously paid by the FDA for similar work, amounts previously charged by the contractor for similar work, standard market labor rates for similar labor categories, and determining whether the overall proposed level of effort / labor mix reflects the contractor's proposed technical approach and meets the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work. If applicable FDA reserves the right to review the contractor's labor rates on the General Service Administration (GSA) (if applicable) website and seek price information from other commercial and Government sources. Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor's online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete. If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY Section 508 Standards This contract qualifies for an exception to Section 508. As such, Section 508 standards requirements will not apply. (xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition. (xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (APR 2010), applies to this acquisition (See clauses in attachment #1)</p>
<p>(xvi &amp; xvii) All questions must be submitted in writing to Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than Wednesday June 9, 2010. Answers to all questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation prior to proposal due date. Proposals must be submitted electronically to Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than Thursday, July 1, 2010 at 2pm ET.</p>

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.<br />(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:<br />Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting &lsquo;more than 50 percent' for &lsquo;at least 80 percent' each place it appears.<br />Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<br />Inverted Domestic Corporation.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:<br />_it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73; <br />_it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74, which has not been denied; or <br />_it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.<br />(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.<br />(End of provision)<br />3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict Of Interest (Jun 2006)<br />(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting are illustrated by the following examples and restrictions. <br />(1) The examples are not all inclusive, but will be used by the Contracting Officer to apply general guidance to individual contract situations: <br />(a) Unequal access to information. Access to "nonpublic information" as part of the performance of a DHS contract could provide the contractor a competitive advantage in a later competition for another DHS contract. Such an advantage could easily be perceived as unfair by a competing vendor who is not given similar access to the relevant information. If the requirements of the DHS procurement anticipate the successful vendor may have access to nonpublic information, the successful vendor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan. Alternatively, the "nonpublic information" may be provided to all vendors.<br />(b) Biased ground rules. A contractor in the course of performance of a DHS contract, has in some fashion established important "ground rules" for another DHS contract, where the same contractor may be a competitor. For example, a contractor may have drafted the statement of work, specifications, or evaluation criteria of a future DHS procurement. The primary concern of the DHS in this case is that a contractor so situated could slant key aspects of a procurement in its own favor, to the unfair disadvantage of competing vendors. If the requirements of the DHS procurement anticipate the contractor may have been in a position to establish important ground rules, including but not limited to those described herein, the contractor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.<br />(c) Impaired objectivity. A contractor in the course of performance of a DHS contract, is placed in a situation of providing assessment and evaluation findings over itself, or another business division, or subsidiary of the same corporation, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship. The concern in this case is that the contractor's ability to render impartial advice to the DHS could appear to be undermined by the contractor's financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed or evaluated. In these situations, a "walling off" of lines of communication may well be insufficient to remove the perception that the objectivity of the contractor has been tainted. If the requirements of the DHS procurement indicate that the successful vendor may be in a position to provide evaluations and assessments of itself or corporate siblings, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship, the affected contractor should provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the vendor from the affected contract work. Such recusal might include divestiture of the work to a third party vendor.<br />(2) In order to prevent a future OCI resulting from potential bias, unfair competitive advantage, or impaired objectivity, the Contractor shall be subject to the following restrictions:<br />(a) The Contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any government contracts as to which, in the course of performance of this contract, the Contractor has received advance procurement information before such information has been made generally available to other persons or firms.<br />(b) The Contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any government contract for which the contractor actually assists in the development of specifications or statements of work.<br />(c) The Contractor shall be excluded competition for or award of any government contract which calls for the evaluation of system requirements, system definitions, or other products developed by the Contractor under this contract.<br />(d) The Contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any government contract which calls for the construction or fabrication of any system, equipment, hardware, and/or software for which the Contractor participated in the development of requirements or definitions pursuant to this contract.<br />(3) This clause shall not exclude the Contractor from performing work under any amendment or modification to this contract or from competing for award for any future contract for work that is the same or similar to work performed under this contract.<br />(4) The term "contractor" as used in this clause, includes any person, firm or corporation which has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor or in any parent corporation thereof, any person, firm, or corporation in or as to which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest. The term also includes the corporate officers of the contractor, those of any corporation which has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor, and those of any corporation in which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest.<br />(5) The agency may in its sole discretion, waive any provisions of this clause if deemed in the best interest of the Government. The exclusions contained in this clause shall apply for the duration of this contract and for three (3) years after completion and acceptance of all work performed hereunder.<br />(6) If any provision of this clause excludes the Contractor from competition for, or award of any contract, the Contractor shall not be permitted to serve as a subcontractor, at any tier, on such contract. <br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />_(1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />_(2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.<br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>This is a modification to address all Q&A's.

Questions in response to Solicitation No. 10PS18379 (DCAA) for GAGAS Subject Matter Expert
1. Nature of relationship - Some of the specific tasks in the work statement (item 3 on page II-1 to II-3) require the contractor to perform what appear to be inherently governmental functions. For example, representing the Agency's position (item 3.1.9), supporting the Agency's representatives in dealing with GAO and DODIG (item 3.1.8), being an Agency expert and providing guidance on Agency policies (item 3.1.1), serving as a focal point (item 3.1.2), ensuring various outcomes (item 3.1.5) and perhaps other specific tasks. Please clarify whether the contractor's role is limited to providing expert advice on GAGAS-related issues or whether something more is anticipated.
Answer:  The requirements are for GAGAS Subject Matter Expert to assist and advise the DCAA in support of GAGAS.
Also, please indicate the process the Agency will use to request advice from the contractor and to accept or reject that advice. Will the Agency have employees in place who will take over the contractor's role in the future? Is the contractor expected to train these employees? 
Answer:  The project manager will provide a specific tasking in accordance with the statement of work, outlining the task objective and deliverable and expected completion date.  If the tasking is requesting advice on a subject matter, it will be the Agency's decision as to whether to accept the advice. The Agency's decision to not accept the contractor's advice does not necessarily mean the product was in error.  If the tasking objective is not completed with the expected deliverable, the product will be rejected.  There has been no decision on whether to replace the contractor employee with a government employee in the future.
2. Level of effort - Since the solicitation does not indicate the number or details of the specific reports, position papers and memoranda that will be requested as deliverables, it is difficult to determine the level of effort required for this solicitation. To perform all of the specific tasks listed in Section 3.1 would appear to require several full time employees. Is the contractor expected to perform each of these specific tasks, or are they examples of some of the things contractor might be asked to do? Since the contractor has limited time, will DCAA consider a proposal that provides a specific number of hours but does not necessarily achieve the objectives of all the specific tasks? Since the level of effort is vague, will it be adequate to quote only an hourly rate, without quoting total dollars? 
Answer:  Hours of Operation:  The contractor is responsible for conducting business, between the hours of  9:00AM - 6:00 PM, approximately 25 hours per week, Monday thru Friday except Federal holidays or when the Government facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings, or similar Government directed facility closings.  
3. Performance Thresholds - Section 4.3 indicates that products shall be 98% error-free. What does this mean when the contractor is requested to provide advice using professional judgment and where the Agency has the responsibility to accept or reject that advice? Please confirm that the Agency's decision to not accept the contractor's advice does not mean the product is in error. 
Answer:  The Agency's decision to not accept the contractor's advice does not necessarily mean the product was in error and/or would be rejected.  The DCAA program manager will provide a specific tasking in accordance with the statement of work, outlining the task objective and deliverable and expected completion date.  If the tasking objective is not completed with the expected deliverable, the product will be rejected. If the objective is completed with the expected deliverable, the product will be accepted.  However, whether to accept the advice of the contractor is a management decision. 
4. Security Requirements - Can the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF85P) be completed after the contract is awarded, or does it have to be completed and attached to the response to the solicitation? Is work on sensitive Automated Information Systems anticipated? 
Answer:  Please see Section 6 (Security Requirements) of Section II Addendum.  Once the contract is awarded DCAA will follow up and request the required security paperwork.  Yes, the contractor will be required to work on DCAA's sensitive Automated Information Systems with access to the DCAA network.
5. Telework - Is telework permitted under this contract? May contractor use his own computer to work on this contract? Are there security or other requirements that must be met for the contractor to use his own computer? 
Answer:  Please see Section III  (Place of Performance) of Solicitation.  Work at other than the place of performance may be approved on a case by case basis.  For Official Use Only (FOUO) information can only be stored on government computers.  The contractor will  not be allowed to use his personal computer for performing DCAA effort.  Contractor will be provided a government computer for performance of his task.
6. Travel - Since the specific tasks require providing advice on specific situations, please clarify how much travel is anticipated. Is travel time chargeable to the contract?
Answer:  Travel is estimated at 6 trips per year.  Travel time is chargeable to labor hours line item and travel expenses to travel line item.

Task 091-R is a research and development effort sponsored by NASAs AeronauticsResearch Mission Directorate and the Airspace Systems Program. Research funded by this task entitled, Efficient Descent Advisor for 3D-Path ArrivalManagement (3D-PAM) will focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing the USnational airspace. It is forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in the UnitedStates will double, far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely flyaircraft. To handle this growth, NASA is contributing toward the development of the NextGeneration Air Transportation System (NextGen).This task supports the development and testing of air traffic control automation toenable fuel-efficient arrival operations during all traffic conditions, particularlyduring busy air traffic conditions where demand exceeds available airspace or airportcapacity. The operations enabled by the Efficient Descent Advisor (EDA) are characterizedby continuous aircraft descents at low engine power. Further enhancements to EDA are alsoexpected to reduce controller and pilot workload by minimizing the number of air trafficcontrol communications required in the arrival domain. This technology is being developedas a key capability for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). EDA isan existing software-based, decision-support tool intended for use by controllers workingin FAA en route air traffic control facilities. EDA generates speed, altitude and routeadvisories to allow airplanes to fly arrival trajectories that minimize fuel burn andenvironmental emissions, while keeping them safely separated from other traffic and incompliance with capacity constraints. Under this task, the existing EDA software will beexpanded to incorporate a concept called 3D-Path Arrival Management (or 3D-PAM).This award notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The task order was issued under anexisting Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract, NAS2-03144, which was made on a competitive basis.Due to the variability of this research and development work, a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee taskorder was determined appropriate.

<DESC>RECOVERY: ARRA provided $17.8 million in grant funding to the states for youth activities, including summer employment for youth.  States and local areas were encouraged to use a significant portion of these funds to operate summer youth employment opportunities during the summer (from May 1  September 30) of 2009, as well as to provide as many youth as possible with summer employment opportunities and other work experiences outside of the summer months.  ARRA also raised the age criterion for eligibility for youth programs from 21 to 24 years old.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already working in the area renovating the boat ramp and clearing debris.    2) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during the work.  A detailed scope of work has not been prepared.   3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the other ongoing work without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the area is closed thus minimizing the impact on the public.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>Justification and Approval 
Use Other Than Full and Open Competition
PROJECT: Replace Dialysis Water System 
Fargo VAMC, Fargo, North Dakota
Based on the following justification, I hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to Public Law (PL) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which is codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128 and, specifically, VAAR 819.7007 which allows for a sole source acquisition to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  FAR 6.302-5(a)(2)(i) is also applicable and provides that, (2) Full and open competition need not be provided for when (i) A statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source
1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Agency

Contracting Office U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Fargo, North Dakota.

2.	Nature and/or Description of Action

Approval is requested to use other than full and open competition for a design-build construction project in support of the Fargo VAMC.  The project includes the design and construction of a new Dialysis Water System.  The Fargo VA Contracting Office is proposing a sole source to a Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business, 3ND Inc of Fargo, ND.

History of this Requirement: None

3.	Description of Supplies or Services

The Fargo VAMC requires the design and construction of a new dialysis water system to support existing in-patient dialysis needs and future out-patient needs.  The project has a government estimate of $239,983.75 and the estimated performance period of 180 days.

4.	Identification of Statutory Authority
FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute. This requirement is being set aside under Public Law (PL) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which is codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128 and, specifically, VAAR 819.7007  (Dec 2009) which allows for a sole source acquisition to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  As delineated in the VAAR 819.7007 and pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source awards) for contracts to SDVOSBs and [Veteran-Owned Small Businesses] VOSBs where the anticipated award price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Procedures threshold but not to exceed $5,000,000.  Each related award must be made to a responsible SDVOSB or VOSB at a fair and reasonable price as determined by the contracting officer.  Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written justifications and approvals in accordance with FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute. Synopsis is not required per FAR 5.202(a)(4).
5.	Demonstration of contractors unique qualifications or nature of acquisition requires use of the authority cited

The Fargo VAMC normally solicits all construction requirements competitively through SDVOSB set asides.  In this instance the funding for the requirement did not become available until mid January.  The only method available to ensure award of the contract no later than June 30, 2010 is the use of the cited authority.

6.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Costs

The contractors proposal will be compared with a detailed government estimate which was provided by Facility Engineering.  The contracting officer will be able to determine the cost fair and reasonable through a combination of cost/price analysis techniques during negotiations.

7.	Efforts to Obtain Competition

None

8.	Description of Market Research

3ND Inc has a history of providing outstanding construction service to the Fargo VAMC and was selected for this requirement as they have the both a qualified engineering partnership and the ability to complete the construction phase of the contract satisfactorily.

9.	Other Supporting Facts

10.	Interested Sources

Not Applicable-- Synopsis is not required per FAR 5.202(a)(4)

11.	Statement of Action for Barriers to Competition None

 
12.	Contracting & Technical Personnel Certification

I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Therefore, I approve this procurement under other than full and open competition bases.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VAPSHCS. 

2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a Dermatome set manufactured by Zimmer.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  
Zimmer Electric Dermatome Set includes: Handpiece-4 width plates-power supply-autoclave tray-screwdriver.

4.  Statutory Authority:  
	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	( x)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: Other vendors were considered and this is the only one that works, educated on and cross service compatible. This is to replace exsiting equipment that was taken out of service.  

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  
Potential vendors will be contacted for verbal quotes.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:   
In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2), price will be determined fair and reasonable with a previous contract award of the dermatome set.

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  
The Mandatory Federal Supply Schedules lists at least two other vendors who might be able to participate.  The vendors are: Advanced Surgical Services V797P-4008B and Princeton Medical Group, Inc. V797P-4117B.



9.  Other Considerations:  All staff in the operating room and in sterile processing have been trained and are confident with the use of the Zimmer equipment.  To bring in another product from another company would affect patient care and delay their surgical case.

10.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
