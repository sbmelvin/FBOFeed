<DESC>Pre Solicitation -- Notice / Procurement       #1406-04-07-RP-66155 License Plate Reader System for CBP/DHS The Department of Interior (DOI), GovWorks National Business Center (NBC) in conjunction with The U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has a requirement for a License Plate Reader (LPR) system that enables accurate, automated real-time queries of license plate information.  This requirement is being issued as full and open in accordance FAR Part 15 for competitive acquisitions.  This pre-solicitation notice does not require a response; its purpose is only to notify industry that a full RFP will be posted within the coming weeks, the Government estimates March 29, 2007 as the official release date.  Once the official RFP has been released Offerors will have forty-five days to prepare and submit there response.  Please note this requirement is subject to the availability of funds.  GovWorks does not intend to pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this announcement or for RFP submissions.  Those interested parties that want to be qualified as a small business must certify their qualification under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334519 (size standard - $500M) "Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing" in their RFP submission.  Offerors must be registered in CCR at the time of proposal submission to be deemed responsive.   The Government anticipates an award of a hybrid type contract- a multiyear Firm-Fixed-Price Service Contract with Time and Material Construction elements.  The period of performance for this contract shall be for a period of one base year and four one (1) year option periods beginning with the date of award.  The evaluation of the responses in order to determine source selection will occur in a three-tiered phase: 1) submission of technical & cost proposals, 2) oral presentations and 3) a live solution demonstration.   BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has the responsibility to defend the United States (U.S.) borders against the entry of terrorists and terrorist weapons, illegal aliens, narcotics and other threats to our country, while expediting passage for legitimate travelers and trade. The CBP employs a layered enforcement strategy to accomplish this mission, which includes the use of a wide range of technology to target and detect threats to border security. One such technology is the License Plate Reader (LPR) system that enables accurate, automated real-time queries of license plate information to TECS.  The LPRs ensure that all passenger vehicles crossing the U.S. land borders have their license plates automatically queried against TECS (and a number of other law enforcement databases), allowing the CBP Officer in the primary lane to focus their attention fully on traffic and any possible threats to security and safety. PURPOSE:   The LPRs currently used by CBP are approaching the end of their useful life cycle and CBP has a need to procure a new COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) LPR system that will be able to read and transmit license plate data, including state/province of origin for all types of vehicular traffic, to TECS at a high rate of accuracy; accurately count vehicles passing through lanes with installed LPRs; and perform other specific functions, as outlined in this Statement of Work (SOW), including the ability to save license plate/vehicle images from the LPRs to a searchable database. Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted via email to david.mitchell@mms.gov.  Please include with your questions your full name, reference number 1406-04-07-RP-66155, email subject line "LPR," your organization's name, complete address, phone number and email address.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS PURSUANT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.  THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODES THAT THIS WORK WILL FALL UNDER ARE 236220 and 238110.  The Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) is contemplating the award of up to six Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to Contractors having experience with design/build and performance-based contracts, and with past experience with Department of Defense (DoD) or other Government healthcare facilities, to perform as prime contractors on various Structural Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects at DoD medical treatment facilities worldwide.  Approximately 10 to 15% of the projects may require performance in non-hostile Outside the continental United States (OCONUS) and/or foreign locations including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, as well as OCONUS locations such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Great Britain.  These projects are being procured by the DVA for the Air Force, or other potential DoD agencies, under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8111.  In general, the MAC contracted efforts will consist of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform the above SRM services for DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF).  Anticipated requirements include one-time repair and renovation of building interiors and exteriors within medical facilities to include roof repair and/or replacement, building envelope repairs (siding, stucco, windows), foundation, and other renovations.  In addition, task orders may include efforts classified as construction requirements incidental to SRM needs (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).  Medical facilities may be of any configuration or state of repair depending on age and location.  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility with an active inpatient population.  Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but potential offerors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from security to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.  The Government contemplates awards of three or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.  The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is estimated at $150,000,000.00 over five years. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally.  Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process.  SPECIAL NOTE:  One MAC contractor will be issued an initial task order based on competitively evaluated award of a seed project included in the MAC solicitation.  This seed project within this MAC solicitation is at the 51st Medical Group Hospital located at Osan Air Base Japan.  This 101,215 Sq Ft facility was constructed in 1988.  The roof encompasses approximately 34,000 sf.  This effort will entail: 1) Removal and proper disposal of the existing roofing assemblies to the deck, 2) Replace with a high performance modified bitumen BUR with cold adhesive and new insulation with a 30 year NDL warranty, 3) Various minor repairs to existing wall and window assemblies. The estimated value of this effort is between $750,000 and $1,250,000. Performance and payment bonds will be required on this task order in an undetermined percentage, and also in a majority of other task orders issued under this MAC award.  Offerors must possess the bonding capabilities and sufficient resources required by the scope of this contract in order to be favorably considered.  This requirement is being procured through the Joint Venture Acquisition Center, Austin, TX.  Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 15 March 2007.  Contracting Officer for this anticipated contract is Ray Blomquist.  Contract Specialist is Jay L. Hawkins.  Questions specific to this solicitation may be answered by sending an email request to jay.hawkins@brooks.af.mil.  There is no cost for this solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer.  Telephone and fax requests are discouraged.  The Government will try to respond to all questions, however, response may not be furnished to questions received late in the solicitation period (less than 10 days prior to the proposal due date).  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively set to be held at Brooks City Base, San Antonio, Texas on March 29, 2007.  Exact time and location is pending and will be included in the solicitation and posted on this web site.  The purpose of the conference is to familiarize the offerors with the MAC and seed project scope of work, address questions concerning the basic contract awards and initial seed project, and familiarize offerors with the Best Value evaluation and award process.  Attendance at the conference is strongly encouraged.  Notes from the pre-proposal conference will be prepared by the Government and placed on this website as an amendment or additional notice.  The DVA cannot assume responsibility for any verbal or written assurances or representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of the contract, unless included by the Contracting Officer in the Request for Proposals, the specifications, or related documents.  All potential offerors must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award.  This office is not responsible for providing you with notifications of any changes to this solicitation.  The solicitation will be available only as a direct download and not be issued on CD-ROM.  It is the offerors responsibility to check this web site for issuance of the solicitation and for any posted changes or amendments to this solicitation. The plans, specifications, and all notifications of changes to this solicitation will only be made available through FedBizOpps (FBO).

Western believes Hughes items requested are the specific type of equipment that is compatible with and is necessary for maintenance and upgrade of our existing transmission lines. The quality of this hardware far exceeds expectations of other brand names that we have tried in past years. It is the strong desire to maintain standard tools and spare parts that are consistent with the line hardware that we currently have in stock. Other brands would increase our inventories and require different types of tools and equipment required for installation. Although the brand name is  being specified, there is adequate price competition available from distributors of these items. ALL RESPONSES TO THIS RFQ MAY BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY, FAXED TO 701-221-4526 OR MAILED TO WESTERN AREA POWER ADMINISTRATION, P.O. BOX 1173, BISMARCK, N.D. 58502 ATTN: CARMEN J. WIEDMEIER.

P/N 9547-15885.  12 ea MA210R.  10 ea 48/125V DC Power Supplies .  Western has standardization on RFL IMUX 2000 channels banks. Since channel bank expansion modules and adapters are being purchased to go into an existing channel bank, they must all obey the same protocol and have the same physical and electrical form-factors; however, each manufacturer utilizes their own, proprietary protocols and designs. Consequently, other manufacturers' equipment will not work in an existing IMUX channel bank and their systems will not communicate with an IMUX channel bank. All the items are RFL IMUX 2000 specific in order to maintain this compatibility with Western's existing RFL IMUX 2000 installations.  Western believes RFL Electronics is the only known manufacturer that has the proprietary information to provide these mux parts. The solicitation is set aside 100% for Small Business Concerns.  The NAICS Code is 334220 and the applicable size standard is 750 Employees.  The solicitation (Request for Quotes) will be issued electronically on or about March 15, 2007. Quotes may be faxed, mailed, e-mailed, or submitted electronically. Contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be considered for award.  Contractors may register at www.ccr.gov.  DUNS number is required for CCR registration.  Contractorâ€™s CCR registration must include the NAICS code specified above and Contractor must meet the size standard applicable to the NAICS.

<SOLNBR>DOL079RQ20334

<CONTACT>Jennifer Snook, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-693-4585, Fax 202-693-7290, Email snook.jennifer@dol.gov
<DESC>The Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Information Technology Center intends to issue a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with Microsoft to provide routine software maintenance and upgrades to mandated office products through an authorized Microsoft reseller.  DOL requires specific Microsoft Software leases under either a Core CAL or Enterprise CAL agreement.  DOL is heavily entrenched in Microsoft software products/licensing, and to change vendors would be cost prohibitive.  To note, there would be training expenses on new software requirements, which affect each user's desktop and servers in each DOL agency.  Additionally, there would be cost prohibitive expenses to re-license each desktop and server across the DOL enterprise to another vendor's software.  Therefore, the cost to change to another vendor would greatly outweigh the cost to remain in the Microsoft environment.  Due to the cost prohibitive nature of changing vendors, only Microsoft supplies/services will satisfy the Department's requirements.  Also, Microsoft products are proprietary software; and, as such Microsoft is the developer and holds the rights and the patents.  Microsoft provides the technical expertise required to support this software including all of the software updates.

The period of performance is for a base year and two one-year option periods.  The estimated dollar value over the course of three years exceeds $10 million.  

The solicitation will be made available for competition to the approved Microsoft resale vendors on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  DOL intends to issue a firm-fixed-price BPA based on proposed GSA FSS discounts proposed by vendors.  

This award will be made on or about April 1, 2007.     The proposed acquisition is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only authorized Microsoft Software Leasing Enterprise Agreement resellers in accordance with FAR 8.4, 8.405-6(2).     For further information, please contact Ms. Jennifer Snook, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room S1519B, Washington, D.C. 20210, snook.jennifer@dol.gov, (202) 693-4585.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

<CONTACT>David Nemerow 202-781-3314
<DESC>This is a follow-on acquisition as defined in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award, via a limited competitive solicitation, Phase II contracts to the most qualified Contractor(s) performing under current Common Enterprise Display Systems (CEDS) Phase I contracts.  CEDS is a family of display systems that will provide the Navy’s enterprise display solution and the Phase I contracts were awarded on 13 DEC 2006 via full-and-open competition.  Under the 4 current Phase I contracts for preliminary design, 2 contracts support display consoles and 2 contracts support remote displays.  This Phase II effort includes development, qualification, production and support of CEDS display consoles and remote displays.  The Phase I contractors will have accumulated significant technical expertise during Phase I performance, developed unique knowledge of system engineering processes and documented the associated technical data.  These capabilities are !  unlikely to be resident at organizations other than those participating in the effort from the inception.  Government resources dedicated to the CEDS efforts are limited, and efforts to add additional contractors to the pool of current competitors would require additional resources that are not available, and this would introduce unacceptable programmatic risk to program schedules.  As such, it is determined that any further efforts to increase competition of Phase II through full and open competition at this stage of the schedule would not be practicable.  Information regarding the award of the Phase I contracts can be found at the following link: http://www.fbodaily.com/archive/2006/12-December/15-Dec-2006/59-awd.htm

NTI manufactures the Rackmux-T15 console drawer.  The product is unique in the industry, as it provides the benefits of a keyboard/video/ mouse (KVM) drawer while offering VT100 emulation capabilities.  Having these features in a single unit, and one that is a "dumb terminal" with no data processing capability is a market niche that NTI can provide.  Additionally its size allows the unit to be integrated into the tight physical design of the AN/MRC-142C. In accordance with FAR 13.5, a Commercial, type contract is anticipated. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334113 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an “out-of-the-box” solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ·	Conducting development efforts ·	Testing developed products ·	Compatibility testing ·	Use case scenario testing ·	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ·	Training ·	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>support contract # 32102.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the 3M-AIT Passport Reader.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the 3M-AIT Passport Readers to support Consular posts overseas.  3M-AIT Passport Readers have been deployed in all Consular Systems Modernization installations since the inception of the program. Additional units are primarily required at this time to replace any existing AIT PAX readers in need of maintenance, thus extending the life of the VISA Quality Assurance procedure.  The reader was initially selected because the travel document production systems with which it is used required an accurate, reliable instrument to perform quality assurance checks on the OCR zones of visas and passports, thereby validating their machine readability. The reader enables Consulates to generate travel documents that will be accepted and accurately interpreted at any port of entry employing mechanized processing systems. This is of great importance since it eliminates or minimizes incidences of false interpretations of bearer identification data.  Such “mis-reads” can result in the refusal of entry or passage to qualified bearers, impede the processing flows at ports of entry, and otherwise embarrass the U.S. Government.  The AIT reader was selected following a very lengthy market survey and evaluation process.  It was found to be the only device of its type able to meet the Bureau’s specifications.  Features of the unit evaluated are as follows: ·	Reads International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and non-ICAO compliant documents ·	Performs quality assurance analysis ·	Multi-function magnetic stripe reader and OCR ·	Two RS-232 serial ports and one universal serial bus (USB) port ·	Remotely upgradeable software<BR><BR>CHANGED CONTRACT REQUIREMENT TO NASA SEWP III<BR><BR>

Market Survey/Sources Sought ? Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center

In response to the 2005 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is conducting a market survey to seek potential small business sources (including 8(a), small disadvantaged, HUBZone, veteran-owned small business and service disabled veteran-owned small business) to evaluate the establishment of a Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center to conduct technical assistance and patient safety event data de-identification services for certified Patient Safety Organizations.

AHRQ is seeking potential sources from qualified small business firms under NAICS Code 541990 (size standard - $6.5 million) which can demonstrate the capability to create, operate, maintain, and enhance a Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center.  

The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act established a framework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal environment.  The act extends legal privilege and confidentiality to health care providers voluntarily reporting patient safety events and ?close calls? to patient safety organizations (PSO) which will be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  In turn, PSOs collect and analyze patient safety data to develop and help providers implement patient safety improvement strategies in a protected legal environment. Additionally, the act authorizes the Secretary to ?facilitate the creation of and maintain a network of patient safety databases that provides an interactive evidence-based management resource.?  This network shall ?accept, aggregate across the network, and analyze non-identifiable patient safety work product voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations.?  The Act also allows the Secretary to specify common formats for the reporting of patient safety information to the network and to provide technical assistance to PSOs.

To facilitate the efficient and effective operation of PSOs and minimize the reporting burden of PSOs contributing data to the Network of Patient Safety Databases, AHRQ proposes to create and support a PSO Privacy Protection Center.  This center will offer technical assistance to PSOs, receive patient safety event information from PSOs, and render this information non-identifiable. The PSO Privacy Protection Center will then transfer de-identified information to the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

The anticipated relationships between the PSOs, the PSO Privacy Protection Center, the Network of Patient Safety Databases, AHRQ and other potential users of information from the Network are illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
This market survey is for the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  A separate market survey will be issued for the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

Specific work in this project will include establishing the PSO Privacy Protection Center, receiving information on patient safety events from PSOs who participate, rendering this information non-identifiable, transferring non-identifiable information of patient safety events to the Network of Patient Safety Database, and providing technical assistance to PSOs to support patient safety activities.  

Related tasks include convening experts as needed to guide PSO Privacy Protection Center activities and functions, and conducting an annual meeting of PSOs. 

Of utmost importance will be to protect the security and confidentiality of any patient safety event information.  The Contractor will be required to develop procedures and mechanisms that shall adhere to all Federal, DHHS and AHRQ IT security and confidentiality regulations.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their knowledge and expertise with all applicable confidentiality and security procedures (including the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Health Service Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and other applicable AHRQ and DHHS regulations).  The Contractor will need to retain at least one staff member who has a demonstrated understanding of the HIPAA and Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act privacy rules and confidentiality protections.  The Contractor will be required to develop a PSO Privacy Protection Center Security Plan and conduct regular security audits.

The Contractor will be required to use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) in the management of this contract that is consistent with ANSI/EIA-STD-748 guidelines.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their past experience with EVMS management.  

It is anticipated that the process of rendering patient safety information non-identifiable will entail considerable planning and work.  Information will need to be processed such that no individual patient, provider, or report can be identified.  This process will need to go beyond simple removal of unique patient, provider, and reporter identifiers and consider unique combinations of information that might inadvertently identify a patient, provider, or reporter.  Sources responding to this market survey must demonstrate in their response their expertise and experience in data de-identification.

The Contractor will be required to establish and maintain an expert panel to advise and provide feedback on the activities of the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  The panel will include both individuals with expertise in the delivery of technical assistance related to patient safety and individuals with expertise processing patient safety event information.  The Contractor will hold and provide support for the expert panel meetings.

Another important aspect to contribute to the success of this project depends on the willingness of PSOs to supply information/data on a voluntary basis.  A main function of the PSA Privacy Protection Center is to aid PSOs to minimize the burden on PSOs in supplying information to the PSO Privacy Protection Center and the recruitment of PSOs to supply data.  This will involve the development of a recruitment and incentive plan for PSOs.  The Contractor will create and maintain policies and procedures for partner PSO information resources and submission materials.  The Contractor will contact and actively recruit PSOs as partners and will execute partner agreements.  The Contractor will form PSO partner workgroups and manage and host a partner PSO listserv.  The Contractor will be a central resource to provide technical assistance to PSOs.   Potential sources must demonstrate their experience and expertise in this type of activity.

Potential respondents to this market survey should note that the separation of the functions of the Privacy Protection Center and of the Network is intentional; the Privacy Protection Center will work with information supplied directly by PSOs while the Network will only handle standardized information that has been rendered non-identifiable.  Hence, an organization can receive the contract for only one entity, the Privacy Protection Center or the Network, but not both.

Sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their expertise and experience and describe personnel with relevant education and demonstrated experience in areas such as:
?	Knowledge of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and activities of PSOs
?	Knowledge of current patient safety tools, resources, organizational leaders and subject matter experts
?	Knowledge of legal policies and procedures related to use of protected health information (PHI- HIPAA, etc)
?	Skills in the development, implementation, and use of clinical data, especially patient safety reporting system data, to improve quality of care
?	Skills in processing and managing large clinical databases in a secure environment
?	Skills in managing and working with patient safety experts 
?	Ability to create knowledge based  tools to be used in the patient safety and health care quality environment
?	Ability to organize and conduct both large meetings and smaller topic specific workgroups and seminars
	
In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content-driven projects under tight timelines. 
A Project Management Institute (PMI)-certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide Earned Value Management (EVM) information. 

Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to:  Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville MD, 20850 
E-mail: Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov 

Capability statements must be received no later than March 15, 2007, by 4:00 p.m.

Capability statements should address the specific requirements of this notice and identify the source's capabilities to complete this requirement, including, but not limited to information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects. Capability statements should be submitted in an original and 2 copies or electronically. Electronic submissions should be submitted before noon to allow for processing.

Market Survey/Sources Sought ? Network of Patient Safety Databases

In response to the 2005 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is conducting a market survey to seek potential small business sources (including 8(a), small disadvantaged, HUBZone, veteran-owned small business and service disabled veteran-owned small business) to establish and maintain a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD) to fulfill the functions of such a network as specified in the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act.

AHRQ is seeking potential sources from qualified small business firms under NAICS Code  541990 (size standard - $6.5 million) which can demonstrate the capability to create, operate, maintain, and enhance a Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) established a framework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal environment.  The act extends legal privilege and confidentiality to health care providers voluntarily reporting patient safety events that harmed or could have harmed (close calls) and analyses of these events to patient safety organizations (PSO).  PSOs that are listed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will aggregate and analyze patient safety data to assist providers implement patient safety improvement strategies in a protected legal environment. Additionally, the act authorizes the Secretary to ?facilitate the creation of and maintain a network of patient safety databases that provides an interactive evidence-based management resource.?  This network shall ?accept, aggregate across the network, and analyze non-identifiable patient safety work product voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations.?  The Act also allows the Secretary to specify common formats for the reporting of patient safety information to the network and to provide technical assistance to PSOs.

To facilitate a deeper level of analysis of patient safety events and to allow PSOs and providers access to an effective and robust resource for patient safety improvement, AHRQ proposes to create and support a Network of Patient Safety Databases.  The Network will receive non-identifiable patient safety event information from PSOs primarily through the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  It will have the capacity to receive non-identifiable, standardized patient safety information from PSOs not utilizing the PSO Privacy Protection Center and, potentially, from other entities. The Network will analyze the non-identifiable information received and create statistical reports useful to the patient safety community and to meet the reporting requirements of AHRQ. The Network will also serve as an interactive, evidence-based resource for PSOs and will work in close coordination with the PSO Privacy Protection Center in the distribution of analyses of patient safety information to the PSOs, providers, and other entities concerned with patient safety. The Network may be required to offer technical assistance to PSOs if requested by AHRQ and should be capable of providing such assistance.   

This market survey is for the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  A separate market survey will be issued for the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  

Potential respondents to this market survey should note that the separation of the functions of the Privacy Protection Center and of the Network is intentional; the Privacy Protection Center will work with information supplied directly by PSOs while the Network will only handle standardized information that has been rendered non-identifiable.  Hence, an organization can receive the contract for only one entity, the Privacy Protection Center or the Network, but not both.

Specific work in this project will include establishing the Network of Patient Safety Databases, receiving non-identifiable, standardized information on patient safety events from the PSO Privacy Protection Center (and other entities as practical and relevant), creating statistical reports and tools to reduce risk to patients and to improve the quality of care, distributing these reports and tools, and serving as an interactive, evidence-based resource for PSOs.  Potential related tasks include provision of technical assistance to PSOs. 

While only non-identifiable patient information should be received by the Network of Patient Safety Databases, an important aim remains to protect the security and confidentiality of all patient safety event information.  Therefore, the Contractor must develop procedures and mechanisms that adhere to all Federal, DHHS and AHRQ IT security and confidentiality regulations.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their knowledge and expertise with all applicable confidentiality and security procedures (including the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Health Service Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and other applicable AHRQ and DHHS regulations.  The Contractor will need to retain at least one staff member who has a demonstrated understanding of the HIPAA and Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act privacy rules and confidentiality protections.  The Contractor will be required to develop a PSO Privacy Protection Center Security Plan and conduct regular security audits.

The Contractor will be required to use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) in the management of this contract that is consistent with ANSI/EIA-STD-748 guidelines.  Potential sources must demonstrate in their response to this market survey their past experience with EVMS management.  

The key work of the Network of Patient Safety Databases is to conduct analyses that support efforts to track and improve patient safety.  This work includes support of the National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports, analyses of trends and patterns of healthcare error at the national and regional levels and other analyses that support efforts to improve patient safety.

The PSQIA also charges the Network of Patient Safety Databases to provide an interactive, evidence-based management resource for providers, PSOs and other entities.  This resource may take the form of a web-based tool that allows users to search and browse the non-identifiable information submitted to the Network.  This resource must conform to Federal, DHHS and AHRQ requirements in laws, policies and directives for information technology, capital planning and investment, and Internet information management and the security of agency information and systems.  Potential offerors must demonstrate and describe their abilities and experience in developing and maintaining this type of resource in their response to this market survey.  

The Contractor will be required to provide general technical assistance to PSOs to include forming workgroups, establishing and maintaining a listserv, a central resource to provide advice to individual PSOs, the development of various types of products and tools to provide assistance to the PSOs, development of educational briefs (1-2 pages) each month, and the creation of tools or templates of use to PSOs.  Interested sources should include in their responses to this market survey a demonstrated ability to provide technical assistance of this type. 

Sources must demonstrate expertise and personnel with relevant education and demonstrated experience in areas such as:
?	Knowledge of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, activities of PSOs, and the function of the NPSD
?	Knowledge of legal policies and procedures related to use of protected health information (HIPAA, etc)
?	Knowledge of patient safety tools, resources, organizational leaders and subject matter experts 
?	Skills in processing and managing large clinical databases in a secure environment
?	Skills in the analysis and interpretation of aggregated clinical data, especially patient safety reporting system data, to reduce risks to patients and to improve the quality of care
?	Skills in managing and working with patient safety experts 
?	Ability to create knowledge-based reports to be used in the patient safety and health care quality environment
?	Ability to develop an interactive resource that allows PSOs and providers to access patient safety event information to improve patient safety
?	Expertise in developing and managing complex content-driven projects under tight timelines. 

A Project Management Institute (PMI)-certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide Earned Value Management (EVM) information.

<DESC>This is an amendment to Topical Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for In-Ground Fiber Optic Sensor Systems for Detection, Classification, and Localization of Explosions, Explosive Device Placement, and Border Intrusions, BAA #070334.  This amendment is intended to clarify questions concerning schedule and funding issues. This BAA is concerned primarily with Phase II of the overall fiber-optic sensing program.  Phase II focuses on the evaluation of mature, candidate sensors and system technologies, and on the selection of the single sensor that will be used in the final end-to-end system demonstration in Phase IV.  The anticipated timeline for Phase II is December 2006 to May 2007, with two sub-phases.  In the first sub-phase (December 2006 to February 2007), the sensor and system technologies proposed under this BAA will be evaluated using existing vendor-supplied specifications and test results. The goal will be the selection of fiber-optic sensors with associated signal processing for further in-ground testing.  Up to six (6) sensors may be selected in this sub-phase for further testing.  NOTE: The original BAA synopsis discussed the pre-selection of six (6) sensors for bench-top testing, from which the three sensors would be selected for in-ground testing.  Issues have been raised concerning the usefulness of such bench-top tests, however, such that the pre-selection and bench-top testing portion of the BAA has been eliminated to allow a more focused effort on the in-ground testing.  In the second sub-phase (March to May 2007), the sensors selected in the first sub-phase will be subjected to a side-by-side in-ground comparison test at a location to be determined (most likely on the NUWC campus or nearby).  This test will focus on a short section (nominally 300 feet) of in-ground fiber, possibly with an on-spool lead to simulate conditions at the end of a longer fiber. Also, these preliminary tests will focus on the fiber-optic sensor, front-end electronics, signal processing, and detector, and NOT on event classification and localization.  The most important performance metrics for this phase are detection performance and aural reproduction capability.  Funding may be made available to selected vendors to supply a prototype sensor and support testing (NOTE: The government does NOT intend to retain sensor systems after testing is complete). It is anticipated that funding of approximately $50K to 100K will be available for each selected vendor to support the preliminary in-ground testing.  The results of this side-by-side test will be used to select a single sensor system for the final in-ground demonstration to be held at a location to be determined (most likely Yuma, AZ) in the July/August 2007 time frame.  The Phase IV demonstration will be a complete end-to-end test, including sensor, electronics, front-end processing, and detection, classification, and localization capabilities.  The sensor system selected for this test will be purchased by the government.  Funding of approximately $100K to 200K will be made available under this project for the system purchase and test support. The BAA also calls for systems technologies such as classification and localization algorithms for FO sensing systems.  Any technologies proposed along these lines will be evaluated separately from the FO sensor system itself (if it is proposed with a sensor).  If selected, such technologies would be folded into the automation algorithm development portion (Phase III) of the overall program, which will be executed in the period from March to June 2007.

<DESC>Solid Hydrogen Storage Broad Agency Announcement N00164-07-R-6967 Questions and Answers NOTE:  This document is identified as Amendment 0001 to Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00164-07-R-6967. Q1:  Is chemical storage of H2 an acceptable option, or is it limited to reversible adsorption systems? A:  Concept 1 applies only to reversible adsorbent type materials. Chemical hydrogen storage that is regenerated off-board would not be included.   For concept 2, chemical storage is not excluded, however, reversible solid-state systems are preferred. Q2:  Can the sub-scale prototypes include H2 chemical storage designed for off-board recharge? A: See answer to Q1. Q3:  Can the operating conditions, contaminants, etc. be better described in the BAA to allow a viable match of technologies? A:  The systems described in this BAA are intended primarily for fuel cell use.  Guidelines are being developed for specific contaminants and concentration levels for fuel cell tolerance (such as ammonia, sulfur-based materials, etc.).  While these guidelines are evolving, examples of contaminant specifications can be seen in the  Appendix on Hydrogen Quality at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/mypp/" As described in the BAA, applicants are required to evaluate and document operability over a range of temperature conditions. Q4:  Can DOD applications be described better to ensure the breadth of the technology proposed? A: Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are being considered for a variety of DOD applications such as (but not limited to) UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), UUVs (unmanned underwater vehicles), man-portable power, vehicle and stationary power. However, at the current time, no specific end-use application has been determined. Q5:  Is  this opportunity appropriate for University research teams or just companies?  A:  University research teams may apply. Q6:  Are government entities eligible to participate in the BAA?  May we work as subcontractors on a project?  A:  A prime contractor may submit a proposal that identifies areas of the effort that government subcontractor would support.  The proposal would need to define the tasking and cost related to the government subcontractor’s support.  In the event the prime’s proposal was selected for award, the government subcontractor’s participation would not be as a subcontractor to the prime or through the prime’s contract but would be defined in a Government to Government agreement between NSWC Crane and the government subcontractor.  Q7: Can you propose chemical hydride based systems (primary storage systems) under concept #2 of BAA? A:  See answer to Q1.  Q8:  What is/are the applications intended for the technology? A: See answer to Q4. Q9:  What power level prototype can be delivered for Concept #2?  Could it be for a 5 or 10 W prototype? A:  While the BAA specifies that discharge rates are needed to power a fuel cell stack between 0.5 kW to up to 5 kW (peak power), applicants may propose systems for 50 W or higher (up to 5 kW).  At the current time, prototypes that are only capable of discharge rates capable of supporting fuel cell stacks of 5 or 10 W are not desired. Q10:  Are non-US partners allowed? A: The BAA does not exclude non-U.S. partners.  However, other Government regulations, including but not limited to part 25 of the FAR and part 225 of the DFARS, may limit participation by some non-US partners. Q11:  Is information from the proposal disclosed outside of the selection process?   A:  No. Q12:  What are the guidelines for proposal submittal? A: The guidelines for submittal of a proposal are contained in the BAA. Major elements include: •	Due date: 22 March 2007 •	Proposal (two parts) : Technical Proposal (limited to 20 pages) and Cost Proposal •	Submission: via email to LogR&D@navy.mil Q13:  Is there any benefit for universities teaming with industry? A:  Teaming is not required to respond to the BAA. Each proposer must determine if teaming benefits the qualifications, capabilities and experience of their proposal. Q14:  When do you anticipate funding to be available to begin work? A: Funding for the project is in place at NSWC Crane and will be placed on contract when award is made. Q15:  The BAA mentions “adsorption” energy scales of 5kJ/mol and temperature ranges including 77K; does this mean you are looking for adsorption in metal oxide frameworks [MOFs] or are suitable complex metal hydrides acceptable?   (eg 1 to 100 bar H2 and 1 to 100 Deg C for the adsorption/desorption range) A: The BAA is not restricted to only MOFs.   Suitable complex metal hydrides are allowed.  All storage materials must comply with the specifications in the BAA to be considered. Q16:  What specifically is the deliverable? Only screening capability or ability to provide novel materials to screen? (i.e., do you want a machine to screen or a material with a suitable weight %) A: [Under concept one] Proposer shall develop screening processes and techniques as per BAA.  The deliverables shall be the documentation of the screening process and a demonstration of the ability to reproducibly screen a minimum of 10 solid state material adsorbents per run. Q17:  There seems to be a large emphasis on reversible hydrogen storage. Are those the technologies that this BAA favors? A:  See answer to Q1 Q18:  Concerning the acceptable power range, can the proposal target a smaller vehicular application, for example a UAV power source at about 100 W? A:  See answers to Q4 and Q9 Q19:  We would like to know how many awards you anticipate making under this BAA. A:    The BAA states:  “Multiple awards are anticipated.  The funding allocated to this program for all awards is planned at $1,500,000 for 2007 with any additional funding subject to appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $300,000 and $400,000.”  The actual number of awards will depend on the quality and size of the proposals we receive. Q 20:  Will you include chemical hydrides in both categories of this solicitation? A:  See Answer to Q1 Q21:  Can you please explain what is meant by "increasing the hydrogen adsorption energy above the typical 5 kJ/mol for such materials" -- this is mentioned in the Concept area # 1 description? A:  Hydrogen adsorption energies for typical materials that adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures (eg, 77 K) are roughly 5 kJ/mol.  In order to store hydrogen closer to room temperature, hydrogen adsorption energies must be increased above 5 kJ/mol.  This would permit stronger "binding" or adsorption of hydrogen to solid-state adsorbent type materials.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Grand Jury and/or Deposition Court Reporting Services.  No later than 11:00AM on Monday, March 19, 2007, please provide this office with a price and technical proposal, to include proposed personnel resumes, to accomplish the work described in the attached Statement of Work. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on organizational past performance, organizational experience, key personnel and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an “out-of-the-box” solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ·	Conducting development efforts ·	Testing developed products ·	Compatibility testing ·	Use case scenario testing ·	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ·	Training ·	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Introduction

The economic growth challenges facing the small island countries of the eastern Caribbean are daunting.  Recently, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that European preferences for Caribbean bananas and sugar, as well as tourism (considered to be the backbone of the Caribbean region economy) are illegal and must be dismantled.  This has sent economic shockwaves through the region, as demonstrated by the collapse of the banana industry in Dominica shortly after the WTO rulings, which resulted in a US$100 million annual loss in revenue.  In addition, small island economies are increasingly more vulnerable to natural disasters, as demonstrated by the economic collapse of Grenada due to Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Emily in 2005, which resulted in over US$900 million in damage.  Lastly, the Caribbean region has the second fastest growing HIV epidemic outside of Africa, which if not addressed will further impact the economies on these small island countries.  In response to these vulnerabilities, the region is attempting to better organize regional trade agreements through the formalization and implementation of a single market and economy, and the region also has a well organized HIV regional strategy to address HIV issues.  However, political will and action is significantly lacking, particularly in the areas of HIV and risk reduction to natural disasters. 

The Office of the USAID Representative to Barbados (USAID/Barbados) represents a resumption of regional assistance after a hiatus from 1996 to 1999.  The current strategy for the eastern Caribbean is a sustainable development strategy that focuses limited resources on the two most urgent challenges facing the region ? the challenge to compete in open markets and the challenge to control HIV/AIDS.  The descriptive goal statement of the regional strategy is: Caribbean region is globally competitive in trade and in quality of life.  In order to thrive over the long run, the region must not only compete economically in global markets, but also retain and attract the human talent that will enable it to remain competitive.

USAID/Barbados is responsible for implementing both regional and bilateral development assistance.  Regional assistance is in support of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) regional efforts as they relate to trade, HIV and disaster risk reduction.  Direct support at the country ? level in these same three areas is provided to at least six eastern Caribbean countries where USAID has no mission presence.  USAID?s regional strategy is comprised of two five-year development strategies.   The first strategic objective, Region positioned to succeed in an open trade environment, is approximately US$8 million annual strategy that focuses on enhanced trade capacity including a component on disaster risk reduction.   The second strategic objective, Enhanced Regional response to the Caribbean HIV/AIDS epidemic, is an approximately US$5 million annual strategy that focuses on addressing issues and barriers to successfully combating HIV/AIDS in the region and enhancing the Caribbean region?s capacity to effectively respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  In addition, during fiscal years 2004 and 2005, USAID/Barbados also managed a rapid scale-up US$42 million hurricane recovery program in Grenada.   

Summary of HIV/AIDS Strategy

Though it is one of the smallest HIV/AIDS global "hot spots" in terms of number of cases, the Caribbean is one of the highest profile regions in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.  The region has the second highest HIV prevalence rate in the world after Africa and inadequate infrastructure is available to address the problem in many of these fragile, small island economies.  The adult prevalence rate in the Caribbean region is 2.3% (UNAIDS Report 2005).  Furthermore, several country-level studies indicate that there are concentrated epidemics of HIV that ranging from 15% to 40% for the most-at-risk populations in the region, such as Suriname and Trinidad.   

Some of the  challenges in addressing HIV in the Caribbean are the inadequate level of HIV specialty-trained service providers to deliver HIV prevention and monitoring services, a high degree of stigma and discrimination against those living with HIV, and weak monitoring systems to adequately track and target the epidemic.  This is exacerbated by migration and mobility, both within the region as well as outside, creating a high-risk environment for the further spread of HIV.    

The five-year strategy aims to enhance the Caribbean?s response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by focusing assistance in three areas: 1) expanding access to HIV prevention and treatment services, 2) improving the availability and use of accurate and reliable information, and 3) expanding access to risk reduction behavior change interventions.  This focus includes support at the regional level for the on-going efforts of Caribbean regional organizations, as well as focused technical assistance within nine Eastern Caribbean countries, which are viewed as some of the most vulnerable in the region   

Due to a relatively constrained budget, USAID is concentrating its efforts in building HIV/AIDS capacity in the region.  Funding levels have varied since 2001 and average between US $4 million to US $6 million annually.  Given this, to the extent possible, USAID aims to leverage other external resources and to mobilize existing resources (both public and commercial sector) in order to maintain all three focus areas under the current strategy. 

Assistance under this strategy is guided by the priority areas outlined in the Caribbean Community?s Pan-Caribbean Partnership against HIV/AIDS (CARICOM/PANCAP) Regional Strategic Framework.  USAID?s strategy implementation has been in partnership with regional organizations as well as international, regional, and local NGOs. In addition to CARICOM/ PANCAP, other regional Caribbean partners include the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC), the Caribbean Coalition of National AIDS Program Coordinators (CCNAPC), the University of the West Indies (UWI) Caribbean HIV/AIDS Regional Training Initiative (CHART), and the Caribbean Regional Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (CRN+).  USAID has established bilateral working relationships with host country officials, organizations, and informal networks in the nine countries in the Eastern Caribbean that are receiving assistance.  Working with this complex network of regional and national institutional partners to build their capacity is a direct application of the principle of ?transformational diplomacy? as articulated by the U.S. Department of State, and makes implementing USAID/Barbados? HIV/AIDS program both challenging and uniquely rewarding.  

USAID collaborates with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and through this collaboration the two agencies play the lead role in implementing much of the regional US Government assistance in the Eastern Caribbean.  Other US Government agencies involved include Peace Corps, the Department of Labor and the Department of Defense. Each of these US Government agencies is actively providing assistance in key areas addressing HIV issues in the Caribbean.  Although USAID and CDC have been co-programming funds at the activity level, further effort needs to be undertaken to frame a regional U.S. Government strategy. 

USAID/Barbados

The Office of the USAID Representative is based in Bridgetown, Barbados and is comprised of ten staff, with daily operations and program implementation supervised by the USAID Representative.  The remaining Barbados staff includes a trade and competitiveness strategic objective team comprised of one Third Country National (TCN) and one Foreign Service National (FSN); an HIV/AIDS strategic objective team comprised of one U.S. technical advisor and one FSN.  The technical staff is supported by one FSN program management specialist, two administrative FSNs and one USPSC administrative specialist.  Additional support (administrative backstopping, contracting, legal and financial management) is provided by USAID Dominican Republic.  USAID?s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) maintains office space in the Barbados office as a base for periodic temporary operations.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration has a requirement for Executive Search Recruiting Services.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) anticipates that this SIR will result in the award of multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to Offerors found to be technically qualified/capable to receive an award based on the requirements of the statement of work (SOW) and the stated Evaluation Criteria.  Award of a BPA will allow those Offerors determined to be qualified/capable to then compete for individual executive search requirements as they arise via proposed Orders which the FAA will issue separately as described in Section 8 of the SIR each time a requirement for such services arise. The FAA anticipates that the contract type will be firm, fixed price with a total potential period of performance of five years, i.e., one base year plus four one-year options.   At this time, the FAA plans to request proposals for both technical qualifications/capabilities and prices. This is a full and open competitive procurement.

<DESC>1.  The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for training services to provide courseware development, simulator and academic instruction for Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) for the T-1, T-6, T-37 and T-38 aircraft; Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF); Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV) Training; and Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training services in support of the UFT and other United States Air Force (USAF) training requirements.  Services shall be provided to aircrews as assigned by AETC, currently located at Randolph AFB, TX; Vance AFB, OK; Columbus AFB, MS; Sheppard AFB, TX; and Laughlin AFB, TX.  The contractor shall provide sufficient, qualified instructors, operational, administrative, management and supervisory personnel to perform the required training services.

2.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 611512 applies.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 611512, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size standard is $21.5 million).  “Small business” means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than “small business” in the next 90 days, please indicate as such.

3.  This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited.  If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date with the issuance of an RFP to industry, the value of the resulting contract is estimated to be $400 million for a period of 6 years.  The anticipated award date is September 2007.

4.  Contractors will require a SECRET facility clearance.  The contract will include a DD Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, as the contractor will have access to classified Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) materials for working on undergraduate EWO courseware.

5.  A draft Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) has been posted along with this sources sought synopsis to provide a more detailed description of the requirement, and for any industry comments.  The PWS is still a work-in-progress, and this is NOT the final version.

6.  It is the Government’s intent to award one contract.  The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns.  (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)  Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H, I and J below).

7.  All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners:

A.  Company/Institute Name and CAGE code.
B.  Mailing Address.
C.  Point of Contact (to include phone/fax and e-mail).
D.  Web site, if applicable.
E.  State if your company is registered under NAICS code 611512 or not.
F.  State whether your company is small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUB-Zone, or 8(a) certified business concern.
G.  State the size of your company in terms of personnel.
H.  Degree of experience providing flying training instruction (classroom and simulator), and producing/maintaining courseware for the same.
I.  Identify any past or current Government contracts for flying training instruction within the last three years.
J.  Briefly describe how your company can satisfy the requirements described in the attached PWS, and your associated technical capabilities.

8.  Responses are due no later than 1600 CDT, Monday, 5 June 2006, and shall be electronically submitted to both the Contract Specialist, Mr. Andrew Feutz, at andrew.feutz2@randolph.af.mil and the Contracting Officer, Mr. Kevin Shackleford, at kevin.shackleford@randolph.af.mil in a Word 97 (or above) or Adobe PDF file format.

9.  Questions relative to this market research should be sent electronically to both Andrew Feutz and Kevin Shackleford.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
ENVIRONMENTAL FAMILIARIZATION LABORATORY 
This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government will not pay for any information requested in this Request For Information (RFI).  Responses will be done at no cost to the Government.  The government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement.  Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  It will be the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions in any resultant Request for Proposal and awarded contract.

The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) provides Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training year-round at Fairchild Air Force Base.  The 336th Training Group is soliciting for support to conduct vector simulator training in its state-of-the-art environmental familiarization laboratory.  Vendor will be required to build and maintain simulator training within the existing E&S Digistar 3 system (system overview listed  below) that meets the following criteria:  

1.  Reproduce computer generated (CG) 3 dimensional models depicting a variety of military aircraft (helo, fighter).  Models need to be detailed enough for extreme close ups when viewed at 1600 x 1200 resolution.
2.  Create all audio necessary to create a realistic scenario consistent with visual data to include narration.
3.  Program real time aircraft models in Digistar 3 system to allow control of position, rotation, pitch and roll.  Actions must correspond with student and controller joystick input.
4. Control real time directional model referencing  operator & student input from a magnetic compass.
5.  Track and record model relative position in database
6.  Create multiple 3 dimensional environments (arctic, temperate, desert, etc.). 
with changeable lighting conditions (day/night/dusk/dawn) for real time models to operate within.

System Overview:
E&S Digistar 3 system currently consists of nine Barco video projectors for imaging on the dome.  Five projectors form a continuous horizon image, and the sixth projector forms a "cap" that fills in the zenith.  Additionally, three more projectors form a skirt below the front horizon (unique to Fairchild AFB).  Each projector is mounted underneath the spring line of the dome.  The graphics processors (GPs) that feed the projectors have an initial on-line video playback capacity of approximately 2 hours and the native resolution for each frame of video is 1600 x 1200 pixels.
Full Dome Production Standards:
- Models and environments must be rendered out at 1200 x 1200, 30 frames per second (fps) using a five camera rig with each camera set to zero space.  Recommended nominal camera tilt of 15° great circle.  Cameras are oriented forward, backward, left, right and up.  Each camera renders to its corresponding folder, front, left, etc.  Files will be sequentially numbered lossless files: SGI RGB, TIFF or TARGAs with RLE compression, JPEG at highest-quality (i.e., near lossless).
- Completed renders then must be converted to equidistant azimuthal “fisheye” render representing up to full sphere with bottom of the frame representing the front bottom
of the dome screen, and the right and left hand sides of the master correspond with the respective right and left sides of the dome to a viewer sitting at dome center within the theater. Top and sides of polar image are tangent to edges of image frame.  Files will be sequentially numbered lossless files: SGI RGB, TIFF or TARGAs with RLE compression, JPEG at highest-quality (i.e., near lossless)
- Dome Masters then encoded to movie files: MPEG-2, for assignment to 9 graphics processors each assigned to a Barco Projector.
- 5.1 surround sound consistent with environment and objects in scene.  
1) Surround Format – Stereo, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, or stem tracks
2) File Format – WAV, AIFF
3) Leader with test tones (-18dbv)
4) Sample Frequency (e.g., 48kHz) and bit depth (e.g., 16 bits)
5) Frame rate for video sync (29.97 vs. 30 fps)
6) Start frame of 01:00:00:00
7) Basic audio file naming convention:
FILENAME CHANNEL
filename_L.wav Front Left
filename_R.wav Front Right
filename_Ls.wav Rear Left
filename_Rs.wav Rear Right
filename_C.wav Center Mid
filename_T.wav Center High (Top)
filename_LFE.wav Low frequency channel (Sub-bass)
filename_XXX.wav T.B.D.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL ANNOUNCEMENT -- SEE HOUSE WEB SITE FOR COMPLETE SOLICITATION DOCUMENT.  

BACKGROUND: 

The United States House of Representatives Child Care Center (HRCCC) has been providing full-day, year-round quality child care for children of the Members, their staff and House support personnel since 1987. The Center accommodates children from 10 weeks to 5 years of age.  This spacious facility has 5 classrooms and amenities such as a large multi-purpose room, a play theater, a playground area, a state-of-the-art security system, and a fenced guarded entrance adjacent to the Ford House Office Building. The House provides space, utilities and security, and the Center is otherwise self-sustaining with staff payroll, meals and other expenses being fully funded through enrollment fees. Currently, 65 children are enrolled in the Center; maximum capacity is 70 children. There are currently 95 families on the waiting list.

OBJECTIVE: 

The House desires to eliminate the waiting list and provide services in a cost-effective, green manner and provide the best possible day care for House employees. The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) requires contractor support to conduct a study and analysis of alternatives with the objective to make well informed decisions.  This is a major undertaking which requires specialized knowledge of space allocations, regulations and standards, operational requirements and impacts, construction, costs, etc.  

This project has a short time schedule; the report is required within three months of award.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV,  Field Studies Branch of the Division of Resporatory Disease Studies would like to issue a purchase order for  the procurement of analytical services for speciated culturable fungi, bacteria (gram positive, negative, broad spectrum, and three most predominant genus identification), Actinomycetes (total:  room temperature, mesophilic, and thermophilic), speciated culturable mycobacteria, and allergens (Cat, dog, two types of dust mites, and cockroach allergens) analyses of floor dust samples.

NIOSH has an ongoing multi-year research program which includes investigations of building dampness, fungal contamination and respiratory health effects in office buildings and schools, for which we need to compare results across individual studies.  Environmental Microbiology Laboratory has previously analyzed samples collected for studies within this program.  Culturable fungi bacterial analyses have a high degree of potential variability due to a number of factors, including culture techniques, as well as enumeration and identification techniques.  Differences in laboratory protocols and procedures could lead to potentially significant differences  in fungal and bacterial species identification and quantification, which may affect the validity of comparison across studies.  Therefore, it is very important that we keep the same laboratory (Environmental Microbiological Laboratory) to obtain comparable results using consistent methods across individual studies within the program.

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party must demonstrate in writing their ability to meet the requirements outlined above to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, Reference: 000HCCHB-2007-41538, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 or Fax to 304-285-6083 or e-mail RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to Environmental microbiology Laboratory, Inc. without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NTD070005729

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Braxton, Contracting Officer, Phone 7037673531, Fax 7037674441, Email elizabeth.braxton@dtra.mil
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided for requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources for the development of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for Radiological Sample Collection following a nuclear/radiological event. The UGV needs to be an unmanned semi-autonomous all-weather all-terrain sample collection vehicle.  The goal of the UGV is to aid in assessment and collection of radiological samples in areas too dangerous for manual collection. The system will be remotely operated, enter radiologically contaminated areas, collect samples and return samples for processing.  The system will aid in the observation of tactical/technical objectives and danger areas beyond the user?s Line of Sight (LOS).

The UGV will perform collection and reconnaissance tasks while permitting the operator to remain at a safe distance away (up to 10 miles) at a Ground Control Station (GCS) which may include non-LOS.  The platform should be able to conduct extended missions with duration up to 24 hours (including periods of limited visibility), traversing improved surfaces with a top speed of at least 30 kph.  If using an engine, it should use diesel fuel. The platform must be able to negotiate uneven rough terrain (such as rubble containing large blocks up to 2m x 2m x 2m) up to a 45 degree slope 16 in (41 cm) high step and be able to ford one foot of water.  Responses need to address the cant, tilt, and pan limits they can support.  The UGV should incorporate semi-autonomous driving utilizing such functions as way-point following and obstacle avoidance.  The UGV must be able to communicate with the GCS to receive commands, give status, send data and video images, and record site location with GPS coordinates.

The UGV will use a modular configuration and be capable of employing various sample collection and detection/identification systems.  As such, the UGV must have a manipulator arm with at least five (5) degrees of freedom, to include push-pull, capable of lifting 100 lbs, operate semi-autonomously (i.e., pre-programmed and user-defined poses), and have a universal tool holder in the gripper.  The UGV must have the capability of transporting 7-10 chunk debris samples weighing up to two kilograms (2 kg) each with a volume of approximately 25 cubic inches, be able to collect 7-10 fine particulate debris samples weighing 20 grams via vacuum samplers,  and collect 7-10 smear samples.

The system should be inherently simple to use, survivable, durable, multi-functional and easily transportable by air and truck.  As part of its survivability, the UGV needs to be able to operate in a radiologically contaminated area with reasonable protection and able to be decontaminated.  Responses should address refit operations such as resupply and handing off the cargo.

DTRA will review responses that meet the requirements of a complete system or strictly the mobility/platform portion allowing DTRA the option of later adding components.

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas.  Responses are to be limited to no more than five pages.  Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, CAGE code, DUNS Number, business size, and small business classification (8(a), HUBZone, etc.), if applicable.  Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.   

Responses shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm EDT on 13 April 2007.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged, and shall be submitted to Ms. Elizabeth Braxton at elizabeth.braxton@dtra.mil.  Non-electronic responses, though not preferred, may be submitted via facsimile to 703.767.4441 to the attention of Ms. Elizabeth Braxton.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  

Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Ship Propulsion and Power Systems
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research and Naval Sea Systems Command are issuing a Request for Information (RFI) and scheduling an Industry Workshop to fulfill the requirements set forth below.  The Chief of Naval Operations has directed the Naval Sea Systems Command to evaluate the Navy need for emerging Integrated Power System technologies and to guide the development and transition of technology to the fleet.  The Navy has developed and is in the process of deploying first generation Integrated Power Systems (IPS) on numerous ships classes.  Systems include full electric propulsion, such as DDG 1000 and T-AKE, partial electric propulsion, such as LHD-8, and mechanical propulsion ships with innovative electric mission systems such as CVN 78 and SSN 23.  The Navy is in the process of issuing contracts to four shipbuilders who will work interactively to evaluate the Navy’s open system architecture for the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) and provide recommendations to maximize opportunities for common component development.  The shipbuilders will use the findings of the NGIPS Navy Working Groups and work under the Alternate Nuclear Power System (ANPS) to build upon the Navy’s architecture.   The contractor(s) will recommend changes to the Navy’s NGIPS technical architecture consisting of a functional description of a platform-independent system of power and propulsion modules suitable for application to the following Navy ship types, a surface combatant, a submarine, an expeditionary warfare ship, an aircraft carrier, and a littoral combat ship. Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEA), has chartered a Next Generation IPS (NGIPS) Flag Level Steering Board to provide guidance and oversight for NGIPS to support transformational warfighting through improved Integrated Power System technology while ensuring system commonality and the enabling of electric weapons and sensors.  This Flag board has directed that industry “buy-in” should be obtained for next generation IPS technical architectures and technology options.  The purpose of the Peer Review Team Workshop described below is to obtain industry and equipment supplier input to development of options for the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems technical architecture development.  The Office of Naval Research is gathering and evaluating information regarding current technologies and equipment, and research and development efforts underway having shipboard propulsion and power implications. Key areas of interest are energy conversion, electric propulsion, power conversion, power generation, power distribution and energy storage. This announcement requests non-proprietary concepts and data for systems and equipment that can populate Integrated Power and Weapon Systems alternative architectures.    This undertaking is expected to serve as part of the foundation for developing a roadmap for U.S. Navy propulsion power and energy science and technology and research and development. 
  
We request industry leaders and innovators across the spectrum to provide non-proprietary survey information for systems/equipment you are operating, manufacturing, or developing which could benefit the NGIPS ship technical architecture development as described.  Responses to this request for information should be submitted by March 26 in the form of a short 1-2 page white paper.  Opportunity for submission of specific proprietary information will be discussed at the workshop.
    
In addition to this request for a response for technical information, a Peer Review Team Workshop will be held on April 5-6, 2007, to allow all interested contractors, HM&E and combat system integrators and university representatives to respond to Navy-led briefings and discussions  and provide input to these NGIPS technical architecture studies in breakout sessions.  Many briefings to be presented at this event will be considered to fall under export control and  Distribution Statement "D" (Critical Technology) restrictions. Therefore only Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractor personnel who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents are authorized to attend.  The Navy’s desire is to obtain input from system integration firms and organizations possessing advanced component technology.  Any other U.S. requests shall be referred to the point of contact below.   Additional workshop information is provided below.  
  
This NGIPS Peer Review Team Workshop is scheduled for 5 and 6 April 2006 and will commence at 1200 hrs on April 5 and end at 1400 hrs on April 6.  This schedule is intended to follow the Sea-Air-Space Exposition 2007, which ends on April 5.  The location for this event is:    Alion Science and Technology Office, 1100 New Jersey Ave, SE, Washington, DC 20003.
  
Submittals:   Please fax or e mail your survey responses by March 30 to the POC noted below. Information provided in response to this RFI shall be non proprietary.  For Industry Day attendees, please call POC below to RSVP.  Please RSVP no later than 26 March, 2007.

Data Rights The Government has a requirement to provide a training simulator to the Army for the operation and maintenance of the Grader. One of the possible acquisition strategies would be to purchase Government Purpose data rights, pursuant to DFARS clause 227.7013,  from the successful offeror for their grader and provide this data to STRICOM (Command responsible for the purchase of training simulators) to provide to their training simulator contractor to develop a grader training simulator. We would price the data r ights separately. The Grader manufacturer would also need to work with the STRICOM contractor in the development of this simulator. We would also price this support effort separately. Regarding the strategy outlined above, we have the following questions: 1) Would you be willing to provide Government Purpose data rights to the Government for you grader as part of this solicitation? If not, please state specifically why not. 2) What would be your ROM for this effort? 3) Would you be willing to work with STRICOMs training simulator contractor (provide vehicle access, resolve technical questions, etc.)  as they develop the training simulator? 4) What would be your ROM for this effort? Diagnostics 1) Identify all of your system monitored mission essential fault conditions relating to the engine, transmission or hydro-static drive, hydraulics and brake systems.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District is soliciting and intends to award a construction project entitled Picatinny Arsenal Fire Station at Picatinny,  NJ. The project is being solicited as an 8(a) competitive procurement under  solicitation No. W912DS-07-B-0004.  This project includes a Brand Name Only  component.  This notification serves three purposes: (1) to notify potential  offerors of the Armys intent to award a brand name only component under a  construction project, (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the  brand name only item and (3) notification of the Armys intent to sole source a  Brand Name Only system, Nederman Magna Track® HL, as described below. The Nederman system is embedded in the construction project, which is being issued  competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring the Nederman system will be  sole source if no sources are able to provide a compatible system.  In the event no  compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued  pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.  This Notice of intent is for  planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This Notice of intent is the only  document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the governments  intent. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:   Fire trucks at Picatinny are currently equipped with exhaust nozzles that are  affixed to the Nederman Magna Track® HL.  The system proposed shall meet the  following requirement, 10 HP, 3500 RPM, TEFC Motor, Static Pressure 6 WG, Electric  208-230/3/60 and must provide the magnetic starter and local safety disconnect  switch.  The exhaust fan and associated system must be capable of receiving radio  frequency from the emergency vehicles at an FCC approved frequency of LLB4712. The  FCC approved transmitter frequency shall serve to act as a remote control for the  fan start up to ensure that the exhaust system is always running whenever the  emergency vehicle is in operation. This Notice of intent requests that any vendor wishing to provide information on a  system that is compatible with the Nederman nozzle affixed to the rescue vehicles  should provide a copy of its brochure and any other pertinent technical data.   Responses should include: (1) A technical description on the vendors vertical hose  having the capacity to achieve a 100% exhaust extraction from the vehicle nozzle.  The nozzle should slip off smoothly when the electromagnet is automatically switched  off as the vehicle passes through the door. This concept and configuration should  stay in position during the travel of the vehicle within the fire station. The  system shall meet the above identified technical requirements. All interested vendors should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by 28  March 2007, 02:00pm local time.

This is NOT a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a  result of this notice or to pay for any information received. This Notice of intent  neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it  restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.

PLEASE DO NOT BID IF YOU CAN NOT MEET THE DELIVERY REQUIREMENT<BR><BR>The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the following equipment: 		Part #		Description 8435	Tandberg RDX External Drive Chassis 8415		Exabyte/Tandberg 120GB Removable Disk Cartridge D-412S	JetStor 12-Bay Array EA833AA	Hewlett Packard NetXtreme Gigabit NIC The Department is moving in the direction of using frequent, local, disk-based snapshots for quick recovery of lost or damaged files or e-mails, which will reduce the need for off-site transport of backups for disaster recovery purposes (as required in 12 FAM 622.3).  The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose is over $1700 per drive, and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare, at a cost of nearly $7,000 plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier (around $300) and a removable drive (also roughly $300 for the same capacity as tapes).  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as key components of the Department’s enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>

Department of Healt and Human Services
Subpart 353.2 ? Provisions and Clauses

Sec.
   352.202-1 	Definitions. ( Jan 2006)
   352.215-1 	Instructions to offerors--Competitive acquisition.
   352.215-70 	Late proposals and revisions. (Jan 2006)

(4) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.216-22, but it doesn't state an estimated level of effort for this indefinite quantity contract (so that adequate planning for dedicated staff can be made) or any minimum and maximum quantities.
 
Thus, what is the estimated number of labor hours contemplated by your requirement for a particular period (i.e., for the base year of seven months and for each of the two one-year options of twelve months each)?
 
Is there a minimum and maximum?

Response:   

The workload here is variable so setting the min/max would be difficult.  The contractor would have the ability to say he/she/they are too busy to take on a particular review assignment.  There may be other times when there is no work for a short period.  It depends on what documents are submitted to the Agency for review.  What we'd like to know from respondents is what they would propose as the hourly rate, which would be doing the work and what they would see as the level of effort along with any restrictions.  In the previous contracts,  16 hours per week was used as the proposed aggregate level of effort. 


Consequently, there is no definitive estimate available for the quantity of services to be performed under this contract.  Delivery and performance will be done at the direction of the Project Officer.  There is no minimum or maximum.  Once a contractor is selected, a purchase order specifying a not to exceed amount will be issued to the contractor.
 
(5) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.217-9.  There are several places in that clause for entries by the government.  
 
Can you advise as to what these entries should be in the clause's paras. (a) and (c)?
 
Response: (a)  30 days;  30 days:  (c) 2 years 7 months ( Base period of 7 months and 2 option years).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with SUNAIR Electronics Inc., 3005 S.W. Third Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33315 to provide: (1) Upgrades to at least 95 current Sunair RT-9000 transceivers from version A to version B, (2) Upgrades to at least 95 current remote control units RCU-9310 from version A to version B, and (3) At least 25 additional RT-9000 version B, RCU-9310 version B and CU-9125 radios. The proposed acquisition will be for one (1) base year with two (2) one-year options. 

In 1997, USCG began a multi-year effort to re-capitalize and modernize all shore-based and shipboard low power HF radios. In 2000, through a full and open competition, Sunair Electronics Inc. was awarded a five-year contract to supply USCG with the low power HF radios. Along with additional purchases,  the current radios need to be upgraded in order to meet the new technology requirements called the Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) and only Sunair Electronics Inc. can provide the upgrades as well as the proprietary software for current and future support. Acquiring the upgrades from another vendor would not be cost effective, since there would be proprietary information involved.  Without these upgrades, there is the danger of miscommunication between the USCG command centers and the USCG ships out in the sea. 

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334220. Delivery will be made to the United States Coast Guard Engineering and Logistic Center (ELC), Baltimore MD.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  All capability statements received by 3:00 PM EST on 21 March 2007 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296.

    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
The contractor shall provide fifteen (15) Gage, Rain, Tipping Bucket, Frise Engineering Model #7405, Belfort Model #5-405 standard with Tripod.  Units measuring tube and stick mechanically measures rainfall in 0.01-inch increments, transmits electrical impulse for each increment.  NSN # 6660-00-242-7093, ASN D120.  Items shall be delivered in accordance with NWS special packaging/marking requirement (see attachment A).

SCOPE:
The tipping-bucket rain gage covered by this specification shall be capable of transmitting by electrical means the rate and accumulated amounts of rain fall data to a station recorder.  The rain gage will be located in an exposed outdoor environment.  The tipping-bucket consists of a two-compartment mechanism mounted inside a circular housing.  Rainwater falling into an upper funnel accumulates in one of the two tipping bucket compartments until 0.01 inches (18.53 grams) of water is collected.  The weight of the water causes the bucket to tip on its pivots emptying into a lower funnel.  The rainwater from the lower funnel can be collected into a measuring cylinder whenever the Petcock located at the base of the lower funnel is opened.  The water in the cylinder is measured with a rain gage measuring stick.  The motion of the tipping-bucket momentarily actuates a mercury switch, which is connected to a 24 VAC, 60Hz supply, permitting an electrical impulse to be sent to a recording unit located in a Weather Forecasting Office (WFO).  The recorder, therefore, reads out each time 0.01 inches of water is accumulated.

Major Components:
The tipping-bucket rain gage shall consist of the following major components:  collector and funnel assembly, housing assembly, cylinder retainer assembly, frame and tipping-bucket assembly, tripod support, measuring tube, and measuring stick.

Measuring stick:
A 24-inch lamicoid No. 6021 plastic stick, graduated, shall be furnished with each rain gage.  Throughout the course of production the lower end of the stick shall always be square and even and indicate an accurate measured reading of 0.01 inch of linear length for the first graduation mark.

Workmanship:
Material and workmanship shall be of the best quality and conform to accepted engineering practices.  All material used shall be new and unused.

Performance:
The capacity of the tipping bucket for a single tip (.01-inch of rain) when accurately weighed, shall be 18.53 grams.  The tipping-bucket shall be tested with the frame level and at a uniform rate of water flow from a spout with an opening of ¼ inch in cross section.  The spout shall be directed vertically downward into the tipping bucket and located directly over the line of axis of rotation about which the bucket tips.  The tipping catch in one chamber of the tipping-bucket shall be equal to within 10% of the tipping catch in the second chamber.

A check for accuracy of tips shall be made at two (2) rates.  The first check shall be made at a two (2) tips per minute rate and a second check made at a 10 tips per minute rate.  Catch shall be measured on a balance accurate to +/- .05 gram.  Performance when checked at the rate of two (2) tips per minute for 10 tips shall be accurate to +/- 2% (+/ 3.7 grams) and when checked at the rate of 10 tips per minute for 10 tips, error shall not be greater than +7% (+12.97 grams).  Optimum operation shall have tipping buckets adjusted with zero at 2 tips per minute and +6% error at 10 tips per minute.

The water deposited into the measuring cylinder from the tipping bucket shall be accurate to within 0.01 inch (18.5 gram) of equivalent rainfall for any measurement taken.  A check for this required accuracy shall be made at three (3) levels, 0.10 inch (185.3 grams), 0.50 inch (926-5 grams), and 0.90 inch (1667.7 grams).  The catch shall be measured on a scale accurate to +/- 0.05 grams.

Finish:
The inner and outer surface of the tipping bucket shall be smooth and clean and shall not be treated or lacquered.  Other surfaces of the rain gage that are exposed directly to the weather and action of water, including the collector and upper funnel, shall be thoroughly cleaned and finished with a high grade aluminum lacquer.  An acceptable finish is Sherwin-William Aluminum Lacquer No. M60Sl or equivalent                                            .

Nameplate:
Each unit shall have a nameplate permanently affixed with rivets or screws and located on the outer side of the door assembly.  Each unit shall be numbered consecutively starting at one (1) proceeded by a dash and two digits representing the fiscal year (e.g. an order of 10 units purchased in fiscal year 2006, 06-1 through 06-10).

Physical:
All seams and beadings shall be water tight.  Brazed and soldered joints shall be tightly bonded.  All seams, beading and joints when exposed to water action shall be completely free of any water leaks.

It shall be possible to interchange tipping bucket assemblies with tipping bucket frames, although the accuracy required shall be obtained with calibrated matching frame and bucket.

Guarantee:
Each rain gage with all of its related parts shall be guaranteed against faulty materials and workmanship for a period of one (1) year after installation and activation, but shall not exceed two (2) years after inspection and acceptance of the last system delivered under the purchase order.  If a rain gage fails to perform satisfactorily due to faulty materials or workmanship, it shall be repaired or replaced by the contractor at no additional cost to the Government.

Preproduction Model:
If required in the bid invitation, a preproduction model shall be provided that has been fabricated with production tooling.  The preproduction model shall be identical to those items that shall be provided for the production order.  Approval of the preproduction model shall not be construed as a waiver of any specific requirement.  An approved preproduction model will be accepted as a partial delivery under this purchase order.  A rejected preproduction model shall be returned at the contractor’s expense.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order the contractor shall be responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified, the contractor may utilize his own facilities or any commercial laboratory acceptable to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure that the rain gage conforms to prescribed requirements.

The system inspection will consist of the following tests:
a)	Inspect all castings to see that they are smooth and free from sand holes, burrs, and sharp edges.
b)	Test the tipping bucket and mercury switch assembly for smooth operation.
c)	Test the mercury switch to observe that its operation is not erratic and that it closes once for each tip and does not generate multiple closures for a single tip.
d)	Inspect the surfaces of the tipping bucket to see that they are clean, smooth, and untreated.
e)	Test the tipping bucket for water leaks.  Check each compartment in turn by filling it to the rim and observing it for leaks for a period of 30 minutes.
f)	Test the measuring cylinder for leaks by filling it to the rim and observing it for a period of 30 minutes.
g)	Test the lower funnel for leaks.  With the drain Petcock closed, pour one half (1/2) of the measuring cylinder of water into the lower funnel assembly and observe it for leaks for a period of 30 minutes.
h)	Inspect all surfaces required to be lacquered to see that they have been thoroughly cleaned prior to being finished with aluminum lacquer.  The finished surfaces shall be free from bubbles, cracks, runs, insufficient coverage, and peeling.
i)	Test for interchangeability of tipping buckets and tipping bucket frames.

The precision of the tipping bucket rain gage (i.e., the precision with which the measurements for a fixed value is repeated several times) shall satisfy the required accuracy as described herein.

PREPARATON FOR DELIVERY
Each rain gage shall be preserved and packaged for mechanical and physical protection in accordance with best commercial practice.  Each rain gage shall be adequately cushioned, blocked, and braced as required to afford maximum protection fro hazards normally encountered in storage and transit via common carrier.

Any damage occurring to the rain gage during shipment, that is due to improper packaging, shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  The rain gage shall be repaired or replaced by the contractor at no additional expense to the Government.

Each shipping container shall be appropriately marked on the exterior surface to identify the name of the contractor, the NOAA-NWS contract number and the type and serial number of the rain gage contained therein.  This identification shall be placed on the top and one side of the container.

NWS Special Packaging / Marking requirement will be strictly enforced.

<CONTACT>Roberta Richardson, Contract Specialist , Phone 301-827-7175, Fax 301-827-7106, Email roberta.richardson@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate additional clauses, provide a summary response to all questions, and to change the response date to 14 Jan 2007, 400 PM EST.  FDA-SOL-0700148(a) is a reposting of FDA SOL-07-00148 that due to a date problem was inadvertently archived in FBO.  FDA-SOL-07-00148(a) recreated the initial posting and responded to questions submitted for FDA-SOL-07-00148.

This amendment responds to the most recent questions and includes questions / responses submitted earlier.

(1) QUESTION:  What is the  minimum level of clearance that you require?  That is, do you require "Confidential" or "Secret" or "Top Secret" or some other classification entitled ____________________?
 
RESPONSE:  The categories  "Confidential" or "Secret" or "Top Secret" refer to DOD / Militatry security classifications.  The FDA uses "Personnel Security Requirements" and does not use the DOD classifications.  Clearances are usually held by those having Individuals who have undergone fingerprinting and had a successful a background investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The FDA background investigation policy applies to all positions including: 

Students, Interns, Contractors,, Guest Workers, Visiting Scientists, Visiting Associate, Temporary Employees, Special Government Employees and Volunteers. 

You can find out more information on clearance requirements / security forms(SF 85 and SF 85P) on the link below.

www.opm.gov/forms

(2) QUESTION:  Even though it has been published, FAC 2005-15 is not effective until February 12, 2007.  Do you require it now nevertheless
RESPONSE:  Yes. Feb 1 07 was the anticipated award date.  However, the solicitation indicated that the dates could change.  The anticipated award date is mid-late February.

(3) QUESTION:   The questions and answers posted on January 8, 2007 state that you'll be amending the solicitation.  When will you actually be amending the solicitation and what will the new closing date be?
RESPONSE:
On Mon 1/8/2007 12:25PM, a memo was sent to all respondednts indicating that the original solicitation FDA-SOL-07-00148 had been accidentally archived.  the same memo responded to all questions and provided FDA-SOL-07-00148 (a) as the new solicitation posted on FBO.  Additionally, FDA-SOL-07-00148(a) indicated that it's intent was to respond to all questions and act as an amendment to FDA-SOL-07-00148.  Additionally, this amendment dated 11 Jan 07 incorporates all changes, clause updates and responds to all questions submitted.  The response date has been changed to 14 Jan 04, 4:00PM EST.

The date for submitting questions has passed.

Earlier Questions / Responses:

Response:  Yes

Contractors name:
Response:  J. Dawson

Contract number:  
Response:  HHSF223200530231P

Date, expiration date and value. 
Response:  Effective date 7/13/2005 to present
Value: $61,950

Additional questions / responses:

 (1)  Under the heading "Qualifications," the solicitation requires "Current and Active Clearance to see confidential and proprietary information."
 
By this, do you mean that the person performing the work must possess a U.S. Government security clearance (i.e., either Confidential, Secret or Top Secret) OR do you mean that the person must simply possess a demonstrated ability to see, handle, process and protect confidential and proprietary business information, but not possess a formal government security clearance?
 
Response:  the individual performing the work must have a current and valid clearance from a Federal Government agency.


(2)  Do you require the CONTRACTOR (i.e., the firm to which you make the award) to also have whatever the above qualification is, or is your requirement sufficiently satisfied if the person actually doing the work has it?     
 
Response:  Only the individual performing the work is required to have the specified qualifications and  clearance.

(3)  The solicitation states that the incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12, dated Aug. 4, 2006.  There have been two additional FAC's, numbered 2005-13 and 2005-14, which were effective on September 28, 2006 and November 22, 2006, respectively.  
 
Will you amend the solicitation to incorporate these last two FAC's, or should these two simply be disregarded?

Response:  The solicitation will be amended to include the latest FACs through 2005-15 dated Dec 12, 2006.  The amendment will also include the following Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations ( 48CFR, Vol71, No. 244) as published in the Federal Register Dec 20, 2006.
 
Department of Healt and Human Services
Subpart 353.2 ? Provisions and Clauses

Sec.
   352.202-1 	Definitions. ( Jan 2006)
   352.215-1 	Instructions to offerors--Competitive acquisition.
   352.215-70 	Late proposals and revisions. (Jan 2006)
   352.224-70 	Confidentiality of information.  
   352.232-9 	Withholding of contract payments.  (Jan 2006) 
   352.249-14 	Excusable delays. (Jan 2006)
    352.270-5 	Key personnel.
    352.270-11  Privacy Act (Jan 2006)
352.270-13	Tobacco Free Facilities (Jan 2006)
   

(4) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.216-22, but it doesn't state an estimated level of effort for this indefinite quantity contract (so that adequate planning for dedicated staff can be made) or any minimum and maximum quantities.
 
Thus, what is the estimated number of labor hours contemplated by your requirement for a particular period (i.e., for the base year of seven months and for each of the two one-year options of twelve months each)?
 
Is there a minimum and maximum?

Response:   

The workload here is variable so setting the min/max would be difficult.  The contractor would have the ability to say he/she/they are too busy to take on a particular review assignment.  There may be other times when there is no work for a short period.  It depends on what documents are submitted to the Agency for review.  What we'd like to know from respondents is what they would propose as the hourly rate, which would be doing the work and what they would see as the level of effort along with any restrictions.  In the previous contracts,  16 hours per week was used as the proposed aggregate level of effort. 


Consequently, there is no definitive estimate available for the quantity of services to be performed under this contract.  Delivery and performance will be done at the direction of the Project Officer.  There is no minimum or maximum.  Once a contractor is selected, a purchase order specifying a not to exceed amount will be issued to the contractor.
 
(5) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.217-9.  There are several places in that clause for entries by the government.  
 
Can you advise as to what these entries should be in the clause's paras. (a) and (c)?
 
Response: (a)  30 days;  30 days:  (c) 2 years 7 months ( Base period of 7 months and 2 option years).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective vendors.

1)	Question: Must the 16 array transducers be aligned, axially with respect to each other?  
ANSWER: The requirement is to deliver a vertical line array that meets the technical specification in section 2.1. The degree of misalignment (off axis) is not specified, but shall be identified if it is on the order of 4cm or more. A stiffness member is not required to hold the array transducers in line. 
  
2)	Question: If deployment and retrieval require a chute will the one built for the previous Source-Receive array be available for use, or must a new one be priced? 
ANSWER: Yes, there will be one available for use. 
 
3)	Question: Does the ASRA computer record acoustic data continuously for 36 hours except during the 40% of the time it is transmitting waveforms; or is the system turned off at times and if so, for how many hours?
ANSWER: Section 2.4.2.b of the specifications requires the ASRAS computer to record data continuously, on demand, or via a schedule until the hard disk space is full.  

4)	Question:  When used in the surface buoy configuration, are the FFT’s computed by the ASRA computer transferred to the shipboard interface over the Wireless LAN?
ANSWER:  Yes. 

5)	Question:  Would an architecture that located the ASRA EM underwater, near the array, (similar to the ACDS SSU) be acceptable?
ANSWER:  Section 2.3, requires that it shall be a separable part of the shipboard interface unit or contained within the optional surface buoy.

6)	Question: In section 6.0, when performing the operational test of the ASRA system, is the boat GFE? 
ANSWER:  The operational test shall be performed at the offeror's manufacturing facility.

7)	Question: In Section 2.1, paragraph 2 mentions that each transducer shall be Omni directional. Is that in both the horizontal and vertical planes? 
ANSWER:  Yes

8)	Question: In paragraph 2.4.1.a. What is the dynamic range of the arbitrary waveforms? 
ANSWER:  Signal generation is specified as 14 bits minimum in 2.4.1.a, which is 84 dB min.

9)	Question: What is the anticipated start date of the program? 
ANSWER:  To Be Determined

10)	 Question:  What type of contract is expected to result from this acquisition?

<DESC>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RECEIVED BEFORE MARCH 5, 2007 AT 10:00 A.M., IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SOLICITATION REQUIREMENT.

1.	Will printing costs for photographs be billed separately beyond the Firm Fixed Price?

ANSWER:  NO

2. Will the cost of the prints that are delivered to agencies other than the OPA be billed directly to those agencies or through the OPA?

ANSWER:  All costs associated with the contract will be priced under the CLINS.

3.	 If the Firm Fixed Price does include printing costs can you give us any idea of the print output both size and quantity (estimated) or taken from previous years contract.

ANSWER:  There are no previous contracts.  All applicable standard sizes and any volume based discounts should be included based on the Performance Work Statement in Amendment One Attachment B and the Workload Data in Amendment One Attachment C.  

4.	Re: RFP/Evaluation Method/Factor 1 states, ?Performance Requirements Summary for a phase-in and phase-out plan.?  Does the government require a PRS only for phase-in and phase-out plan, or for the whole performance period, including phase-in and phase-out?

ANSWER:  The Performance Requirements Summary will be required for a Phase-In, Phase-Out, and for the performance period of the contract.

5.	Re: RFP/Evaluation Method/Factor 1 says, ?The Government will utilize the Performance Requirements Summary to incorporate a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan after award.?  Does this mean that no Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is required as part of the service provider bid?

ANSWER:  No Quality Surveillance Assurance Plan is required as part of the service provider bid.

6.	Re: RFP/Provisions/Factor 1/Technical approach states, ?Technical approach shall not exceed two pages shall not exceed two pages each.?  We understand this to mean that each of the following requirements has a separate two-page limit: the Cost Reduction Plan, Transition Management Plan, and Performance Requirements Summary plan.  Is this correct? 
ANSWER:  Yes, this is correct.

7.	Re: Attachment A/Response to Questions, question 2b.  The government answered that the provider is not required to travel.  However, to calculate workload on preparation performed for travel, providers need an estimate of number of trips they will be required to provide advance market research for.  

ANSWER:  The number of times that would be contracted out for a photographer would average at the most once per month, probably less.  Currently, OPA press staff takes photos when the Secretary travels.  For international trips, photographers are obtained through the embassy.

8.  Re: Attachment B/General Requirements, bullet 3: ?Provide photography-related services such as providing reprints and enlargements, editing/color correcting services, and creating master photo CDs.?  Could the government provide workload data so that providers can have a basis on which to calculate costs for retouching, reprints, enlargements, etc.?   

ANSWER:  Workload Data has been provided on Amendment One Attachment C of the Solicitation.  This is a performance based fixed price contract.

9.  Alternatively, it may be more appropriate to consider additional CLINS for a la carte (reimbursable) pricing off a rate sheet for these services?

ANSWER:  Workload Data has been provided on Amendment One Attachment C of the Solicitation.  This is a performance based fixed price contract.

10.	This question refers to two requirements.   Re: Attachment B/Performance Requirements, bullet 3 states that DOC photographs for the website ?must be electronically sent to the webmaster within two hours of assignment completion.?  Bullet 4 then states that ?Digital photos and CDs with photos for the website shall be provided to the customer within two business hours of completion of the assignment.? 

ANSWER:  Corrected PWS Performance Requirements Bullet Number 3 is changed to read as follows:  ?Photographs for the Department of Commerce website sent to the webmaster and or customer within two business hours of the completion of the assignment.  OPA will work with photographic services on which photos shall be posted to the website.?  Delete PWS Performance Requirements Bullet Number 4 ?Digital photos and CDs with photos for the website shall be sent to the customer within two business hours of completion of the assignment.?


11.  According to professional standards of photography, editing, red eye correction, color correction, cropping, and general cleanup of photographs is necessary before the digital photos are saved in low-resolution format to a CD to be delivered to the customer for posting to a website, or the further selection of images to be printed.  Therefore, if the government expects these standard professional practices from these deliverables, a two-hour window from the time an assignment is completed to delivery of the CD with photographs is not realistic.  (Even more so in cases when an assignment is off-site and produces hundreds of photographs, or there are several assignments in one day).  

Would the government be willing to change the requirement to a 1-2 business day turnaround?

ANSWER:  We specify that photos other than those for the website (proofs, enlargements, portraits, CDs) shall be provided within 3-5 business days after the completion of the assignment.


12. CONCERN: Alternately, is the government willing to accept un-edited and un-retouched photographs that do not adhere to professional standards?  Note that for the latter option, the web-master and each customer would need to acquire the appropriate software and hardware to be able to properly view high-resolution photographs, since there would not be time to create low-resolution photographs.  

ANSWER:  NO.

13.  Also, will the above requirements include images from outside entities, i.e. photographs taken by outside photographers during the Secretary?s international travels?

ANSWER:  Currently, photos for international travel are contracted out through the embassy or Foreign Commercial Service.  The Service Provider will not be responsible for this.


14.	Re: Attachment B/Constraints, bullet 9 defines market research and provides instructions as to locating a professional photographer.  Could the government clarify or define which General Requirement or Performance Requirement that this Constraint refers to?

ANSWER:  This refers to the Performance Work Statement General Requirements Bullet Number 7.

15.	Re: Attachment B/GFP, the government lists ?Camera, still picture? as one of the pieces of furnished property.  Does this refer to one camera or multiple cameras?  Does it refer to still (film) cameras of various formats and/or digital cameras and lenses, flash equipment and other accessories? 

ANSWER:  Please refer to the ANSWER to Question Number 20. 

16.	Re: Attachment B/GFP, does the government intend to furnish studio lights and accessories?

ANSWER:  The Government intends to provide the use of an onsite studio with lights and accessories for official use only.  Please refer to the Performance Work Statement General Requirements Bullet Number 9 and Constraints Bullet Number 8.

17.	Does the government MEO has access to the information regarding the grade levels of authorized billets of the operation being studied?
 
ANSWER:  One GS 14, One GS 13, One GS 07, and One GS 12.

a)     If so, doesn?t publishing this information ?level the playing field? between the MEO and commercial contractors?  This would be the first A-76 study in which we have participated wherein this information was not provided.  In the past, this data was deemed important to bidders when the Government personnel have the right of first refusal.  We therefore request this data.

ANSWER:  Provided under question 17.

18.	Will a site visit be made available, so that commercial bidders can evaluate the working environment & equipment condition already known to the MEO?

ANSWER: YES.  A site will be available for one viewing purposes only.  NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED.  Please contact Mr. David Carter, by calling 202-482-1966, for access to the site for Thursday, March 15, 2007, 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST.

19.	The descriptions of the GFE provided in Attachment B is so minimal that is impossible to evaluate the need and extent to which a bidder must supplement or replace it.  
a)     What is the make and model of each item listed?  b)  How many of each item are available?  c)      How many still cameras are available and are they film or digital?  d)     What accessories are available for each camera?
e)     Studio Lighting Equipment: Are units available and if so, how many?

20.	Does the Government provide any supplies, or is the contractor required to provide all of it?

ANSWER:  No.  In accordance with the Performance Work Statement General Requirements, The service provider shall:  Bullet Number 1 reads, ?Provide all personnel, facilities, materials, supplies, equipment and services required for the performance of work in this PWS, which are not provided by the Government.?


a)     If it is the contractor?s responsibility please provide the usage of all items, as this is information already available to the MEO; again to level the playing field.
