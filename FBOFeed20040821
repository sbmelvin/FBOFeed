<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Air Modeling Division, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, has a requirement for services in support of the Implementation of a System to Estimate Wildland Fire Emissions for NOAA’s Air Quality Forecast Modeling System.  The requirements for this service are as follows:  (1) Perform a survey of readily-available, real-time wildland fire emission databases.  Strong consideration shall be given to the ABBA database, which is being used for the HYSPLIT modeling effort (http://www.arl.noaa.gov/smoke/forecast.html).  Provide a written assessment of the assumptions used in translating the satellite imagery into an emissions estimate.  Deliver a written recommendation on the database to be used for real-time forecasts.  (2) After the appropriate database has been approved by the NOAA project officer, the contractor shall develop and successfully test computer scripts for ingesting the data on a real-time basis.  (3) Modify the emissions portion of the PREMAQ preprocessing module to provide for the following features: (a) updated speciation factors, (b) updated plume rise calculations, and (c) resolved vertical allocation.  The modified computer code shall be furnished to NOAA for final integration into the PREMAQ system.  (4) Provide gridded wildland fire emission estimates from the modified emissions code for up to three two-week episodes from 2002 and 2003.  These estimates will be used by NOAA to assess performance of the ETA-CMAQ modeling system.  These episodes shall be selected on the basis of fire frequency, fire intensity, and the likelihood that wildland fires contribute to reduced air quality in the eastern United States.  (5) Provide support and make necessary modifications of the wildland fire emissions software during two-weeks of real-time testing with a developmental version of the ETA-CMAQ modeling system.  (6) Prepare and deliver a written report describing the emissions processing system and the steps that were taken in testing the system.
In performing these tasks, the contractor shall be aware of a closely-related EPA-funded effort to integrate the BlueSky module into the SMOKE emissions system.  It is anticipated that BlueSky will provide a framework for computing hourly, gridded emission estimates from wildland fires using updated emission factors and fuel characteristics data.  This EPA-funded effort, however, does not rely on the use of real-time satellite imagery.  The framework, if successfully deployed in a retrospective version of CMAQ, might be adaptable for future version of the CMAQ-ETA system to improve the technical basis for wildland fire emission estimates.

Delivery dates:
Recommendation of database – 4 weeks after start of project
Script development – 8 weeks after start of project
Modification of emissions software– 10 weeks after start of project
Retrospective test of emissions – 12 weeks after start of project
Support of emissions during a real-time test of a developmental version of ETA-CMAQ – 16 weeks after start of project
Draft final report – 20 weeks after start of project
Delivery of final report, computer software, and scripts – 24 weeks after start of project

Period of Performance: September 29, 2003 through September 28, 2005
All responsible sources may submit an offer to the RFQ which will be considered by the agency.  Copies of the solicitation will only be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.  Telephone request will not be honored.  Submit a copy of the downloable RFQ, provide sufficient supportive technical/description literature with proposal, via email to (sybil.s.custer@noaa.gov) or mail offers to DOC/NOAA/EASC Acquisition Management Division, 200 Granby Street, Suite 815, Norfolk, Virginia 23510, NO LATER THAN September 3, 2004.  Potential contractors must register in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) to be eligible for award.  The CCR website is www.ccr.gov.  Award will be made to the lowest responsible, responsive offeror who can meet the requirements contained in this announcement and is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and other price related factors.  Award will be made on or about September 15, 2004.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS prepared by the National Park Service in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation No Q5100040009  is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and will be awarded as single award contract .  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541930 the size standard is 6.0 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-05. The solicitation item is as follows: Location:  Andersonville National Historic Site-a unit of the National Park Service, 496 Cemetery Road, Andersonville, Georgia 31711 Background/Purpose & Project Description: Andersonville National Historic Site was established by the United States Congress on October 16, 1970 (84 Stat. 989).  The site was established to provide an understanding of Civil War prison camps and to "interpret the role of prisoner of war camps in history" and "to commemorate the sacrifice of Americans who lost their lives in such camps."  An oral history project was begun during the early 1990s to record for posterity the story of our nation's prisoners of war. In order to preserve the experiences of American prisoners of war, Andersonville NHS (ANDE) staff began recording oral history interviews with former prisoners of war during the early 1990s.  Presently, the park possesses 906 interviews with former prisoners of war from World War I through the 1991 Persian Gulf War.  The interviews are in various formats including reel-to-reel, s-vhs, vhs and mini-dvc).     These oral history interviews will prove immeasurably valuable to ANDE in the areas of museum interpretation, visitor outreach and ongoing research programs.  They will also be an invaluable tool for educators, researchers and families of former POWs.    The interview recordings themselves will not be usable in and of themselves, however.  In order for NPS historians, interpreters, archivists and others to make full use of the information contained in these interviews, the interviews must be formatted as written transcripts. Completed transcripts funded by this project will be placed in the library of the National Prisoner of War Museum. Scope of Work: This project will entail transcription of up to 400 audio and/or video oral history interviews.  For all interviews, including those originally recorded on video, the contractor will be provided with a standard audiocassette duplicate of the interview recording for transcription.  It is expected that the interview transcripts will average 25 double spaced pages, for a total of 10,000 pages (400 interviews x 25 pages per interview).   The contractor will transcribe the audio interviews using Microsoft Word software and will submit electronic copies of the transcripts for editing by NPS historians.   Transcripts should follow standard professional oral history guidelines.  Each should be formatted as follows: double spaced, 12-point, Times New Roman font, with standard margins. Materials to be Provided by NPS NPS shall provide the following: 1. An index of persons interviewed with correct spellings. 2.    A list of prisoner of war camps for World War II and Vietnam.  Alan Marsh, Cultural Resources Program Manager at Andersonville National Historic Site, will serve as the project coordinator. Protection of Information All information and documentation gathered or produced by the contractor during the course of this work shall be held in strictest confidence and shall be fully protected from access by unauthorized persons.   The following FAR provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-02 Evaluation of Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-03 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items FAR 52.212-04, Contract Terms and Conditions-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-05, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities FAR 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, FAR 52.225-11 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases FAR 52.232-34 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor  Liability Insurance-Department of Interior 1452.228-70 EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS: The Government will award to the responsible offeror based on 1.
