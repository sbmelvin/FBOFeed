<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**IMPORTANT NOTICE**</span></strong> SOLICITATION NUMBER FOR REGIONAL ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (RE&amp;C) HAS CHANGED<br /><br />KEYWORD: FA8903-14-RFI_AFCEC_REC_Construction_IDIQ TO <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FA8903-15-R-0002 <br /><br /></span>FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING DRAFT SOLICITATION. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.<br /><br />1.</strong> This pre-solicitation notice is being updated for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback concerning DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) information. Response to the request for questions is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a Final Solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. The request is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> This requirement is to provide a full range of construction and engineering activities necessary to design, construct new facilities and, infrastructure, repair, renovate, and/or restore existing facilities. In some instances, AFCEC will be requiring work in remote and/or austere locations. The RE&amp;C contract is not intended to do stand-alone environmental contracting. The RE&amp;C program includes Design-Build (D-B), Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B), Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF&amp;E) procurement and installation approaches. The Contractor may provide support for environmental work incidental to construction efforts.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>3.</strong> This is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price (FFP) related to Regional Engineering and Construction (RE&amp;C) Multiple Award contract. The Government intends to award approximately six to eight (6-8) contracts for each of the three regions with a program ceiling of $930M. The RFP will include provisions for awarding a 100% SB set-aside with reserves for the following SB sub-categories for each region: Three to four (3-4) SB awards, one to two (1-2) 8(a) awards, one (1) HUBZone award, and one (1) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) award. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more, or no awards based upon the quality and quantity of proposals received. <br /><br /><strong>4.</strong> All questions/comments pertaining to the DRAFT RFP shall be provided to the Government for consideration in the provided matrix excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet has a field for Section/Attachment Number, Applicable Region, Page # / Paragraph Reference and Question/Comment. Please ensure that both sheets and fields are completed in their entirety. <br /><br />The Government is requesting industry input on our proposed teaming approach as described in Section L, paragraph 2.1.4. Should you have any comments/questions with this approach please address in required excel matrix spreadsheet.<br /><br />Also, the government is requesting industry input on the home/field labor categories (reference Attachment L-12) to ensure that your team (prime and/or teaming partners) will be able to provide a proposed rate for each category. The government's concern is we do not want to cause an offeror to break from their standard accounting practices and propose on a category that is covered within your Overhead costs.<br /><br /><strong>5.</strong> Request for Questions: The Government anticipates a final solicitation to be released in Dec 2014; however, this is subject to change depending on the amount of questions we receive. This notification is provided to allow early review of DRAFT solicitation documentation for this requirement. Questions concerning the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) and attachments are <strong>due by</strong> <strong>4:00 PM CT on 22 Oct 2014</strong> at <a href="mailto:afcec.re_c.contract@us.af.mil">afcec.re_c.contract@us.af.mil</a> <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>**NOTE: Due to changes in the acquisition strategy all previous questions submitted have been overcome by events and will not receive a response. Therefore, please submit all questions (previously asked or new) in response to this posting. <br /><br /></strong>Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Beatrice Torres and Contract Specialist, Ms. Diane Sanchez at <a href="mailto:afcec.re_c.contract@us.af.mil">afcec.re_c.contract@us.af.mil</a> <br /><br /><br /><strong>MISCELLANEOUS:<br /></strong>The Key Milestones Dates for Regional Engineering &amp; Construction (RE&amp;C) have been updated as of 07 Oct 2014 (Schedule information is subject to change without notice).

A Feasibility Study is required to evaluate the individual characteristics of the total water system and the feasibility of implementing the recommended approach and to provide necessary consultation and recommendations during the design phase.  The Feasibility Study shall include an ample number of new sampling points to determine optimum injection point(s), including: distal points, faucets, mixing valves, areas of high water usage, and other high risk areas for patients. The A/E shall also consider and evaluate other potential bacteria sources such as the ice machines, UD decorative fountains (if operating) , both DD and UD swimming pools.
The A/E shall also consider and evaluate the potential impact of Monochloramine (or equivalent) upon existing equipment and processes unique to the health care and residential environment.  This would include but not limited to:  Hemodialysis Unit water treatment equipment and processes; Sterilization, Processing and Supply (SPS) equipment and processes, including scopes; Dental Services water treatment and sampling/validation procedures; Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Services water treatment systems and analytical processing equipment; Research & Development Services water treatment systems and Veterinary Medicine Unit (VMU) research animals and sterilization/disinfection procedures.

The A/E shall prepare schematic single line diagrams of water systems and present the main areas of water distribution and processing and to identify any areas in which water is processed differently (i.e., hemodialysis and sterile processing). 

The A/E shall trace existing metal water lines and identify any potential dead legs in relation to exact locations of all underground utilities,  including hot water distribution systems.   

The design of Code compliant chemical storage facilities for the water treatment systems is part of this design contract.  The A/E shall evaluate Ammonia or Sodium Hypochlorite (Monochloramine treatment components) supplies, if used, and distribution logistics issues. The contractor should consider alternative locations for the treatment system regarding the safe storage of bulk chemicals which will require areas that are cool, dry, out of direct sunlight and away from heat and ignition sources, separated from incompatible materials, secured and separated from patients, high-risk areas, and work areas. The space must be fire-resistant with adequate ventilation.  Chemicals should be stored in the original, labelled, shipping containers and cylinders and secured by chain in an upright position to a wall, rack or other solid structure. Empty containers may contain hazardous residue.  Consideration should be given to the logistics of delivery, handling, and shipping; empty containers may need to be stored separately and kept closed. Design considerations will be given to include potential catastrophic release of highly hazardous materials.

This Feasibility Study should or may include within each of the three buildings, as appropriate:
o	Valves - main isolation valves, tempering, and mixing
o	Water outlets - showers, tubs, faucets, water closets, feeds to equipment (i.e.,                        food service, ice machines, water fountains, swimming pools)
o	Cross-connects - locations
o	Automatic water system drains
o	Heat exchangers -  types, capacities, output temperatures, controls description

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) and Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD).
The EPA/ORD/NRMRL/APPCD has a requirement for a continuous emission gas analyzer to be used in the Open Burn Test Facility (OBTF) at EPA's NRMRL laboratories in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The OBTF is used to conduct research on the emissions from open burning of various fuels, specifically biomass and waste fuels.  Pollutant emissions are sampled using various methods adopted from both open air and stack sampling methods.  Numerous instruments are employed in this study to capture the varied emission components. Gaseous emissions are measured in real-time for carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), total hydrocarbons (THCs), black carbon (BC), and fine particulate matter. Aerosols of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &#8804; 2.5 ?m (PM2.5) and varied forms of carbon (Black, Organic, Elemental) are measured in real-time for size distribution and concentration.  Gravimetric analysis is performed on the filter samples of aerosols and o rganic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) and black carbon (BC).
EPA requires continuous emission gas analyzers to measure total hydrocarbons (THC) and methane (CH4) (both or switchable), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The instruments will be incorporated into an existing but old (>15 years) continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) system to expand the research capabilities and improve the data quality of the OBTF research testing. 
The performance and technical requirements for the individual analyzers are based on the emissions measured from current and previous OBTF testing accomplished to date. Emissions from the OBTF burns are captured with in-facility open air samplers or in a stainless steel duct system. Dilution air, supplied to the OBTF via a forced draft fan and induced draft fan, maintains the interior OBTF oxygen concentration close to ambient, ensuring that open air burn conditions are simulated well.  
The OBTF emission sample is provided via a heated (120 ?C) 1/4" ID Teflon sampling line, filter and pump. The pump provides excess flow to support multiple instruments at a pressure of 5 psi. Excess flow is provided to ensure adequate sample supply and vented to atmosphere. The gas stream goes through a water knockout system to remove excess moisture. This sample flow then goes to a common manifold and is flow regulated (rotameters) to the existing CEMS at rates specified by the instrument manufacturer. This gas source is maintained at a 5 psi pressure by controlling an excess flow rate. Particulate filters are in-line with the sample gas stream prior to each instrument.
The oxygen concentration is near to ambient (~20.9%) at all times due to the flowrate of ambient dilution air involved.  The enclosed OBTF experiences about one complete air exchange every 60-90 seconds.
The following table shows the expected concentrations associated with typical test conditions. CEMs will be required to meet these concentrations.  Note, actual measured concentrations include values less than and greater than those presented.

The contractor will be required to assist NCA personnel in performing analysis with AEM, to include data collection and writing reports. Some travel will be required based off of the necessary performance of the tasks presented below. The Contractor and any sub-contractors will maintain a TOP SECRET//RESTRICTED DATA//CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS DATA clearance for access to weapon output data and other relevant information throughout the period of performance of the contract.</p>
<p>8. Request for Statement of Capability (SOC):</p>
<p>The SOC shall contain the following information: (1) Demonstrate knowledge of the Arsenal Exchange Model (AEM) to include detailed understanding of AEM input processes, mathematical algorithms, and internal coding, as well as PDCALC and JMEM processes and the way these are interfaced in AEM; (2) Demonstrate a detailed knowledge of and ability to modify the optimization, preemptive goal, and heuristic algorithms; (3) Demonstrate a knowledge of and ability to debug, modify and improve the AEM code; (4) Demonstrate expertise in the ability to build scenarios, run the code, and analyze the output using all input and output switches and variables; (5) demonstrate the ability to develop training courses that span the requirement from beginning user to advanced user.</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit, to the Contract Specialist listed below, an UNCLASSIFIED response that includes detailed information demonstrating their capabilities.

All contractor employees shall maintain, at a minimum, a Top Secret level clearance with Restricted Data and Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information (CNWDI) clearance for access to weapon output data and other relevant information throughout the period of performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Firms responding should include their DUNS number and cage code. Firms should include if they are a GSA Schedule holder and under what Schedule and Special Item Number(s) (SINs) they would propose potential work. The government anticipates using NAICS Code 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services; Size Standard: $25.5M.</p>

With the exception of the task orders awarded to meet the guaranteed minimum, the majority of individual orders will range between $150,000 and $750,000 in value.  There is the potential for orders in support of renovation projects to be awarded for up to $3M and orders below $150,000 if other contracting vehicles are not suitable.  There is an estimated acquisition value NTE $60M over a five (5) year period.  The contract will be awarded as a 5 year ordering period and the guaranteed minimum will only apply to the first year.  The guaranteed minimum will be obligated at time of the basic contract award.  The guaranteed minimum will be $25,000.  The estimated maximum dollar value of $60M will apply to the entire ordering period and there will be a maximum of $20M per each year of the ordering period with no minimum per each year of the ordering period. <br>  <br> The contract will establish terms and conditions upon which the Contractor will perform a wide variety of performance-based services and/or construction tasks as identified.

<CONTACT>Patrick J Murphy, Contracting Officer, Email murphypj@state.gov - William Smoot, Email smootwa@state.gov
<DESC><strong>1. INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>The Department of State is sponsoring an Industry Best Practice and Vendor Identification Conference to identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities, and experience to successfully deliver requisite services to sustain the Department's Aviation Fleet. The Department staff will present an Air Wing Command Briefing, present functional core and supporting contract requirements with a focus on small business set-asides, provide an open forum to ask questions, and a chance to have a one-on-one session with the Government. Industry should be prepared to discuss innovative solutions, available technology, and capabilities. This conference will be held on January 9 and 10, 2013 in Melbourne, Florida. The location will be provided as an amendment to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. <br />
<p><br />Following the overview presentations and the open discussion forum on January 9, 2013, the Government will host one-on-one sessions with interested companies, along with their anticipated subcontractor teams, provided prior coordination with the Government is established. The one-on-one sessions give companies a chance to ask specific questions regarding the program that they did not want to share during the presentation. These sessions will be limited to 30 minutes and may begin the afternoon of January 9, 2013 and between 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM on January 10, 2013 (January 11 will be an overflow day if needed). Session times will be assigned and companies will be notified of their time slot via email.</p>
<p>Information contained herein does not necessarily reflect all requirements to be found in any future solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this announcement. Responses to this announcement are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this announcement and attending the conference. All information received in response to this announcement that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly but will not be returned. Further industry comment will be requested during final definition of the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>2. SPECIAL OBJECTIVE<br /></strong>This conference will focus on the Department's intent to maximize the use of small businesses (especially HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, and Woman owned) in providing portions of the total requirement. The Department needs small businesses to inform the Government as to their capability to perform any portion of the required services. One of the conference objectives is to allow small businesses to present their capabilities in private meetings with the Government. The Government welcomes your capability statements and comments by email even if you cannot attend the conference.</p>
<p><strong>3. BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The Department of State (DoS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), Office of Aviation (INL/A) is initiating these market research activities associated with the continuing requirement for global aviation services. Chief among the myriad requirements to be contracted is the operation and maintenance of fixed wing and rotary aircraft at multiple sites in 8 or more countries in permissive and non-permissive environments and in direct support of US Government activities. Such sanctioned activities include, but are not limited to: personnel and cargo transport, aerial reconnaissance, medical and casualty evacuations, aerial herbicide application, aerial support to narcotics interdiction operations, aircraft ferrying, and emergent surge type operations. At some locations requirements include working with, and training host nation personnel in key disciplines, as defined by USG nationalization plans. <br /><br />While these services are currently under contract, the scope has grown and changed over the years and the Department desires industry input into modern industry practices and the most cost effective methods of providing requirements. This is industry's chance to help DoS redefine its requirements to take advantage of modern aviation practices. This is not a formal solicitation but is part of the Department's effort to better define its requirements for maximum contractor participation in future solicitations. The Government anticipates there may be a core operations contract with several ancillary functions competed separately during FY14 but this depends on industry input at this conference. <br /><br /><strong>4. REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong>The total dollar value of services could reach $10B over the life of the resulting contracts. The Department requests industry feedback into the most effective way to provide these services. An abbreviated list of requirements is presented below.<br />Operate and Maintain DoS Aircraft Worldwide. DoS currently has 412 aircraft in its inventory. 120 are operational globally for drug interdiction and transport of personnel. 292 aircraft are in flyable or non-flyable storage.</p>
<p>Current locations of performance are in Central Florida, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Guatemala, and Iraq. However, it is anticipated that performance may extend into other worldwide locations and the contractor(s) must be able to quickly extend operations to new locations on short notice, for limited duration. Recent examples of such include Sudan, Honduras, Malta, Libya, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Provide pilots and operational support for drug interdiction missions such as crop spraying, and the transport of personnel and cargo.</p>
<p>Provide Air Traffic Controllers where necessary</p>
<p>Provide certified maintenance personnel and qualified aviation safety personnel</p>
<p>Provide aerospace engineering services to include, but not limited to structural, electrical, avionics, aerospace, and metallurgy.</p>
<p>Provide reconnaissance missions when required, which may include sensor operation and maintenance</p>
<p>Provide medical and casualty evacuation (MEDEVAC/ CASEVAC) flights when required</p>
<p>Provide an Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE) program for program crews and designated host country</p>
<p>Create and maintain all required aircraft maintenance and flight records on systems compatible with Government systems.</p>
<p>Acquire and process weather and other risk information for operational planning.</p>
<p>Operate aircraft that have been nationalized to a host Government</p>
<p>Acquire, maintain, and make available technical publications as required</p>
<p>Provide wet and dry lease of aircraft on short notice for integration into DOS fleet operations.</p>
<p>Provide cost effective logistics for maintaining the DoS and foreign agency air fleets as needed worldwide. This includes parts acquisition, tracking and accountability, as well as global shipping capacity.</p>
<p>Provide inter and intra-theater transportation at all sites, as directed. <br />Provide life support services such as food, housing, laundry and MWR for personnel in permissive and non-permissive environments. <br />Provide defensive security for air fields and housing when required. This may be coordinated through USG security elements, Host Nation elements, or subcontracted, depending on the site and situation. <br />Implement and maintain a safety program across the spectrum of the Aviation Support Services Program that ensures that all organizational activities are performed safely, taking into consideration the austere and hostile environments present throughout INL/A's operating locations. Safety of personnel is paramount. <br />Provide tactical communication, computer, and internet services for operating and maintaining DoS and foreign agency air fleets.</p>
<p>Assist foreign government agencies, such as police departments, to operate/maintain aircraft through training and logistics services.</p>
<p>In summary, the Department of State requests your assistance in helping decide how our requirements in future solicitations for air operations and maintenance should be defined for maximum efficiency and small business participation. A conference is being organized for January 9 and 10, 2013 in Melbourne, Florida. We request your participation at the conference or your comments via email if you cannot attend.</p>
<p><strong>5. INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION<br /></strong>Pre-registration is REQUIRED. This is a no-fee event and seating is limited to two (2) individuals for each company as there is limited seating.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Social Security Administration (SSA) Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Systems (ODCS) Office of Electronic Services (OSES) Request for Information (RFI) DATE:  Oct. 06, 2014 SUBJECT:   Request for Information (RFI) for Software to facilitate and manage ongoing communications between the Social Security Administration and the public about Social Security Administration (SSA) Programs and Services. PURPOSE:   The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from Information Technology software providers about: ?	Products and services that will enhance SSA?s capabilities to engage the public over multi-channels of communications and provide case management functionality; ?	Infrastructure offering that can support the integration of third-party acquired Customer Engagement as well as in-house developed products. 
BACKGROUND: The Social Security Administration (SSA) has developed a robust authentication process that provides the public with electronic access to the mySocialSecurity web portal.  SSA plans to implement a Customer Engagement Center (CEC).  The goal of a CEC is to provide customer service and support on any and every channel. This CEC will be the integration point of all multi-communication channels and all of the applications and technologies that will serve to facilitate and manage all communications including self-service inquiry and communications between SSA?s Customer Service Representatives (CSR) and its mySocialSecurity customers.  QUALIFICATIONS:
SSA considers the criteria listed below to be important factors in the selection of software:
Protection of  personal identifiable information (PII).  PII must be protected when sending or receiving information from the public.  This pertains to both one-to-one communication with SSA agents and communication from SSA to a selected group of recipients.
Integration with SSA?s existing eServices authentication system.  Multi-channel communication with the public will be accessible through the existing mySocialSecurity portal.
Integration with third-party system.  The full solution may require acquisitions from multiple software providers.  All acquisitions must be interpretable on communication queried or developed CEC infrastructure. Scalability.  The number of registered mySocialSecurity users as of  9/01/14 is over 13 million and increasing rapidly.  Communication software must be able to handle a vast number of communications in a timely and efficient manner.
Integration with existing SSA systems.  A software solution must leverage information in existing SSA systems and data stores through automated programming interfaces (APIs), recognizing that data housed at SSA will be the information of record.
Section 508 compliant. Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandates that electronic and information technology developed, purchased, used, and maintained by the Federal government be accessible to people with disabilities. Software as a service offerings (SAAS).  Any SAAS cloud based solution must be either Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) certified or a private cloud implementation.
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION CATEGORIES: 
Responses to the RFI should include strategies to include one or more of the following functions as part of an integrated solution. 1.	The system should: a.	Encourage and facilitate the use of self-service communication channels to satisfy user inquiries including the Dynamic presentation of FAQs based on context (role, URL, topic).  b.	Provide i.	Secure one-way and two-way messaging, ii.	Attachments to messages, iii.	Secure Click to Chat, iv.	Secure Click to Talk, v.	Secure Video Messaging, and vi.	Secure Screen Sharing. c.	Provide or integrate user ?inbox? within the mySocialSecurity portal.  The user can initiate, receive, and respond to secure communications from SSA. d.	Utilize the SSA knowledge base and business process rules to provide an automated response to an inquiry. e.	Provide a unified view of all relevant mySocialSecurity customers? information from backend systems and provide guidance to agents to assist in servicing the customer. (This could be satisfied by integrating with our existing Customer Help and Information program, developed to support the agency?s 800 number teleservice centers, which contains decision support screens, knowledge bases and links to the relevant Policy Information). f.	Maintain a complete history of the mySocialSecurity customer?s communications with SSA across all available communication channels and make this history available to the Customer Support Representative (CSR). g.	Provide functionality to send targeted, marketing-type messaging based on mySocialSecurity customer preferences. h.	Provide functionality to send alerts to targeted classes of mySocialSecurity customers. i.	Support notifications via SMS text to mobile phones and email natively or through a third-party vendor. j.	Provide functionality to manage all aspects of engagement that SSA has with its mySocialSecurity customers across all offered communication channels.  The system must provide a holistic view of a customer?s interactions with SSA from the creation of a case based on the incoming inquiry to its completion, and a complete history of all the mySocialSecurity customer?s interactions with SSA.  2.	The system should provide case management functionality to manage a case from its inception through the collecting and processing of relevant information until the case?s resolution.  The case management functionality must present a holistic view that can include contact across multiple communication channels with multiple involved parties. 3.	The system should be installed on-premises; a FedRAMP certified government or  private cloud will also be considered. 4.	A rich set of APIs should be available to interface with SSA systems. 5.	All information generated in SSA processes, accessed from SSA systems, compiled as the knowledge base or collected by the system will be the property of SSA. 6.	The system should supply detailed management information and customer analytics. 7.	SSA personnel should have the capability to post informational messages to targeted groups of mySocialSecurity customers. These informational messages should be available for viewing by mySocialSecurity customers via their mySocialSecurity CEC inbox. The system should: a.	Integrate with SSA processes. For example, when SSA back-end system generate a notice, the system support the processing of a batch file email addresses and fill-in information to send a personalized email or text to the targeted user informing that a notice is available for viewing from their mySocialSecurity CEC inbox.  
b.	Send notifications to large targeted distribution lists based on the mySocialSecurity customers? enrollment for specific notification types, as well as on specific SSA information such as the mySocialSecurity customer?s servicing field office or status (i.e. collecting Social Security benefits).
c.	Construct messages using i.	Standard pre-defined templates, ii.	Ad-hoc notification compositions.
d.	Provide for the triggering of message distribution via i.	A distribution schedule, ii.	SSA personnel on-time initiation of a distribution, iii.	An SSA application initiation of a distribution. 8.	The system must provide Workload Management functionality that includes: a.	Development of subject matter specific workload queues used in routing customer engagement work items to SSA personnel with specific subject matter expertise.  SSA personnel accept work items from the specific work queues that they are assigned to work.
b.	Management of queuing functions including performance measures, creation of specific subject matter queues, creation of subject matter personnel pools, assignment of SSA personnel to  appropriate subject matter pools, and the assignment of specific pools to work specific queues.
9.	The entire system, including all user functionality used by the public and by SSA staff, must be fully Section 508 compliant.  Responses to this criterion must include: a.	Examples of 508 compliant solutions provided. b.	The steps that are required to deliver a fully compliant solution.  Please explain to what extent customization or custom code is required to deliver a 508 compliant solution.
c.	User functionality that cannot be made 508 compliant.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (i.e. HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541990 should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><br />Project Title: "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA)" <br />
<p><br />Project Description: The purpose of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) is to provide access to substance abuse and mental health data in order to increase the use of data for understanding and assessing substance abuse and mental health problems, as well as the impact of related treatment systems. SAMHDA is the sole point of distribution for the public-use files for the majority of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration's SAMHSA's Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics Quality's (CBHSQ) surveys, namely the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), the National Mental Health and Services Survey (N-MHSS) and the Treatment Episode Admissions and Discharge Data Sets (TEDS). <br /><br />In addition, SAMHDA houses other data from SAMHSA and other key substance use and mental health studies, such as the baseline National Comorbidity Survey (NCS-1). The data are currently distributed both as data files and through online table-generating software. Restricted NSDUH data is currently made available through an online restricted data analysis tool. Full access is available to approved researchers through the secure Data Portal for DAWN, NSDUH and other supplemental datasets collected under CIPSEA. All datasets are processed to ensure consistent display and documentation properties. All aspects of the website are maintained to mimic the look and feel of the SAMHSA website.</p>

<p>1. Host a web-based archive of datasets pertaining to substance use and mental health. Users of the archive should be able to directly download the data files along with documentation or conduct online analysis of the data and access the documentation with ease. The contractor will be required to maintain 24-hour/day access to current archive holdings by external users accessing the archive through the world wide web.<br />2. Maintain the current repository of over 120 studies.<br />3. Expand the archive to include new datasets from existing studies as well as new one-time studies in the fields of substance abuse and mental health. Each year, the contractor should expect between 10 and 20 new datasets for inclusion into the archive.<br />4. Process all incoming datasets such that they can be included in the archive for direct data file download, as well as for the online table generation.<br />5. Ensure that file download systems and an online data analysis system are user-friendly with appropriate documentation and tutorials available to users.<br />6. Provide a SAMHDA-wide search functionality that will identify words or terms in variable names, labels, question text and descriptions.<br />7. Conduct disclosure analyses on non public-use datasets to determine disclosure risks. Based on the results of the disclosure risk analysis, the contractor will be required to implement Statistical Disclosure Limitation (SDL) measures such that a public-use file can be created. The contractor will be required to have an independent Disclosure Review Board (DRB) with external members who will determine the nature of disclosure risk and appropriate remediation action. In addition, the contractor will need to possess a thorough understanding of laws and regulations related to data collection and dissemination in the areas of privacy and confidentiality. The contractor should also have expertise in the determination of suppressions and other disclosure limitation methods required in a restricted-use online data analysis system that uses inaccessible confidential restricted-use data to produce public-use estimates and analyses.<br />8. Make available an online data analysis system that can analyze data to produce estimates with their associated precision indicators. The data analysis system should be able to estimate means and frequencies with their associated standard errors using replicates or Taylor series-based variance estimation variables. The analysis system should also, at a minimum, be able to conduct linear and logistic regression analysis--correctly accounting for clustered designs in the variance estimation process. Users should be able to create recoded variables from existing variables and apply filters in order to analyze a subset of the populations. All output from the online data analysis system should be downloadable and easily copied into other formats. The system should also be able to produce both weighted and unweighted estimates.<br />9. Ensure that the online data analysis system applies precision- and disclosure-based suppressions and modifications to the generated estimates. Examples of suppressions and modifications include cell suppressions, suppression of unweighted sample sizes, and suppressions described in table B.2 (http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2012SummNatFindDetTables/NationalFindings/NSDUHresults2012.htm#AppB) in appendix B of the publication entitled, "Results from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings."<br />10. Provide user-friendly methods of downloading data and documentation, including datasets in multiple formats such as ASCII, R, SAS, SPSS and STATA.<br />11. Provide a method for users to login such that use and downloads can be tracked. Also provide a way for anonymous login and downloads.<br />12. Create all materials, including the archive website, to be 508 compliant.<br />13. Create dissemination and outreach materials, including conference booths, fliers, posters, brochures, postcards, presentation and workshop materials, etc. The contractor will be expected to represent the archive at relevant conferences through staffing of the exhibition booth, workshops and presentations. The contractor will be required to submit an annual outreach plan that outlines proposed activities and intended outcomes. All outreach activities will need to be coordinated with and through SAMHSA's Office of Communications.<br />14. Provide assistance within one business day to all requestors via mail, email and the telephone, and create a list of frequently asked questions and answers.<br />15. Be able to disseminate restricted-use data. Such a program includes provisions for accepting and evaluating applications, creating customized datasets, making these datasets available to users in a secure manner, conducting site visits to ensure security protocols being met, entering into agreements with the researcher's institution, and evaluating dissemination materials for potential disclosure risks.<br />16. Be able to set up and manage a virtual data enclave that provides confidential restricted-use data from a variety of sources. The data would be disseminated either directly or through software portals.<br />17. Ensure and maintain physical security of datasets so that the effect of a man-made or naturally occurring disaster (including intentional damage) is minimized. The contractor will be required to maintain electronic security so that unauthorized alteration of public data or documentation, as well as data that have been archived or not public-use, is minimized. The contractor will be required to provide a data security plan to the government.<br />18. Track detailed web usage statistics, costs per survey by contract year, help desk requests by survey and type of requests, website down time, file downloads, etc.<br />19. Provide monthly and annual reports, reports related to each disclosure analysis and on any other topic as required by government project officer.<br />20. Maintain a SAMHDA listserv to announce releases, special events and other key issues.<br />21. Attend annual or half-yearly meetings with the government project officer.<br />22.

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI)

This is a request for information (RFI) only.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered a Request for Proposal.  Do not submit a proposal.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy and PWS.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  
Background:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Loan Guaranty (LGY) Program provides home loan benefits to eligible Veterans obtaining mortgage loans through private lenders by guaranteeing a portion of the loan against default.  This allows Veterans to obtain mortgage loans at competitive rates with little or no down payment.  When a default occurs on these guaranteed loans, Veterans receive help in retaining their homes and minimizing their financial losses through primary servicing performed by their servicers and servicing by exception performed by VA.  The Veterans Affairs Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) was conceptualized to enable Loan Administration (LA) to improve services to Veterans, improve oversight capability over VA loan servicers, and to reduce the cost to the Government for defaulted loans.
VALERI supports the VA and LGY's mission in helping Veterans and their families retain their homes.  
VALERI is a web-enabled rules-based solution, designed to improve VA's oversight capability and to reduce the cost to the Government for the servicing and liquidation of VA-guaranteed loans.  It provides an interface between the VA and the mortgage servicing community, allowing mortgage servicers to report significant event updates to VA focusing on default, loss mitigation, foreclosure, and claim payments.  The current VALERI system provides both a web-interface and an integration component to allow automated loading of updates from VA mortgage servicers.  The web-interface allows VAs technicians to manage VA loans and evaluate servicer performance, allowing VA to intervene on the Veteran's behalf, when necessary.  Since November 2008, all servicers and all VA-guaranteed loans have been managed through the VALERI environment.  Currently, VALERI assists VA in managing over 2.02 million active VA loans (inactive loans are defined as 425 calendar days following the termination of a VA loan).  By Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, VA anticipates managing 2.7 million active and 10 million inactive loans.
The name "VALERI" is a VA trademark and will continue to be used for future system identification. 
The VA does not own the current version of the VALERI application. 
This RFI will provide the VA with market research to assist in the future of a potential loan servicing application. Request a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost be provided for each component of your response. The ROM shall include 5 out-years of sustainment costs.
This RFI has been broken into components; providing the opportunity to respond to the components of this RFI individually or in combination. For example, a vendor may determine to respond for the user interface (application) component and/or the hosting site component and/or all components. Request that an estimated schedule outlining the duration of tasks is provided for each component of your response. 
All variations of RFI responses are encouraged.  RFI responses shall be submitted via email to Contract Specialist Lana Farber at lana.farber@va.gov no later than 3PM EST on October 22, 2014.

<a href="mailto:Ronnette.Coffman@va.gov">Ronnette.Coffman@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 7, hereby provides notice of its intent to award a sole-source, firm fixed contract to the Sorin Group USA, Inc., Address: 14401 W. 65th Way, Arvada, CO 80004-3599. Funding will be less than $200,000.00, including four, 12 month options. The contract is expected to be awarded under FAR 6.302-1. A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared. The period of performance shall be a base year beginning 12 months from award, with four additional 12 month option years.
The contract will provide onsite preventative maintenance and corrective maintenance for the following Sorin Heart Lung Machines and all ancillary systems currently in use, on-site and validated at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston SC: :  EE: 180845, Model 48-50-00, SN# 48E02799, EE:180848, Model 48-50-00, SN# 48E2801, Model 24-90-30-Connect, S5 Complete, SN# 24S04051 and SN#24S04052. 
NAICS code: 811219 OTHER ELECTRONIC AND PRECISION EQUIPMENT REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE (SBA Size Standard $20.5M)
The services required meet Department of Veterans Affairs' legal obligation to continue the maintenance and repair services on these machines/equipment that are uniquely manufactured and serviced only by authorized Service Representatives of Sorin Group USA, Inc. The Department of Veterans Affairs believes that awarding the proposed contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays in meeting this legal obligation, as well as substantial additional costs to the government, and potential voiding of the warranty on existing equipment.
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement no later than October 14, 2014, 10 AM, EDT.

A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

All responsible sources may submit an offer; however, only services meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs requirements will be considered for award. The Department of Veterans Affairs will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice of intent. Only written responses will be considered. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this notice of intent, the Government shall determine if a solicitation will be issued. Any prospective contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award.

<DESC>The overarching goal of the SCOUT program is to develop chip-scale optical frequency comb sources that enable quantitative detection of multiple trace species in application-specific environments.  Sources are sought for a variety of techniques (e.g., absorption and Raman spectroscopies), geometries (e.g., point source detection and standoff), and form factors (e.g., handheld, remote deployment, and chip-level integration with other platforms).  Environments of interest may include ambient atmosphere, atmosphere polluted by smoke and aerosols, industrial process cleanrooms, solid and liquid surface residues, and human breath, with particular interest in both proximal (non-contact to 300 meters) and standoff (&gt; 300 meters) geometries.  Such environments are characterized by extensive spectroscopic "clutter" due to the presence of a multitude of absorbing species that may or may not be known a priori.  The unprecedented combination of high sensitivity and resolution with broad spectral coverage enabled by optical frequency combs, promises to mitigate the effect of spectral clutter, allowing trace-level chem/bio detection with novel signal processing algorithms.<br />See attached DARPA-SN-15-01 for more details.

<SUBJECT>--Limited Source Justification
<SOLNBR>EP10H000898
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:gilham.michael@epa.gov">Michael Gilham</a>
<DESC>This is a resubmission of a failed transmission to FBO from the week of 29 September 2014.
Limited Source Justification for Ceiling Increase to EPA Task Order EP10H000898 under GS-10F-0061N 
1)  Identification of the Agency, Contracting Activity, and Document being approved:
a. Agency/Procurement Office: U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/Office of Acquisition Management b. Organization:  Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) c. Modification 56 to EP-10-H-000898 d. Contractor: Industrial Economics, Inc. (IEc)
2)   Description of action being approved:  This Limited Source Justification is for an increase to the ceiling of the current performance period of the referenced Task Order in the amount of $400,000.  This ceiling increase is necessary because work under the prior option period of the order proceeded at an unusually slow rate as a result of the federal government sequestration and the shutdown of the government in October, 2013.  Funds for non-severable services under this order - that would have normally been utilized if not for such unusual circumstances - had to be moved into the current period, thereby creating a reduced capacity for new tasking and necessitating the need for the described increase. 
3)  Description of Supplies or Services Required: The purpose of the task order is to provide OECA with corporate finance, municipal finance, and accounting expertise to allow the agency to determine 1) the economic benefit of the non- compliance of environmental violators,  2) violators ability to pay for compliance, clean-ups, and civil penalties, 3) the value of supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), and 4) the value of compliance.  The Contractor provides support in updating the computer models used to make the aforementioned determinations, develops new models as appropriate, and educates enforcement staff on the models.  The Contractor also provides expert advice to enforcement personnel regarding financial issues that impact enforcement litigation and, when directed, provide support for enforcement negotiations, and provide expert witness testimony at hearings and trials.
4)   Authority and Supporting Rationale:  Authority for this action is provided by  FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C):  the work is a logical follow-on to the effort provided under the referenced Federal Supply Schedule order and it would not be in the interest of economy and efficiency to obtain the services from any other source.  The procurement of the current task order was conducted as a Federal Supply Schedule competitive acquisition using ordering procedures contained in FAR 8.4.  It is critical for the support of ongoing enforcement actions that the delay in the execution of earlier taskings, detailed in item #2, not prevent the agency from obtaining support for forthcoming needs.
5)  Determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d):  The ordering activity has determined that increasing the ceiling price represents a best value (as defined by FAR 2.101) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price and administrative costs).  The rates for work under this Task Order have already been deemed fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 8.404(d).

6)   A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:  Market research was not conducted for this ceiling increase action as it was not in the interest of economy or efficiency for the agency to consider other sources for the effort being performed under the current task order.  
7) Other facts supporting this justification: IEc has been successfully providing the discussed services to the EPA and is the only vendor that can provide any potential additional support in excess of the current order ceiling without causing unnecessary burden to the government.  
8)  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made: The increase in the total potential ceiling price is necessary to ensure that critical agency enforcement actions are not impeded.  Restriction of sources will be eliminated in the future by the competitive procurement of services, currently provided under the current Task Order, using FAR 8.4 procedures.  
9)  The ordering activity contracting officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief: This is to certify that the Limited Sources Justification has been reviewed and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete.
Michael Gilham <Electronic signature of physical document>            9/29/14 Contracting Officer Office of Acquisition Management
10) Technical or Requirements Personnel Certification:  This is to certify that the provided supporting information which is the responsibility of the undersigned program representative is accurate and complete. 	  Jackson Schad	 <Electronic signature of physical document>            9/29/14 Task Order COR, OECA

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SPECIAL NOTICE<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Potential Temporary Construction Camp Facilities at Clear AFS, Alaska<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</strong></p>
<p>1. Introduction:<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Alaska District is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain responses from members of the construction community interested in constructing and operating temporary construction camp facilities in the vicinity of Clear Air Force Station (AFS), Alaska. USACE intends to use the information provided for planning purposes and to help make strategic decisions regarding this potential procurement. USACE will not reimburse RFI respondents for any expenses associated with responding to this RFI, though USACE sincerely appreciates respondents' efforts and input. The USACE Alaska District may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) at some point in the future, however, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information provided.</p>
<p>2. Opportunity / Background:<br />The Government is seeking industry input regarding the potential to design/construct and operate temporary construction camp facilities in the vicinity of Clear AFS, Alaska, potentially during the period of 2016 through 2020. Clear AFS is located approximately 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska in the Tanana Valley and has a sub-arctic continental climate characterized by long cold winters and short mild summers. Temperature extremes can vary from a high of almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer to -60 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter.</p>
<p>This potential construction camp requirement is still in the advanced planning stage; initial indications are that the camp must support a temporary construction and technical workforce population of approximately 350-persons during 2018 through 2020. The potential plan is for the full implementation of the camp to take place in phases with the initial phase of the man camp being executed in 2016, if future funding is made available. The initial element of work would include the design of the full camp and the construction of requisite on-site potable water and septic utilities along with the kitchen/dining, laundry, and recreation modules. It would also include the construction of the initial sleeping modules to accommodate 150-PN. The remaining 200-sleeping modules to accommodate the full camp build-out would be delivered in phases as required to support the ramp-up off the vendor population. It is assumed that the temporary construction camp would be of modular design, and that all of the facilities and utilities would be designed to efficiently accommodate sub-arctic conditions with a planned life of five (5) years.&nbsp; The current planning strategy calls for the camp facilities to be located on cleared portion of Clear AFS within a designated partitioned area that is outside of the installation's security boundaries. The area has been cleared for multiple decades; however, considerations for arctic conditions, including challenging foundation soils should be considered.</p>
<p>The camp would require the development of on-site utilities including potable water, sewerage, commercial power, and communications. Potable water would be provided by the development of a temporary well and a looped pipe distribution system designed and constructed for sub-arctic conditions, including pre-heat. The water system would be sized to support fire hydrants delivering the water flow rates and quantity required by fire code. Sewerage collection and treatment would be through pipe collection into an on-site septic system designed for the specific soil and temperature regimes found at the site. All onsite utility development would be accomplished through permit with applicable regulators.</p>
<p>All relocatable facilities would be industry-standard structures as utilized in medium-sized temporary camps in sub-arctic environments and not custom-designed facilities tailored specifically for this program. They would require full Life/Safety Code Compliance including adequate egress and must be designed/manufactured to meet site conditions, including thermal requirements and all loading requirements for conditions at Clear AFS. When placed in the operational location, the relocatable facilities would be founded upon a foundation system compatible with soil bearing capacities and the structural design of the relocatable assemblies.&nbsp; <br /><br />The use of gang latrine/showers within sleeping facilities would be acceptable. In addition, the use of separate centralized latrine/shower facilities would be acceptable. The latrine and shower capabilities are to support worker hygiene requirements with adequate shower, sink, and toilet and urinal fixtures to support a maximum field population of 350-PN. Water would be required to be heated to applicable use requirements by "on-demand" type appliances. Facilities would need to have adequate ventilation and lighting and would be required to be heated.</p>
<p>For all man camp facilities, wired smoke/fire detectors would be required with a fire alarm system compatible with the system used at Clear AFS.</p>
<p>The Government is currently considering two (2) separate strategies for the fulfillment of this potential requirement:<br /><br />1) A Government construction contract(s) (potentially Design/Build) with a separate service contract to operate and maintain the camp and related utilities. Operation would include management, housekeeping, maintenance, and operation of food services and laundry services. Fully supported and operated by a service contact, all maintenance, utilities, and security would be the responsibility of the man-camp vendor contract personnel. Clear AFS personnel would provide emergency first response if required; however policing beyond the vendor provided security would be provided by Alaska State Troopers, or<br /><br />2) A turn-key vendor option, wherein the vendor provides and operates the man-camp under a performance-based scenario.</p>
<p>3. Statement of Limitations:<br />a. USACE represents that this RFI, submissions from respondents to this RFI, and any relationship between USACE and respondents arising from or connected or related to this RFI, are subject to the specific limitations and representations expressed below, as well as the terms contained elsewhere in this RFI. By responding to this RFI, respondents are deemed to accept and agree to this Statement of Limitations. By submitting a response to this RFI and without the need for any further documentation, the respondent acknowledges and accepts USACE's rights as set forth in the RFI, including this Statement of Limitations.<br />b. USACE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, without liability, to use any or all of the RFI responses in its planning efforts, and to develop and operate the temporary construction camp, in whole or in part, outside of this RFI process. USACE reserves the right to retain all the materials and information, and the ideas and suggestions therein, submitted in response to this RFI.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Terumo BCT, Inc. for  the Trima Blood Collection System. <br> The US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) requires the Trima Blood Collection System.  <br> The Coagulation and Blood Research Task Area at USAISR, Fort Sam Houston, TX has one Trima blood collection system and wants to procure two additional identical Trima blood collection systems. The Coagulation and Blood Research Task Area at USAISR is currently using a Trima sytem to collect and process whole blood units and blood components under H-10-023 protocol for research purposes. The two new Trima systems are needed to increase Coagulation and Blood Research Task Area's collection capacity to satisfy the demand created by additional funded studies. One Trima will go to Ft. Sam Houston and one will go to Lackland (AFB) Blood Donor Center.   These new Trimas will be used in parallel to the existing Trima system for a multicenter study. To minimize variabliitly and adhere to protocol SOP, USAISR feels that it is imperative that they use the same identical blood collection system. A non-Trima system would introduce unnecessary variables in the ongoing studies. <br> The proposed contractor for this requirement is Terumobct and is the only known source to distribute the GAMBRO Trima Automated Blood Collection System. The Trima Blood Collection System  is uniquely capable of meeting the requirements listed above. <br> This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 10 days, 17 October 2014, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable supplies and services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to hugo.m.robinson.civ@mail.mil. <br>

<DESC>This is the official solicitation for Tactical Shelters, Radomes and Towers (TSRT) Support.
<p>The Air Force plans to procure for support of the Tactical Shelters, Radomes and Towers engineering support program. This program provides worldwide support to shelter, radome, and tower systems that are embedded within weapons systems owned by nearly all organizations within the Air Force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our products are also used throughout DoD and by other government agencies such as FAA, NASA, and NOAA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TSRT engineering support program provides sustaining, development and maintenance engineering support important to the life cycle supportability and management, Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) compliance and accreditation of TSRT. We have identified a need to develop and update approved engineering baselines with information gathered from the field and acquired from depot sources. This requires audits of installed equipment and collection and evaluation of metrics with an objective of developing recommendations for identifying and resolving system discrepancies and improving processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Related requirements include reverse engineering to resolve baseline disconnects, updates to engineering documentation, updates to technical orders, validation/verification efforts with field demonstration, and recommendations concerning how to bring field equipment into line with the approved engineering baselines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The program is also developing advanced composites to replace existing conventional shelters, radomes and towers, seeking reduced energy consumption and system adaptation to energy saving management technologies and looking for important design, development, and implementation improvements for future shelter, radome, and tower systems, i.e., conventional and composite construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Advancements in shelter armoring are a consideration for future shelter systems. The inclusion of new technologies in our products drives the need to develop and/or modify technical data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The program does not support day-to-day field maintenance requirements, generally provided by organic resources. TSRT follow-on will be conducted as a competitive source selection, 100% set-aside for small business participation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Source selection decision will result in a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with pricing in each 12-month period for five years of ordering. The base year will be awarded at the outset, with an option for award of an additional one-year ordering period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A second option for the balance of three years' ordering will be established and priced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A 6-month period in support of the clause at FAR 52.217-8 will also be priced for the next competitive round, if needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This approach will accommodate review of performance in years 2 and 3 of the contract to determine if a follow-on competition would be appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Solicitation and all Amendments will be made available only on FedBizOpps (FBO) website at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">http://www.fbo.gov</a>.</p>
<p>All current and/or future information about this acquisition, i.e. solicitation amendments, and questions and answers, will be distributed through FBO. Therefore, interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this solicitation.</p>
<p>All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a DUNS number and be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to transact business with the Government. Failure to have a DUNS number and "active and complete" SAM account will result in an award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror.</p>
<p>Foreign contractors are not permitted to participate in this effort. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> Performance Work Statement For 196th IN BDE FY15 Civil Support Team (CST)Collective Training Events (CTEs)   <br>  <br> 1.0 Objective: The objective of the task is to assist and execute 36 hour, full scale, Chemical/Biological/Radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction Collective Training exercises in Hawaii. Exercises  will create an environment to facilitate the accurate assessment of the twelve National Guard Mission Essential Tasks outlined in the DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks dated May 09. These exercises will also involve the 93d (HI), 94th (GU), 103rd CST (AK), as well as other to be named mainland CSTs and the HI-CERFP.   <br>  <br> 2.0 Specific Tasks: The contractor will provide the necessary personnel, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment as indicated below to perform the tasks outlined:  <br>  <br> 2.1 Scenario Development-The CTEs will not only measure the training and readiness level of the team in accordance with DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks, but will also reinforce interoperability, communications, and RIP/TOA procedures and aid in the development of standard operating guidelines (SOGs). The scenarios must include at least one (1) Chemical, one (1) Biological, and one (1) Radiological hazard that will allow each team to challenge all of their capabilities and equipment.  The scenarios should be designed to aid in the identification of possible team shortcomings and weak areas; as well as to re-train those areas as necessary. It must also provide an environment ready for on-the-fly injects, as necessary, to ensure all of the DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks are completed to standard.  Should any weak areas be found, the scenario should provide for immediate re-training in those areas.  The scenario must provide the complexity and realism to represent an actual Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) event. Contractor provides realistic training aid, devices, and simulators that properly stimulate current CST detection and analytical equipment enabling the CST to make sophisticated assessments and decisions. Realism and technical exactitude are crucial for all training aid, devices, simulators, and locations. The full scenario should provide for one complete and continuous demanding day of training not to exceed 36 hours.   <br>  <br> 2.2 Scenario Staffing- The contractor will provide experienced and certified staff to create target sites that replicate chemical and biological laboratory production, radiological and explosives manufacturing labs, and act as role players in the scenario.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>
<p>(d) Any DoD determination under this clause is not subject to appeal under the Contract Disputes Act.</p>

The scenarios must include at least one (1) Chemical, one (1) Biological, and one (1) Radiological hazard that will allow each team to challenge all of their capabilities and equipment.

<strong>Original BAA Notice:<br /></strong>This solicitation is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), HSHQDC-14-R-B0005, as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be issued in this matter. This announcement does not request any white papers or proposals at this time. Solicitations (or calls) requesting white papers or proposals will be accomplished via amendments to BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005. BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005 is issued in support of Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&amp;T), Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), Cyber Security Division (CSD), targeted research and development (R&amp;D) projects. <br /><br />CSD BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005 will be open for five years from the date publicized on the Government's Point of Entry (GPE), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO). The strategy for a five-year BAA with the ability to make calls throughout the life of the BAA will allow for quick and efficient delivery of practical R&amp;D services to generate potential solutions for each technical topic area. <br /><br />Periodically during the five years, individual calls for white papers or proposals responding to the specified CSD program research and development program technical topic area will be placed (via amendment advertisement in FBO) against CSD BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005. Each call will (1) identify specific details regarding the call technical topic area, (2) identify submission instructions in addition to those outlined in the overarching 5-yr CSD BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005, and (3) contain a common cutoff date submissions. The call details will be such that interested and capable contractors can tailor a response and provide a submission in response to the call.<br /><br />CSD BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005 should be read in its entirety by any entity considering a submission in response to any call issued against this BAA as it provides the information/details needed for entities to participate in future calls issued against this BAA. CSD BAA HSHQDC-14-R-B0005 can be downloaded in its entirety from this FBO announcement.

An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.<br />(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).<br />(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties.

The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.<br />(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."<br />(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.<br />(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.<br />(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.<br />(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:<br />On execution of contract $ _______<br />(month) (day), (year) $ _______<br />(month) (day), (year) $ _______<br />(month) (day), (year) $ _______</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/ SOLICITATION <br />HSCG40-14-Q-19005<br />NORTHERN LIGHTS OEM PARTS
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".<br />"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes.

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p>(e)(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test. <br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes re-inspection or retest necessary.</p>
<p>(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</p>

Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute. <br />(i)(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time-</p>
<p>(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and <br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</p>

Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</p>
<p>(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</p>
<p>(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</p>
<p>(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l) (1) or (l) (2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A REVISED SYNOPSIS, AS OF 07 OCTOBER 2014:
<p>This request is issued on an unrestricted basis. This is not a solicitation or request for proposal; this synopsis is for the purpose of soliciting SF 330's from Architect-Engineer firms in order to select the most highly rated firms for the purpose of possible discussions. There is no specific design effort being solicited. This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and four option periods of one year each. The NAICS Code is 541330. The resultant solicitation and award will be accomplished in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in the procedures of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 36.6. A-E services are required for development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various/potential projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.</p>
<p>A. Type of Work: North Carolina Registered Professional A-E services with the required disciplines of architectural, structural, civil, environmental, electrical, fire protection, and mechanical. Field surveying, geotechnical, landscaping design and architectural rendering capabilities must be identified. Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm. A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. The selected A-E firm will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project that will result in a task order. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $4,900,000.00 with the maximum task order amount of $500,000.00. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $2,000.00 for the life of the contract. The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, plumbing, electrical, fire protection, site work, and mechanical requirements. Field surveying, geotechnical investigation, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required. Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required. The firm must also be able to provide on-site engineering to perform complete/partial designs, design reviews, cost estimates, etc. on an on-call basis for one (1) to five (5) days per week (not every week, just as needed based on workload), part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services. All drawings are to be D size (24" x 36") in paper and electronic attachment, DWG format and shall be 100% compatible with Computer Assisted Design Drawing Software (CADD). Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing layer usage, and scale information for drawings. CADD Drawings shall conform to SJAFB CADD standard which is based on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers CADD STD 4.0 dated July 2009. CADD drawing sets shall use the Drawing Sheet Set Manager, drawing templates, and layer standards as described in SJAFB CADD standards. Title blocks shall remain unaltered and title block data shall be updated utilizing the Sheet Set Manager. The selected firm must have the capability of providing final drawings formatted in AutoCAD 2012 or higher, drawings produced using AutoCAD LT versions are unacceptable. Each final drawing set shall be provided using the "E-Transmit" function of AutoCAD, and provided on CD-ROM formatted for the Windows operating system. On occasion, Building Information Modeling (BIM) may be requested or required (see http://www.wbdg.org/references/afbim.php). Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm or its sub-contractors. The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&amp;M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work. All offerors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to receiving a contract award. All offerors in response to a solicitation shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at https://www.sam.gov in conjunction with required registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.</p>

<br /><br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE.
<p>The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</p>
<p>Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</p>
<p>Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</p>
<p>This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</p>
<p>Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p>Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</p>
<p>Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</p>
<p>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</p>

<DESC>This preliminary announcement serves as a notice of proposed contract action for the Technical Order Management Follow-on acquisition for Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Nuclear Capabilities Logistics Division (AFNWC/NCL), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. <br /><br />The official solicitation number of record is: <strong>FA9401-15-R-8000<br /><br /></strong>A formal Request for Proposal will be issued on or about&nbsp;17 October 2014, on the Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fbo.gov . Once the solicitation is posted, it is the responsibility of interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. This notice allows for potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirement and increase the efficiency in their proposal preparation. <strong>This notice of intent does not in itself represent the issuing of a formal request for proposal and is not intended to be taken as such. No proposals will be accepted.<br /><br /></strong>The purpose of this effort will be to provide Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) tasks required to support the AFNWC/NCL mission of Technical Order (TO) Support and Logistics Management. This will require supporting aircraft nuclear weapon loading, warhead mate/de-mate, delivery, transport, storage (in-ground vaults), integrated security system (WS3) and a mobile maintenance platform for the United States Air Force (USAF), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and non-U.S. NATO nuclear-capable systems in technical editing, distribution and support of both classified and unclassified TOs in accordance with applicable Air Force Instructions using ADOBE Frame Maker and other associated publication/graphic software. The offeror will assist the government as the POC for nuclear Technical Order Distribution Offices (TODO) training initiatives and assist the AFNWC TO management team with other nuclear TO management efforts. The offeror will disseminate system policy and procedures. The offeror will track and assist with management of the TO change request process, assist with TO account management, packaging and distribution of classified and unclassified AF TOs and Joint Nuclear Weapons Publication System (JNWPS) publications IAW applicable instructions. They will be required to use current management system software to manage TO accounts and use the TO account management system when implemented. The offeror will convert any and all paper or digital TOs to usable electronic format (for example, PDF, S-1000D, HTML, SGML, XML, etc.) and perform related duties involving TOs and flight manual support. All Foreign Military Sales (FMS) support hours will be tracked separately for each case. The offeror will provide support for stockpile management, second destination transportation, weapon/component moves, tracking of automated reports and data input into various systems, and maintain those systems. Access to a classified DTRA database and classified information will be required at the Secret Level. All work must be integrated with government civilians within AFNWC/NCL and will only be done in AFNWC facilities at Kirtland AFB, NM, expect during temporary duty support. The offeror is responsible for training contractor employees in current publication software on offeror time. The offeror will support TDYs for conferences or other support activities in wither CONUS or OCONUS per government direction. All personnel must have, and be able to maintain a minimum of a Top Secret Security Clearance.<br /><br />This requirement will be solicited for full and open competition. The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), which is expected to result in a single contract with FFP and CPFF CLINs. The contract will have a Base Year of 12 months, with 4 Option Years, each lasting 12 months. The period of performance for this requirement is 16 March 2015 - 15 March 2020. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990, with a small business size standard of&nbsp;$15,000,000.00. <br /><br /><strong>Foreign participation is not permitted on this requirement. <br /></strong><br />Technology developed under the subject program may be subject to U.S. export-control laws and regulations. These laws restrict the transfer, by any means, of certain types of items, information and technology to unauthorized persons. The award of a government contract does not negate the contractor's responsibility to comply with export control requirements under the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration Regulations (Department of Commerce). Potential security risks/export violations may occur when contractors employ foreign nationals or outsource portions of the contract's statement of work. The transfer of sensitive or critical unclassified technology to a foreign national without an approved export license is a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act.<br /><br />All prospective contractors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for contract award. Registration may take several weeks to complete, so immediate attention to ensure eligibility is recommended. For registration, go to http://www.sam.gov and follow the instructions.<br />

<p>6. Notice Type: Sources Sought - Statement of Capabilities (SOC)</p>
<p>7. Description of the efforts needed are included in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS): AFNWC/PZID is seeking to determine if there are interested and qualified parties for a competitive procurement for maintenance, modification, support, and training for the Arsenal Exchange Model (AEM). AEM is a government-owned legacy computer program, written in Fortran 2, 4, 66, and 77 that models nuclear and conventional conflict. AEM has been continuously under development since 1964 and is used by AFNWC for force structure alternatives analysis. Please note that the government is not interested in an upgrade at this time.</p>

<DESC>Human Analyst Augmentation research encompasses science and technology development, experimentation and demonstration in the area of improving the perception, understanding and analysis of intelligence operators through the application of a cognitive systems engineering design cycle; ensuring technology solutions accommodate work as it is actually performed. This entails several rapid iterations of: in-depth knowledge elicitation from real-world operators, identifying barriers to work, rapid-prototyping to address those challenges, and evaluation with operators. Ultimately, this effort will develop an understanding of what it takes for an integrated human machine intelligence analysis team to navigate and understand vast quantities of intelligence data.

Qualification Requirements 52.209-1. The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review pending Source Approval Request (SAR). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified sources require acquisition of the part from the approved sources. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. Prequalification of alternate sources is required to maintain part quality and reliability. Currently, Boeing, Cage Code 81205, is the only known source for NSN 4820005089145. Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation. Interested persons/firms may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, proposal or quotation. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested sources may submit a capability statement, quotation or proposal that will be considered by the government. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. The solicitation will be available for download on the release date from www.fedbizops.gov. No telephone requests. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ) Maneuver Ammunition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC)-Automated Testing Systems Division (ATSD), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking sources for the replacement/upgrade of digital test instruments for the Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS).   <br>   This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought. In preparation for a possible future procurement, ACC-NJ is performing this Sources Sought to explore a breakout strategy for this requirement. ARDEC-ATSD is interested in exploring the market capability to support this effort and determine if a competitive environment exists. The Statement of Objectives identified under this Sources Sought is as follows:   <br>   STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:   <br>   The ARDEC-ATSD objectives are to replace/upgrade digital test instruments in the NGATS. The current stock of digital test instruments utilized by the NGATS have reached the end of their life cycle and have become obsolete. This effort shall be used to acquire, validate and deliver the next generation of digital instruments to be used in the NGATS.   <br>   Through analysis, the Government has determined that supporting and maintaining the current digital instrument has become cost prohibitive and it would make economical sense to upgrade/replace the cards at this time. Upgrading/replacing the cards will greatly reduce the cost of ownership as well as provide additional test capability.   <br>   DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW):   <br>   The Draft Statement of Work (SOW) will be made available through the Procuring Contracting Officer upon request. To obtain a copy of the SOW, interested sources shall submit a valid DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, a fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and an AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire. In addition, each company shall include the following information as a part of their request for SOW: company name, address, Cage Code, DUNS number, company size, business point of contact, and technical point of contact.    <br>   Interested parties shall submit a brief capability statement, no more than five (5) pages, demonstrating how they are capable of meeting this requirement.  Standard corporate brochures are not desired.  The capability statement should include the following:  company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contract, DUNS number, Cage Code and company size (please specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business), and technical description of ability to meet the requirement.      <br>   In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). This registration can be accomplished at the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Therefore, all interested and potential firms must be registered in SAM, and current firms must update their registrations regularly to reflect the most current company information and to maintain active status ensuring registration does not expire. Whether applying for assistance with awards, contracts, or other business opportunities, all entities are considered registrants. Registration in SAM in no way guarantees that a contract or assistance award will be issued. The following information is required to register in SAM: DUNS Number; Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Taxpayers Name; statistical information about your business; and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Information.    <br>   This Sources Sought is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be published. If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. The Army is not seeking, and will not accept, unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government is not responsible and will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary. Please identify any proprietary information submitted. Any of the information stated above is subject to change. Information provided will not be returned. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES/SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept questions via email ONLY. All submissions are requested to be made within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this publication, via electronic mail to the Point of Contact (POC) for this action: Ms. Vicki Bocchino, Contract Specialist, ACC-NJ-MA, email: victoria.r.bocchino.civ@mail.mil.

The barracks were originally built in the year 1961 and last renovated in 1988.  Cadets are currently housed in the existing barracks, which do not meet current Army standards.  They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration.  The barracks are sub-standard and do not provide sufficient square footage.  The barracks are also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities.  Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets.  The current barracks do not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population.  The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health, security, and safety of the Cadets.  There is no air conditioning in the barracks.  The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety, and security codes and requirements.    <br>

<p>A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The attached list of NSNs is the items for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>

In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price.

The building projects a professional and aesthetically pleasing appearance including an attractive lobby and entranceway. The surrounding property is professionally landscaped and well maintained. The building has excellent natural lighting, windows are energy efficient and the building is well insulated. The facade, downspouts, roof trim, and window casing are clean and in excellent condition. All building systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning, fire prevention, elevator, plumbing, electric) are new and energy efficient. The space offered provides for excellent physical security of the building.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GOOD (2)<br /></span><br />The space offered is located in a modern building and has undergone, or will undergo by occupancy, a first class restoration or adaptive reuse for office space with modern conveniences. The building exterior (including downspouts, roof, trim, and window casing) is clean and in good repair. The building has an attractive facade, energy efficient windows, adequate natural light, and an attractive lobby and entrance. The surrounding property is attractively maintained. Although the building systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning, fire prevention, elevator, plumbing, electric) are not new, all will be replaced or renovated with new material prior to occupancy. The space offered provides for good physical security of the building. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />FAIR (1)<br /></span><br />The space offered is not located in a new or modern office building, but is in a building which has undergone, or will undergo by occupancy, a restoration or adaptive reuse for office space which is basically cosmetic in nature. The building's exterior is in fair condition, the facade is acceptable, natural lighting is fair, and windows have been reconditioned so that they are energy efficient. Surrounding property is maintained in a fair condition including lobby and entrance. At least one or two of the building systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning, fire prevention, elevator, plumbing, electric) have undergone renovations in which equipment has been reconditioned and cosmetic changes have been made to the system's appearance. The space offered provides for fair physical security of the building. <br /><br /><strong>LAYOUT AND LOCATION IN BUILDING<br /></strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXCELLENT (3)<br /></span><br />The space offered has the potential for a very efficient layout of interior offices and furniture and would be consistent with the highest and best intended Government use. It is single floor, ground floor, contiguous, level, more square than rectangular in shape, and would lend itself to an efficient agency layout of either conventional or modular furniture. There is a minimum of columns, power poles, or structural obstacles that would impede efficient layout. The front entrance of the space is conducive to a reception area sufficient to handle the office's needs. The space is located on the ground floor.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GOOD (2)<br /></span><br />The space offered has the potential for an efficient layout of interior offices and furniture and would be consistent with the Government's intended use. The space offered is a single floor, contiguous, level, and more rectangular than square in shape (not more than twice as long as it is wide). The design could accommodate either conventional or modular furniture. There are a few columns, power poles, or obstacles that would minimally interfere with an ideal office layout. The front entrance could accommodate a reception area that could approximate the needs of the office. The space is located above ground floor and is serviced by multiple elevators.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAIR (1)<br /></span><br />The space offered has the potential for an adequate layout of interior offices and furniture that would accommodate the Government's intended use of the space. The space offered is single floor, or if multi-floored the major office operation is on one floor. The space is significantly more rectangular than square in shape (three times as long as it is wide) or odd shaped such as an L-shaped space. While the space could accommodate the office layout or, if applicable, a modular furniture design, the design would result in wasted space due to an excessive number of structural objects or the nature of the space which would impede an efficient office flow. The space is located above ground floor and is serviced by at least two elevators, one of which could be a freight elevator.<br /><br />The offerors with space located above ground floor that is serviced by one elevator will get no points for layout and location in building. <br /><br />Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease is required.

, Washington, DC 20009 US
<DESC>Pursuant to FAR12.207 (b)(1)(i)(A), a Time-and-Materials contract is needed because there are no predictive methods, which will assist the Government and contractor in determining the precise amount of time or level of effort that it will take to accomplish the outreach and education service tasks for this project. Accordingly, these unknowns represent substantial risks that could adversely impact a contractor financially should they enter into a firm fixed price agreement for marketing and advertising services, and subsequently, discover that the amount of effort exceeds the dollar amount contemplated under a fixed price agreement. In such a situation, there is no financial incentive to perform without compensation, making the Verification Division vulnerable to not accomplishing its mission.

<DESC>The project scope includes limited exterior renovations and more extensive interior renovations. At the exterior, repairs are needed for cracked brick columns at an enclosed entrance porch. This will probably require removing and reinstalling existing windows and doors around the columns to facilitate column repairs. Also, a small wood window, louvers and infill panels at the basement were not replaced with other windows and should be replaced now. Inside the building, the scope includes renovating the upper two floors to improve the layouts and finishes of the guestroom suites. There will be selective demolition of interior bearing and non-bearing walls. Mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems will each receive moderate to major replacements or repairs.
 Fire sprinklers and other fire safety systems will be installed. Interior finishes will be patched and replaced as required, throughout the building, as a result of work of other trades.

<AWARDEE>Chenega Decision Sciences, LLC, 14295 Park Meadow Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151 US
<DESC><strong>Work Description</strong><br /><br />The DOS IRM Enterprise Server Operations Center, IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC, (ESOC) provides the centralized domestic enterprise data center infrastructure to house critical applications and data for the DOS. There are currently multiple core data centers located in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Two of the Department's larger Tier III data centers provide colocation, co-managed, hosted, and managed data center services. One of the Tier III facilities is a government-owned facility; the other is currently hosted in a commercial facility. DOS is seeking to transition from the commercial facility into a government-owned campus at the Beltsville Information Management Center (BIMC), Beltsville, MD upon expiration of the commercial colocation contract in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.
<p>DOS is seeking to implement a "private cloud" model, implementing the first instance as a new container-based BIMC solution. This solution will break from the traditional, virtualized data center, and will form the foundation for a redesigned data center environment of the DOS to provide a true "private cloud" offering. A container-based private cloud in a box solution is defined as a standardized and self-contained data center unit that can be assembled at a contractor site and subsequently delivered to the customer's ultimate location, to enable the Department to consolidate servers into an efficient and flexible data center infrastructure. The modular data center is delivered as a turn-key deliverable, including components such as the modular (container-based) data center trailer/building, the IT equipment populated and operational in the container, the cloud software/platform solution loaded and configured into the IT equipment, and all necessary configuration, installation, start-up, site-preparation, and commissioning services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract for fixed-price supplies and services meeting technical and performance requirements.<br /><br />Place of contract performance shall be at the contractor's site and at the Government site at Beltsville, MD.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>The IDIQ contract has an effective period of 12 months ("base year", starting September 30, 2014) with four 12-month option years. Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause of the contract. The total contract ceiling of $40,000,000.00 was derived from the maximum estimated purchase quantities over the entire period of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>See attached sole source justification, as required by FAR  6.3.<br /></strong></p>

<DESC>The USAID funded Help Ethiopia Address the Low TB Performance (HEAL-TB) Project is a 5 year cooperative agreement being implemented since July 2011 by Management Sciences for Health (MSH) in partnership with different partners.
<p>The overriding purpose of this performance evaluation is to independently assess the overall performance of the project-in terms of achievements and challenges faced during implementation-and to identify actions aimed at improving management during the remaining life of the project. The findings are also necessary to inform the design and implementation of similar projects in line with the USAID/Ethiopia Country Development Cooperation Strategy. A Team Lead and a Logistical support from an independent organization are determined to be used to conduct the over all performance evaluation of the project.</p>

The basis for this proposed sole-source procurement is that Satisloh is the only ophthalmic eyeglass lens processing equipment manufacturer that has commercially available equipment with a unique set of features that satisfies the government's needs.  The VISN 20 Optical Fabrication Lab presently uses an alloy based blocking system for the processing of eyeglass lens blanks that is capable of processing up to 600 orders per 8-hour shift.  The government has defined its need to increase production output capacity to over 1,000 orders per shift, reduce production lead times without substantially increasing the manufacturing equipment footprint within the lab, eliminating the hazardous waste stream associated with alloy blocking, maintaining compatibility and seamless integration with presently installed manufacturing equipment without retooling, employ a fully automated system capable of operating with minimal user input between the blocking and de-blocking phases of operation, and adopt an alternative lens de-blocking technology that does not rely on kinetic shock to break the adhesive bond.  Furthermore, the lab has also identified an opportunity to install additional equipment for the application of anti-reflective (AR) coatings to eyeglass lenses, further reducing production lead times due to the new found ability to insource orders requiring the application of AR coatings.
Questions concerning this acquisition must be directed to Justin Blyth at the above contact information.

<DESC>LIMITED-SOURCES JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE PROGRAM<br />FAR 8.405-6(c)<br />Requisition Number: DJF-14-2100-PR-0009888 <br /><br />Date: 09/16/2014<br />Estimated Contract Dollar Value: $208,125.00 ($38,097.00 per year)
<p>The following justification and approval for the use of sources limited to fewer than those required in FAR 8.405-1, prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(c) FAR 8.405-2, and FAR 8.405-3 pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 251 per FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) - only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq, and 40 U.S.C. 501).</p>
<p>1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.<br />The U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, (Facilities Contracts Unit - FCU), proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for service maintenance and repairs of a Heidelberg Prinect, Suprasetter Plate Maker, Optiplex 790 2X on behalf of the FBI Printing and Graphics Unit.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with the Heidelberg USA, Inc., a GSA Schedule contractor, for a GSA schedule service agreement in combination with open market parts for the FBI's Heidelberg Prinect, Suprasetter Plate Maker, Optiplex 790 2X. It is the FBI's intent to issue a firm-fixed price contract for maintenance/repair service agreement for this Heidelberg equipment; utilizing GSA Schedule 70, "Equipment, Software, and Services" Special Item Number 132-12, and 132-34 for this non-restrictive procurement action. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 811310. The contract term will be for a base year with four one-year options.</p>
<p>3. A complete description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>The FBI Printing and Graphics Unit has in operation a Heidelberg Prinect Supersetter Plate Maker, Optiplex 790 2X. This equipment requires regular maintenance services and repairs that only a specialized factory trained Heidelberg technician can provide. The manufacturer's warranty for the equipment has expired and a service/maintenance agreement is needed to keep the equipment at peak operating condition. A company authorized technician with the required security clearance is needed to provide full-service maintenance on a schedule in accordance with the manufactures specifications and replace/repair all parts with the manufacture's original Heidelberg Prinect Supersetter Plate Maker, Optiplex 790 2X parts (no after-market parts) to help minimize loss production time. To replace all included parts, consumables, and supply items as often as is necessary.</p>
<p>4. The authority and supporting rationale (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i) and (b)(1)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.</p>
<p>FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i) (B) - only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p><br />The functionality of the printing press is very critical and to assure efficiency and quality performance is maintained on a regularly basis will require the qualifications and specialized capabilities that is uniquely provided by the manufacturer Heidelberg USA, Inc. Due to the brand specifications of the printing equipment, it is necessary for the FBI to have Heidelberg factory trained technicians perform the maintenance and repair services. Heidelberg certified technicians are the only technicians authorized to work on new Heidelberg printing press. Heidelberg USA, Inc. is a GSA schedule contractor with schedule maintenance service and parts as well as some open market parts.</p>
<p>5. A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d).</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine, after considering the level of effort and the mix of skills available for the tasks needed, that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>6. A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders, and the results of the research. A statement must be made that the supplies and services are available from the FSS.</p>
<p>Heidelberg USA, Inc. issued a letter certifying that Heidelberg is "the only factory authorized provider in the United States of new Heidelberg printing and post-press equipment and new Polar equipment. Heidelberg USA, Inc. is also the only factory authorized provider of parts and services for this equipment." A market research conducted by both the requiring office and the Contract Specialist at Facilities Contracts Unit (FCU) also revealed no third party technicians besides Heidelberg's own would have the specialized knowledge and technical capabilities to service Heidelberg equipment. Furthermore, Heidelberg USA, Inc. is a GSA schedule contractor with schedule price list for maintenance, parts, and training.</p>
<p><br />7. Any other facts supporting the limited source justification.<br /><br />FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i) (B) - only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p><br />8. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made.</p>
<p><br />The FBI will continue to do market research to identify potential sources for subsequent acquisition and maximize competition to the fullest extent possible.</p>

Allowing Cisco to continue to provide maintenance avoids a learning curve that a new vendor would endure.
