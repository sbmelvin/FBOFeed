The selected firm/contractor is expected to hire local engineers and support staff who can assess the needs, design, monitoring and evaluation of renovation.  In addition, the selected firm/contractor is encouraged to subcontract part of the work to local engineering/construction firms. The approach to renovation planning and implementation may be summarized in two phases: Phase one: Assessment and production of detailed renovation specifications, architectural drawings when necessary and bill of quantities.
