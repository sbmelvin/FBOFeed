However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a> on the issue date of 6/26/14.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Meggitt (No Hollywood) Inc. (79318).&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A").

The solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside, and will be awarded under a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Type Contract. The resultant contract will be for a base year and four (4) one-year term options. The base year minimum quantity is 2,325 PR, and the annual order limitation quantity (AOLQ) is 11,625 PR. Each of the four one-year option terms will have a minimum quantity of 2,325 PR and AOLQ of 11,625 PR. All materials used in the fabrication of these items are to be furnished by the successful offeror.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This procurement will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable method of source selection. The objectives of the acquisition are met through determining offers technically acceptable. An offer will be determined Technically Acceptable when it meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation and takes no exception to any terms or conditions of the solicitation. Award will be made based upon the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The following technical evaluation factors are anticipated:</p>
<p>1.  Proof of ISO 9001 Certification upon Proposal      Submission.</p>
<p><br />2.  Proof of NFPA 1977 Certification OR Proof of Application for National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1977 Certification.</p>
<p>3.  Terms and Conditions: The offeror must meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation and take no exception to any of the terms or conditions. <br /> Each offeror must complete a clause checklist verifying that all listed clauses are completed in full. Failure to complete all clauses listed in the checklist may determine an offeror technically unacceptable.<br /> <br />NFPA 1977 Certification is required prior to award.  If the item fails NFPA 1977 Certification or if proof of NFPA 1977 Certification cannot be produced in the timeframe designated by the Contracting Officer prior to award, the Government will reserve the right to award to the next lowest technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>Although Past Performance is not a technical evaluation factor, the Government reserves the right to review Past Performance when making a determination of responsibility. This may include the review of Past Performance data from other sources such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); as well as information pertaining to production capacity, technical capacity, procurement history, financial capability, laws and regulations, and integrity and ethics.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be FOB Destination, Inspection and Acceptance at Origin. Initial shipment of this item is required 120 days after date of award.  Subsequent delivery orders will have a production lead time of 90 days.  Pre-production First Article samples will be required within 30 days.  Destination: Tracey, CA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) during or after September 2014.  All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) in order to be eligible for award.  All responsible sources may submit offers which shall be considered if received timely.</p>
<p>-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------</p>
<p>Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means that in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate.  There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate).  VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2013. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.</p>
<p>DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems.  ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.</p>
<p>The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br /> 1.  IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br /> 2.  ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br /> 3.  VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p>There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can use the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to a hard drive.  If one person logs on from different computers they should use the Medium Token Assurance which is portable, similar to a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate.  Each user will need their own.  Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br /> ----------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance).<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx.<br />----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment") impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; mso-pagination: none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Multiple factors have indicated that the DBH disposal concept may be technically feasible and cost effective for safe disposal of some </span>smaller DOE-managed waste forms<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> in possibly many locations in the U.S. with favorable geological and hydrological characteristics. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC), created by the Secretary of Energy at the direction of the President, as part of its work, examined the work done on DBH disposal over the last decades in the United States and other countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The BRC recognized the possible role the DBH disposal concept could play in the safe and effective disposition of nuclear materials, and the BRC specifically recommended more research, development, and demonstration of the DBH disposal concept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Administration's <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste </em>specifically recommended developing a research and development plan for deep borehole disposal, consistent with BRC recommendations. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; mso-pagination: none"><span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">The DBH disposal concept is to drill a borehole (or array of boreholes) into crystalline basement rock to a depth below surface of about 5,000 m (greater than 3 miles).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this disposal concept, waste canisters would be emplaced in the lower 2,000 m of the borehole, with sealing of appropriate portions of the upper 3,000 m of the borehole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The borehole seal system might consist of alternating layers of compacted bentonite clay and concrete, and asphalt might also be used in the shallow portion of the borehole seal system. <span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Additional information can be found in "Reference Design and Operations for Deep Borehole Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Waste" SAND2011-6749, October 2011,</span><span style="COLOR: black"> </span><a href="http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2011/116749.pdf"><span style="COLOR: black">http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2011/116749.pdf</span></a><span><span style="COLOR: black">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The potential use of deep boreholes for waste disposal is similar to other examples of engineered geo-systems, such as geothermal energy production, in which science and engineering is used to appropriately modify the geosphere to achieve a societal goal. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span><span style="COLOR: black">Using science and engineering, the natural system would be modified to create an engineered geo-system that is safe, efficient, and cost-effective.</span></span></p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). <br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to JEOL USA Inc., 11 Dearborn Road, Peabody, MA, 01960-3862, to provide maintenance services to two JEM transmission electron microscopes located in the Electron Microscopy Core Facility in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) Laboratories.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Comprehensive maintenance for the following instruments and accessories: <br />o JEM-1400<br />&#61607; JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscope (Serial # EM 18470093)<br />&#61607; EM-11020 Common Specimen Holder<br />&#61607; EM-21010 Common Specimen Holder<br />&#61607; Seg Side Entry Goniometer for 1400,2100,1200F,2200FS,2500SE<br />&#61607; Non-refrigerated Water to Water Recirc WW2HN2SK9 (Serial # HB22056)<br />o JEM-1200EX<br />&#61607; JEM-1200EX Transmission Electron Microscope (Serial # 158056-169)<br />&#61607; SQH10 Quick Change Specimen Holder<br />&#61607; EM-SEG10 Side Entry Goniometer<br />&#61607; Heat Exchanger WW2HKN2R4SK8, W/50 Hal. Reservoir (Serial # HB22072)</p>
<p>&bull; The comprehensive maintenance shall include the following: <br />o Ensuring all instruments and accessories are kept in good, working condition with minimal downtime<br />o Two (2) preventive maintenance visits<br />o Unlimited emergency service as required<br />o Replacement and repair of all parts as required</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.<br /><br />The purview of our research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.<br />DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders.<br /><br />The NHLBI Electron Microscopy Core Facility provides technical services, training and support for NHLBI/DIR investigators in all research projects that require structural information in the molecular to subcellular range at a higher level of resolution than can be obtained by photomicroscopy. In the past 4 years the Core supported 80 projects for 39 principal investigators. Roughly 50% of the data generated with the support of the Core consisted of electron micrographs taken with the JEM-1200EX and JEM-1400 transmission electron microscopes belonging to the Core.<br />&nbsp;<br />Over the past reporting year there have been 14 NHLBI PIs, Staff Scientists, Postdoctoral Fellows and Postbaccalaureate IRTAs who have been trained on and/or used either of these electron microscopes, in addition to the 4 Core staff members and a summer student. All indications are that the 1200EX and 1400, which are used most work days, will continue to be heavily used through the next 5+ years. <br /><br />A maintenance agreement is required to ensure the electron microscopes remain in good working condition. Neither the Electron Microscopy Core Facility nor the NHLBI can afford to have the Core's instruments down for an extended period of time as critical research heavily relies on the use of these instruments.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />This acquisition is for the purpose of procuring a maintenance agreement for two JEM transmission electron microscopes located in the Electron Microscopy Core Facility in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Base: November 21, 2014 through November 20, 2015<br />Option Period 1: November 21, 2015 through November 20, 2016<br />Option Period 2: November 21, 2016 through November 20, 2017<br />Option Period 3: November 21, 2017 through November 20, 2018<br />Option Period 4: November 21, 2018 through November 20, 2019</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command has a requirement for the execution of work during the USS GEORGE H. W. BUSH (CVN 77) Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in late 2015. PIA efforts include manpower, support services, design integration, engineering and management support, and technical data required to prepare for and accomplish this work during the availability. The work to be accomplished will include repair or replacement of shipboard nuclear propulsion components or systems along with complex modernization of weapons systems.
<p>The requirement will be procured, without full and open competition, from the only qualified source capable of performing the PIA work for the USS GEORGE H. W. BUSH (CVN 77) nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Because of the unique certifications, capabilities, and expertise required to work on nuclear propulsion and other specialized systems (e.g. catapults, arresting gear, CIWS, etc.), the Government does not anticipate significant subcontracting opportunities for this requirement. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Huntington Ingalls Incorporated - Newport News Shipbuilding directly.

FBO is the single point of entry for the posting of synopses and solicitations to the Internet.</p>

<DESC>The Responder Technology Alliance Communication System (RTACS) project is a fast paced, rapid prototype development of a suite of wearable electronics designed as an integrated interoperable communcations to support first responder needs. The goal of this project is to incorporate existing commercially available communication features and venues into a innovative interoperable assembly that utilizes cellular, land-mobile-radio, WiFi, and Satellite communications to transmit and receive audio, video, and text information from the command center (911 Dispatch, Incident Command Centers, Emergency Response Centers, Hospitals, etc.) to the first responders.<br /><br /><strong>This Request for Proposal is for the design, development, testing and delivery of 4 complete assemblies that satisfies the requirements identified herein and within the Statement of Work. <br /></strong><br />The Responder Technology Alliance Communications System (RTACS) will be designed to support emergency response inter- and intra-agency voice-activated, hands-free communications that includes fire, police, emergency medical service (EMS), and other emergency response organizations and agencies. The RTACS will also be designed to support communication among multiple on-scene agencies and various incident command and control personnel by automatically providing position information, responder state of health, and other biometric and environmental sensor information to increase situational awareness. The RTACS will be designed to integrate the availability of multiple communications venues including land and mobile radio (LMR), cellular, satellite, and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and selecting the most reliable communications medium to transmit information to dispatch, peers, broadcast, multicast, or incident command. The RTACS also provides responder (Blue Force, cooperative localization) tracking and positioning information via the Global Positioning System (GPS) and/or other positioning systems.
<p>This first-generation system may be part of a larger integrated system using paired responder-mobile system or other spoke-and-hub-style systems (mesh network). <br />RTACS shall include the following:<br />&bull; voice-activated, hands free 2-way voice, video, and data operation with multiple parties<br />&bull; Blue Force Tracking ability of each responder<br />&bull; a seamless transition to existing federal land based mobile systems <br />&bull; active noise-canceling capability to eliminate any unnecessary background noise<br />&bull; smart technology to interrogate available cellular, LMR, Wi-Fi, and satellite systems, and transmit and receive information based on infrastructure availability. The wireless system shall be capable of transitioning between Wi-Fi hotspots, cellular and RF towers, or satellite communications.<br />&bull; an innovative approach that facilitates interoperable self-assembly networks between responders or paired responder-mobile platforms to facilitate communication<br />&bull; the ability to integrate responder multiple sensors including but not limited to video, heart rate, and external/internal temperatures<br />&bull; recording and storage capability up to one shift not to exceed 12 hours</p>

<DESC>Engineering Services Requirement for support of In-Service Engineering Agent for Marine Air Traffic Control and Landing System (MATCALS) / Air Traffic Controls and Landing Systems (ATCALS), and Mobile Fixed /Tactical Fixed Systems.
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific) in support of Airspace and Joint Systems Division, Code 411, is tasked by and provides direct support to several DoD and non-DoD Agencies in support of Marine Air Traffic Control and Landing System (MATCALS) / Air Traffic Controls and Landing Systems (ATCALS), and Mobile Fixed /Tactical Fixed Systems.   Code 411 has identified a requirement to provide total life cycle engineering and technical support to DoD, non-DoD U.S. Agencies, and foreign military governments for Air Traffic Control (ATC) command and control, ranges and navigation equipment for shore facilities, ships, and aircraft worldwide.  The supported systems include radar displays, imagery systems, transmitters/receivers, data processing/fusion, communication, and ancillary navigational/radar equipment. These systems are used in support of air, land, and sea operations.  SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific intends to issue a solicitation (RFP N66001-14-R-0024) for a single award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract.  CLIN structure will include cost reimbursement type CLINS for Material as well as cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) CLINs for the engineering services.  The contract is expected to have a base period of three (3) years, followed by two (2) additional option years, totaling five (5) years for continued mission support.  The Material CLIN will be non-fee bearing.  The annual estimated level of effort for the base period is 202,680 hours with an optional 67,560 for option year one (1) and 67,560 hours for option year two (2). The NAICS Code is 541330.  This requirement will be fulfilled via open competition as a 100% small business set-aside.  Market Research in accordance with FAR 10.002(b)(2)(i) yielded a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns. The SSCPAC Small Business Office (SBO) reviewed the market research results and concurred with the total small business set-aside. The estimated release date of the solicitation is 06 January 2015.
THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO THE SOLICITATION. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
Electronic copies of the solicitation, when released, will be available for download via the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command E-Commerce Web Page at https://e-commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil/ under SSC PACIFIC - Open Solicitations.

To comply with the OI&T IRM Strategic Plan, an overall VA OI&T ACSI score of 76 by fiscal year 2015 and a VA facility level minimum ACSI score of 72 by fiscal year 2017 is desired.  To accomplish this objective, the VA OI&T CRM office focuses on six program areas that include:  1) Customer Communications; 2) Business Intelligence Data Sciences; 3) Customer Service Improvement; 4) Customer Forums; 5) Service Level Management; and 6) Customer Satisfaction Metrics.  The Statutory Authority for this effort falls under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." This is a total set-aside for service-disabled Veteran-owned small business.  The primary North American Industry Classification System is 541611 with a size standard of $15 million.  

This notification shall close on November 7, 2014.  This is a notification of intent, not a request for proposals.  Attached to this pre-solicitation announcement is a DRAFT SOLICITATION.  This draft solicitation foreshadows the formal Solicitation announcement which will be posted in the near future and will request formal proposal submission.  Offerors are encouraged to submit comments and questions as they relate to this DRAFT solicitation.  Questions regarding this action shall be directed to Brandon Caltabilota, Contract Specialist at Brandon.Caltabilota@va.gov and Charles Ross, Contracting Officer, at Charles.Ross@va.gov with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-15-R-0025.

<CONTACT>Andrea Phillips, 703-704-0821

<a href="mailto:andrea.s.phillips10.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Washington</a>
<DESC>a.  Purpose.  The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Belvoir Division is seeking information regarding the recapitalization of the MEP-PU-810A/B Prime Power Unit.  The Project Manager, Expeditionary Energy & Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) may have a future requirement to modernize the MEP-PU-810A/B Prime Power Unit.  The U.S. Army's current large mobile electric power generating asset, the MEP-PU-810A/B, Deployable Power Generation and Distribution System (DPGDS) Prime Power Unit (PPU), is nearing the end of its economic useful lifecycle (EUL).  The DPGDS PPU contains two diesel engine driven, three phase, 50/60 Hertz (Hz), prime power generators with an integrated primary power distribution center designed to deliver 4160 Volts Alternating Current (VAC), at either 60 Hz 840 kilowatt (kW) or 50 Hz 700kW total power.  Figure 1 below shows the two models of the DPGDS PPU currently in use.  In the inventory today, dispersed throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) are 174 'A' Models and 66 'B' Models. <br> Figure 1:  MEP-PU-810A/B <br>   <br> Many of the spare parts are becoming obsolete or are no longer manufactured.  This mission capability remains critical for Prime Power DoD operations in support of National Security and Federal Relief Organizations during decisive action.  The need exists for improved, electric power generation capability for power requirements at or above 800kW.  The Government envisions that six (6) PPUs (three each of the A and B Models) would be provided as First Article Test (FAT) units to a vendor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) at contract award.  The vendor would make the approved modifications to the PPU's and after Government testing and acceptance, the test units would be returned to the vendor for any additional modifications required from the test results. The six recapitalized PPUs will then be delivered to the Government.  Recapitalization will be in updated configuration, different Model Numbers would be assigned (A Models will be returned as C Models; B Models returned as D Models).   <br>  <br> The Government is interested in improving its understanding of industry capabilities, identifying potential qualified sources and a cost per unit Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) on recapitalization of the current Prime Power Units.   <br>  <br> b.  Requirement(s).  The Government anticipates the following requirements: <br>  <br> 1.  Upgrade engines from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier I to Tier II* while maintaining capability of producing 800kW (min), 50/60 Hz, 4160/3800 volt 3-phase,  .8 power factor (pf), 4-wire power. <br> *Note: Tier IV is preferred if possible; primary fuel for the system is JP-8.  <br>  <br> 2.  The system must maintain the ability to operate at -25 F to 125 F, up to 4,000 feet without de-rating the system.  The Government anticipates a need for a winterization kit for starting at temperatures down to -65 F (see b.17).  <br>  <br> 3.  Upgrade 4160V SR4B Alternator insulation for austere conditions; utilizing the EnduraSeal process (includes 5-year warranty). <br>  <br> 4.  Upgrade the DPGDS Controls.  The current system is outdated including the Sixnet Remote Terminal Unit (RTU).  System must be able to parallel at least 16 units (minimum). <br>  <br> 5.  Upgrade Direct Current (DC) Electrical system to include battery chargers; currently, batteries are located outside on the fuel tank and shall be moved inside the unit housing.  <br>  <br> 6.  Upgrade tires to support the weight of A model: Both models shall be air transportable on C-141, C-5 and C-17 aircraft. <br>  <br> 7.

<p>7.	The chosen manufacturer must be willing to set a high priority for delivering bulk materials to the non-profit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the federal government customer(s).<br />8.	All products must be manufactured and lab tested, certified and customer tested to be effective according to their purpose, have current Material Safety Data sheets if necessary, and meet certifications with corresponding documentation designated by customers.<br />9.	A willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support while enabling the non-profit agency to meet the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to convert material, fill containers, label, assemble and package the products thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.<br />10.	Commitment to working independently with the AbilityOne to market products to the Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. It is preferred that the chosen manufacturer has a dedicated team for Federal Government sales and marketing.<br />11.	Willingness to work with the non-profit agency, NIB, and the Committee to ensure that the price to the end-users is a fair and reasonable price.<br />12.

If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the January - February 2015 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively. The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

<p>Additional information is available at: http://www.riley.army.mil.</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>If sufficient interest is identified and this requirement proceeds in a competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c) JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS. Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx. DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br />a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<DESC>Nursing Home Performance Work Statement (PWS)

The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Oklahoma City Healthcare System in Oklahoma City, OK is seeking a contractor capable of providing Nursing Home Services locally. Contractor must have a facility within a 15 mile radius of the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center at 921 NE 13th Street in Oklahoma City, OK 73104.

This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines. Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov.

A.	Overview 

1. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) - Basic Ordering Agreements. This is a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for the time period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.  A binding contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agrees to place a patient in the Community Nursing Home (CNH) and the CNH agrees to accept the patient. Upon acceptance by the Contractor of beneficiaries of VA, all clauses and terms and conditions of this BOA shall apply and become a part of the resultant contract during such time as a VA patient remains in that CNH at the expense of VA. 

2. Ordering (Authorization) Process.  VA acknowledges that, depending on the availability of resources at specific BOA holder facilities at specific times, acceptance of a referral may be commercially impracticable for the BOA holder.  In that event, the BOA holder may decline to accept an authorization.  If the BOA holder proposes another contractor facility, VA reserves the right to reject that facility and seek the services from another BOA holder.  If the BOA holder has determined space is available and has accepted the Veteran, an authorization will be issued. 

3. Orders. VA personnel designated in writing will issue written authorizations for Veterans to the BOA holder. Location primarily will be selected based on the Veteran's needs and proximity to the Veteran's home.

4.  A BOA shall be changed only by modifying the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under it.  Modifying a basic ordering agreement shall not retroactively affect orders previously issued under it. See FAR 16.703(c)(2).

5. Services Rendered at VA Per Diem Rates.  Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the CNH, if and when requested by the VA Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the Contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the services specified on the MEDICARE PRICING Table in the Schedule of Items of this BOA.  VA rates are generally based on CMS RUGs rates.  See Section D.1 (Contract Documents, Exhibits or Attachments) for RUGs Descriptions. VA is only obligated to pay for patients that are placed in accordance with this BOA. 


B.	Requirements
	
1.	Location. Nursing Home must be located within 15 miles of the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center at 921 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.

2.  General. Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA's CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2, "VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Primary care/provider (medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and/or physician assistant) visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans' transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA will include the cost of nursing care, room and board, meals, primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted (see Schedule of Items in this BOA for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

The Department of Veterans Affairs' (DVA) Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO) Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) on behalf of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with the FAR 15.201(e) to determine the availability and technical capabilities of qualified sources to provide Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps and Catheters. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. The Product Service Code is 6515, Medical and Surgical Instruments.

This notice is for planning purpose only and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive contract. It is emphasized that this is a notice solely for planning and informational purposes.

The SAC in conjunction with VHA is seeking qualified sources to provide Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps and Catheters on an agency wide basis. The Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps and Catheters have been identified as items for national purchase. The purpose is to obtain uniform and quality products at lower-than-current contract prices.

The Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps is a mechanical aid to the circulatory function of the heart.  The devices act to provide internal counter-pulsation, by a pump connected to a balloon device inserted into the descending aorta, to provide temporary assistance to the heart in the management of left ventricular failure.  The Intra-Aortic Balloon Catheter is designed with an inflatable tipped balloon that holds the catheter in place.  The catheter is inserted, most commonly into the femoral artery, and threaded upward so that the distal tip of the catheter is in the thoracic part of the aorta just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The proximal end of the catheter is connected to a balloon pump console that forces helium into and out of the balloon, inflating and deflating the balloon.

<CONTACT>Aliya Baioralova, Acquisition Specialist, Phone 0077272507612, Email abaioralova@usaid.gov
<DESC>This is &#1072; Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (&#1077;).
<p>USAID/Kyrgyz Republic is soliciting comments on the attached concept paper, related to supporting effective and inclusive service delivery through the Kyrgyz Republic's implementation of the Law on Local Self Government.  In addition to general comments on this concept, USAID/Kyrgyz Republic also invites responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>&bull;	Considering the number and diversity of local self-government units in the Kyrgyz Republic, what methodologies have been successful in identifying municipal units and services with the most potential for improvement?<br />&bull;	What lessons have been learned from similar efforts in countries at a similar stage of deconcentration, delegation, and devolution of service delivery?<br />&bull;	In countries where new devolution legislation was enacted without a deliberate plan or dedicated resources to implement the transition, what have been the characteristics of successful interventions to advance devolved local services?<br />&bull;	In countries where new devolution legislation was enacted without a deliberate plan or dedicated resources to implement the transition, what have been the characteristics of unsuccessful interventions to advance devolved local services?<br />&bull;	How can the Kyrgyz Republic's culture, norms, and evolving governance structure be incorporated throughout the design and implementation of a transition to devolved services?<br />&bull;	Current development literature suggests that the traditional approaches to the transfer of resources and knowledge may not be sufficient to create sustainable increases in local government competency and capacity.  How can USAID's Localization approach (see attached Concept Paper) be incorporated in a transition support activity to address that concern?</p>
<p>Please ensure that comments are clear, concise, and specifically address any or all of the above questions, while taking into consideration the information and approach presented in the attached Concept Paper.</p>
<p>Issuance of this RFI does not constitute &#1072; Request for Proposals.  Responses to this request for comments are not binding on the U. S. Government and do not obligate USAID to issue a Solicitation (RFP), nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of comments.</p>
<p>This request for comments will be open from the date of release through November 17, 2014, 09:00 am Almaty time.  Comments should be submitted electronically only to: AlmatyAASolicitations@usaid.gov.</p>
<p>Concept Paper<br />Transition to Local Self Government in the Kyrgyz Republic</p>
<p>Background<br />The Kyrgyz Republic is located in the heart of Central Asia.  This small, landlocked, former Soviet country features a nascent democracy, with a vibrant and increasingly influential civil society.  Continued U.S. Government development assistance will help the country consolidate its encouraging progress toward accountable, inclusive governance, and reap significant development outcomes such as increased economic opportunities and increased resilience.</p>
<p>While improvements in democracy are vital for the future of the Kyrgyz Republic, USAID/Kyrgyz Republic believes that the success of this democratically elected government is fundamentally dependent on its ability to improve the lives of its citizens.  This requires improvements in essential services that bring concrete, successful, sustainable outcomes.</p>
<p>On paper, the Kyrgyz Republic has advanced decentralization further than any other Central Asian country, with political power, representation, and fiscal authorities devolved down to local self-government units.  Unfortunately, decentralization in the Kyrgyz Republic remains only half-finished, which undermines long-term attempts to improve governance in the country.  The current devolution program fails to delineate how Local Self Governments are to transition from their current service provision model to one enabled by the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government (appended below).</p>
<p>Kyrgyz Local Self Governments are diverse, as are their recently devolved services:<br />&bull;	There are 453 Ayil Okhmotus (AOs) and 25 cities that are outside the national government structure<br />&bull;	The population of the AOs is from 3,000 to 30,000 with a wide range of capacity, competency, economic vitality, and economic resources; the ten largest cities have populations from 30,000 to 800,000 people<br />&bull;	The 23 areas of devolved services range from libraries, parks, and youth activities to public transportation, water, sewer, trash collection, and economic development</p>
<p>Purpose<br />USAID/Kyrgyz Republic seeks to assist Local Self Governments (LSGs) in their transition to devolved areas of responsibility by improving the administration and delivery of services, demonstrating the efficacy of USAID's Localization approach, and establishing an ongoing locally sustainable LSG support capability.</p>
<p>Transition assistance goals:<br />&bull;	Increase the fiscal discipline, allocative efficiency, and operational efficiency of  Kyrgyz Local Self Governments<br />&bull;	Identify devolved services that have the potential to demonstrate immediate, effective, and sustainable improved service delivery<br />&bull;	Incentivize LSGs by fostering community responsiveness and accountability <br />&bull;	Demonstrate the efficacy of collaboration between the Kyrgyz Government and Local Self Governments to improve service delivery; produce a replicable, locally sustainable methodology to advance devolution<br />&bull;	Identify systems, procedures, staffing, and training needs for individual local entities to increase their productivity and capacity</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />USAID's Localization approach for effective development:<br />&bull;	Engaging local systems to promote sustainability<br />&bull;	Embracing process and iteration rather than a perspective of toolkits and frameworks<br />&bull;	Recognizing the potential efficacy of having capacity development goals that may be less than ideal<br />&bull;	Developing modest and incremental approaches tailored to individual communities and their government<br />&bull;	Envisioning new approaches that are iterative, facilitative, and that demonstrate practical approaches in everyday circumstances</p>
<p>Illustrative Activities <br />Given the number and diversity of Kyrgyz Local Self Governments (LSGs), the assess methodologies that have been successful in identifying municipal units and services with the most potential for improvement from similar efforts in countries at a similar stage of deconcentration, delegation, and devolution.</p>
<p>Incorporating USAID's Localization approach, design and implement interventions with LSGs identified as having the most potential for improvement.  The activity will take into account the culture, norms, and evolving governance structure of each LSG.</p>
<p>Develop methodologies to design and implement interventions tailored to an individual LSG's unique circumstances.  In addition to basic government activities such as budgeting, revenue generation, and expenditure control, interventions may include areas as varied as community planning, public works operations, and economic growth initiatives.</p>
<p>As Kyrgyz and international donor resources are limited identify, coordinate, and collaborate with complementary Kyrgyz government and Kyrgyz organizations transition efforts, as well as with international donor activities to avoid duplication and maximize support.</p>
<p>Establish a locally sustainable LSG support capability to increase the likelihood of future LSG transition and capacity building initiatives.</p>
<p>Outcomes and Results<br />The outcomes of the activities will be:<br />&bull;	Ongoing, iterative, customized support to LSGs with the potential for improving services<br />&bull;	A replicable methodology for the analysis, selection, and support of local governments with the potential for improving service delivery<br />&bull;	An increase in locally sustainable competency and capacity in the furtherance of improved local government service delivery in the Kyrgyz Republic</p>
<p>The results of the activities will be:<br />&bull;	Better administered, more transparent, financially improved, Kyrgyz Local Self Governments<br />&bull;	Sustainable, responsive, and efficient improvements in the delivery of devolved services<br />&bull;	Increased responsiveness and accountability to LSG's communities<br />&bull;	Increased accountability to the Kyrgyz Government<br />&bull;	Increased community trust in their LSG and, consequently, increased legitimacy of LSG nationwide</p>
<p>Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government</p>
<p>The 2010 Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government (amended 2012, 2014) enumerates 23 "issues of local significance" devolved to the 453 Ayil Okhmotus (AOs) and 25 cities that are outside the national government structure:<br />1.	Ensuring the economic development of the respective territory<br />2.	Managing municipal property<br />3.	Forming, confirming and implementation of the local budget<br />4.	Providing drinking water to the population<br />5.	Ensuring the work of communal sewage systems and sewage treatment facilities<br />6.	Ensuring the functioning of municipal roads<br />7.	Organizing electrical lighting of communal places<br />8.	Maintaining cemeteries and funeral services <br />9.	Landscaping and public green spaces <br />10.	Maintaining parks, sport and leisure places<br />11.	Organization of collection, removal and recycling of waste<br />12.	Ensuring the functioning of municipal transport and regulation of public transport work within the respective territory<br />13.	Protection of cultural and historic heritage (sites of significance)<br />14.	Ensuring and organizing the work of local libraries<br />15.	Establishing the rules of land use and enforcement of the rules and regulations of city planning and architecture<br />16.	Deciding on the placing of advertisements in accordance with law<br />17.	Assistance in maintaining public order<br />18.	Creating conditions for developing public arts and culture<br />19.	Creating conditions for leisure activities<br />20.	Organizing activities  with children and youth<br />21.	Ensuring conditions for developing physical culture and sport<br />22.	Assistance in prevention and mitigating impact of emergency situations<br />23.	Exercise  authority in the sphere of subsoil use, within the jurisdiction of local government</p>

<DESC>The Technology Applications Contracting Office (TAKO) intends to issue an amendment to an existing Justification and Approval that will provide engineering support for New Build aircraft. The amendment will cover the engineering services for additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) efforts in support of Special Operations Aircraft. The proposed amendment revisions shall reflect the updated needs in the current ESS period of performance (POP) to support the advanced development of the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) Active Parallel Actuator Subsystem (APAS) and initiation of the Army common airframe in support of the planned Block II ECP integration. The APAS ECP will change the existing flight control pallets in Special Operations Aircraft to enable the next evolution of flight control technology, leveraging previous work with the DAFCS. The Army Common Block II integration leverages the engineering completed for New Build airframe and integrates further structural enhancements to converge on a common airframe for the conventional and SOF platforms. The proposed acquisition is still planned as a sole source acquisition with The Boeing Company, Boeing Defense and Space Group, Stewart Avenue and Route 291, P.O. Box 16858, Philadelphia, PA 19142-0858. The period of performance shall be solicited as a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for supplies which the Government does not own specifications and drawings to permit full and open competition. The Boeing Company is the sole manufacturer of the H-47 family of aircraft. The contract is releasable to U.S firms only. Requests from U.S. firms must be submitted in writing to the above address and must include business size. All responsible U.S. sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. The associate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 336411; the business size is 1000 employees. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.1. This notice of intent is not a request for a competitive proposal; however, the Government will consider all proposals received by the specified due date IAW FAR 5.203 (a). A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit research proposals for Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) requirements for the CBDP Ebola BAA for the FY2015-2016 program.</p>
<p>DTRA, with industry and government partners, has been working aggressively for the past decade to understand and counter Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). DTRA's program is currently supporting the accelerated development of a therapeutic through preclinical Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling activities as well as the clinical evaluation for one EBOV vaccine. The program co-developed the rapid field deployable diagnostic systems currently in use in West Africa. The program has also been adapting and improving upon North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) approved and high performance computing methods of modeling EBOV to perform analysis of the current EBOV outbreak. Recognizing that industry may have solutions applicable to the current EBOV outbreak in West Africa, this BAA has been released to ensure that all potential near-term solutions are considered.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) currently reports an ongoing outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa. The West African countries currently affected include Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, with past cases occurring in Nigeria and Senegal. There are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medical countermeasures for EBOV, the causative strain of the ongoing EVD epidemic in West Africa. Although diagnostic capabilities are available and are being utilized in West Africa, limitations with these current capabilities must be addressed. Similarly, improved modeling data, methods, and/or tools are required to better understand and predict the course of the current outbreak.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this BAA is to support development of near-term solutions such as therapeutic and vaccine candidates; diagnostic capabilities; modeling capabilities; and data gaps. For Medical Countermeasures (MCMs), only late stage development products for EBOV that can be completed and implemented in the near-term; defined as in time to assist with the current EBOV outbreak will be considered under this solicitation.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: windowtext;">The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).&nbsp; This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-77.&nbsp; This requirement is being solicited as a Total Small Business Set-aside.&nbsp; The NAICS Code is 336611, Ship Building and Repairing with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.&nbsp; The solicitation number is HSCG40-14-Q-P30091.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Informal Forum with the Ombudsman</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: blue;">FAR 33.103(d) (2)</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: blue;">FAR 33.103(e)</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Election of Forum. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</span></strong></p>

THIS NOTICES REPLACES NOTICE FA7037. ALL POSTINGS FOR FA7037 WILL BE UNDER THIS NOTICE! PLEASE NOTE: THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS CLOSED. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis, for market research purposes only, and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) is seeking possible sources to provide services to support the AFISRA Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) requirements, as outlined in attachment 1, DRAFT PWS (under NAICS 541512). Comments on this NAICS and suggestions for alternatives must include supporting rationale. This acquisition will also require contractor personnel have a final Top Secret Security clearance and be DCID 6/4 eligible with a current SSBI. The period of performance will be for a one-year base, with 4 one-year options. Possible task are outlined in the attached 4 attachments. Attachment 4 is the ID/IQ PWS and attachments 1 through 3 are the requirements for the current contracts. These tasks are samples of what type of work could possibly be put on task order, after ID/IQ contract is awarded. While this PWS identifies the general service area, the suite of resulting contracts (i.e. task orders) is intended to satisfy the full range of DCGS related requirements within this area of services. With the pace of technology change, it is difficult to anticipate how the Government's requirements and individual programs will evolve over the life of these contracts. The specific scope of each effort will be based on the specific tasks to be set forth in individual task orders (TOs), but may include tasks as outlined in attachments 1 through 3. This requirement will have a small business element. Understand that the Government will be looking for relevant experience of similar size and scope. When preparing responses to Sources Sought be sure to include any teaming or subcontracting possibilities. There will be a Small Business Industry Day established for this requirement, tentatively scheduled for the week of 27-31 Aug 12. The industry day date and location will be released on/about 1 Aug 12. Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as stated above, not to exceed 5 pages. The statement of capability shall include: I. Contractor Name a. Address b. Point of Contact (POC) c. POC phone number(s) and e-mail addresses d. Cage code e. Anticipated teaming arrangements (delineate between work accomplished by prime and work accomplished by teaming partners, clearly show full capability) f. GSA contract, if applicable and number II. Description of Relevant Contract Experience (Government and Commercial) a. Contract number (all contract types are applicable) b. Description of the requirement c. POC for the requiring activity d. POC address, e-mail phone number(s), fax number and the company's web page, if applicable Contractors capable of providing these services should submit a Statement of Capability, not to exceed 5 pages, containing the above reference information via e-mail to felita.thomas@langley.af.mil the Procurement Analyst/Contracting Specialist. No phone calls please. Please note that no additional information will be provided via telephone. Questions should be submitted to the above e-mail address and a response to all questions will be posted. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. Proprietary information or trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All Government reviewing responses, will have signed non-disclosure agreements and understand their responsibility for proper use and protecting from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information as described in 41 USC 423. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. Responses shall be received not later than 13 Aug 12, 0800 Eastern Standard Time. Please note, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, BUT A MARKET SURVEY TO LOCATE POTENTIAL SOURCES.<br /><br /><br />

<DESC>Amendment 01 (10.24.14):&nbsp; The solicitation number for this requirement has changed from SPE1C1-14-R-0105 to <strong>SPE1C1-15-R-0006</strong>.&nbsp; The RFP was posted to DIBBS on 10/23/2014.<br /><br />The POC for this requirement is now <strong>Rafael Nazario Vidal</strong>.&nbsp; Contact information is as follows:<br /><br />rafael.nazario.vidal@dla.mil<br />215-737-8613<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />The proposed RFP is for the Protective Chaps (NSN: 8415-00-286-7507 (s), PGC: 04007) to be made in accordance with Department of Agriculture, Forest Service specification 6170-4G. The solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside, and will be awarded under a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Type Contract. The resultant contract will be for a base year and four (4) one-year term options. The base year minimum quantity is 2,325 PR, and the annual order limitation quantity (AOLQ) is 11,625 PR. Each of the four one-year option terms will have a minimum quantity of 2,325 PR and AOLQ of 11,625 PR. All materials used in the fabrication of these items are to be furnished by the successful offeror.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This procurement will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable method of source selection. The objectives of the acquisition are met through determining offers technically acceptable. An offer will be determined Technically Acceptable when it meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation and takes no exception to any terms or conditions of the solicitation. Award will be made based upon the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The following technical evaluation factors are anticipated:</p>
<p>1. Proof of ISO 9001 Certification upon Proposal Submission.</p>
<p><br />2. Proof of NFPA 1977 Certification OR Proof of Application for National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1977 Certification.</p>
<p>3. Terms and Conditions: The offeror must meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation and take no exception to any of the terms or conditions. <br />Each offeror must complete a clause checklist verifying that all listed clauses are completed in full. Failure to complete all clauses listed in the checklist may determine an offeror technically unacceptable.<br /><br />NFPA 1977 Certification is required prior to award. If the item fails NFPA 1977 Certification or if proof of NFPA 1977 Certification cannot be produced in the timeframe designated by the Contracting Officer prior to award, the Government will reserve the right to award to the next lowest technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>Although Past Performance is not a technical evaluation factor, the Government reserves the right to review Past Performance when making a determination of responsibility. This may include the review of Past Performance data from other sources such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); as well as information pertaining to production capacity, technical capacity, procurement history, financial capability, laws and regulations, and integrity and ethics.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be FOB Destination, Inspection and Acceptance at Origin. Initial shipment of this item is required 120 days after date of award. Subsequent delivery orders will have a production lead time of 90 days. Pre-production First Article samples will be required within 30 days. Destination: Tracey, CA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) during or after September 2014. All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) in order to be eligible for award. All responsible sources may submit offers which shall be considered if received timely.</p>
<p>-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------</p>
<p>Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means that in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2013. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.</p>
<p>DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.</p>
<p>The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p>There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can use the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to a hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should use the Medium Token Assurance which is portable, similar to a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own. Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance).<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx.<br />----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment") impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>
