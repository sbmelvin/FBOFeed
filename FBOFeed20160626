<DESC>On February 4, 2014, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the formation of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) for Forensic Science. The OSAC is a collaborative body of approximately 580 forensic science practitioners and other experts who represent all levels of the government, academia and industry.
<p>NIST established the OSAC to strengthen the nation's use of forensic science by supporting the development and promulgation of forensic science consensus documentary standards and guidelines. The ultimate objective of the OSAC is to create a sustainable organizational infrastructure that produces consensus documentary standards and guidelines to improve quality and consistency of work in the forensic science community. <br /><br />NIST requires Contractor(s) to perform services for the Organization of Scientific Area Committee and plans to award one or more indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. The following general tasks are anticipated with specific requirements being identified in task orders:</p>
<p>Administrative <br />The Contractor shall produce templates, documents, and graphics, manage online application processes, manage membership rosters for OSAC, and manage activities required to develop and promote standards.</p>
<p>On-line and Web Based <br />The Contractor shall manage and maintain the website which is intended to serve as the future OSAC website. This shall include the transfer of existing content, legacy documents and work products, manage membership lists, produce and utilize graphics, artwork and templates, provide web design, development and editing, produce and utilize content, manage software licenses for OSAC operating units, maintain registries of standards and guidelines, and maintain catalogs of existing forensic standards and guidelines. Websites must be compliant with Section 508 and both Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) and IPv4.</p>
<p>Outreach and Communication <br />The Contractor shall complete outreach and communication tasks with the forensic community including developing and writing presentations and publications, creation and production of scientific posters, outreach materials, and writing of news releases.</p>
<p>Meeting Planning <br />The Contractor shall provide meeting planning and all logistical support to plan, manage and facilitate NIST sponsored full OSAC meetings. At least two meetings are planned per year. Each meeting is expected to have a total of 540 participants plus 50 international participants. Additional meetings include NIST FSSB meetings and various outreach meetings. It is anticipated that these meetings will include at least 15 participants for the FSSB meetings and up to 75 participants for each outreach meeting.&nbsp; Meeting planning shall include planning and on-site support, audiovisual support, site selection, creation and distribution of meeting materials, and other relevant logistical support for each meeting.</p>
<p>Standards Copyrighting<br />The Contractor shall maintain copyrights for standards developed by the OSAC until required to transfer to the entity designated by NIST. The Contractor shall be responsible for all tasks associated with completion of the transfer of copyrights. The Contractor shall not maintain future rights, royalties or other control of copyrights following the transfer of those copyrights to the designated entity.</p>
<p>Travel Reimbursement and the Ability to Access and Maintain PII, and NIST Data<br />The Government has a requirement for the Contractor to provide travel reimbursement and to access and manage personally identifiable information (PII) and NIST data that will be transmitted and stored electronically and/or in hard copy for some task orders. Consequently, the Contractor must, ultimately, be required to meet low level and moderate level FedRAMP requirements. It is noted that these requirements will flow down to subcontractor that will have access to NIST data and/or PII as a part of their required responsibilities.&nbsp; The Contractor shall, through use of their own resources and at their sole expense, engage a FedRAMP accredited third-party assessment organization (3PAO) to perform an assessment of all components and controls within the system boundary* to meet moderate level FedRAMP requirements (unless this has already occurred). NIST will review the 3PAO assessment results which may result in a need for additional information and clarifications that may be discussed via e-mail, phone, or in person.&nbsp; * The system boundary must include all contractors and sub-contractors that transmit, store, access or can access to PII and NIST data. NIST must approve system boundaries.</p>
<p>NIST will only use the Contractor services to store, process, or transmit data categorized with a FIPS 199 moderate impact level for confidentiality and integrity (e.g., proprietary and PII) after NIST agrees that the 3PAO assessment results identify an acceptable level of risk and that NIST issues a low level and moderate level Authority to Operate (ATO).</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $15.0 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Parts 12 and 15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. Award of multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-16-RP-0025.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately seven days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

Please direct any questions concerning this contract to Ms. Kiya Plummer-Dantzler at kiya.plummerdantzler@navy.mil.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.
