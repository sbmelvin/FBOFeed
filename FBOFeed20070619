<DESC>Notification of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has put forth a major initiative to promote a more value-driven health care (VDHC) system.  This VDHC initiative is based on four cornerstones ? (1) health information technology, (2) measurement and publication of health care prices, (3) measurement and publication of health care quality, and (4) creation of positive incentives for participation in a VDHC system.  In addition, in compliance with the August 22nd, 2006 Executive Order: Promoting Quality and Efficient Health Care in Federal Government Administered or Sponsored Health Care Programs, federal agencies are making available information on provider payments and quality.  Private health plans have begun to make available to plan subscribers information on provider quality and cost.  Given the variation that may exist across these initiatives, it is important to have a good structure for examining and evaluating their implementation and overall effectiveness.  This project will focus on the following research questions--1) what are measures of the effectiveness of health care quality initiatives, 2) what are the appropriate success indicators, and 3) what data requirements are needed to monitor and assess the effectiveness of quality initiatives?  Specific tasks include:  Initial Project Meeting; Project Work Plan; Assessment of Implementation Requirements; Assessment of Monitoring Requirements; Final Report and Presentation.  These tasks will be accomplished by utilizing information from previous and current research on health markets (and health care transparency in particular) and relying on key industry contacts and subject matter experts that have been used in prior and current analyses on health care market transformation.  This requirement shall be completed within 6 months.  This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, The Center for Studying Health System Change, Inc., under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  No solicitation document is available at this time.  Any firm that believes it may have similar capabilities is encouraged to submit their capability statement addressing each of the items/areas cited above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Small Businesses are encouraged to review this notice. E-MAIL CAPABILITY STATEMENT TO: Marc.Long@psc.hhs.gov.  
A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any requests for solicitation packages will be considered nonresponsive.   For further information, contact Marc Long at DHHS/PSC/SAS/DAM, Parklawn Building, Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-7086.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is planning to issue a sole-source purchase order to provide Inter-Tel AXXESS hardware to upgrade the existing Telephone system to a Version 10 system in support of the OST/Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).  The sole-source purchase order will be made to large business vendor Inter-Tel, Inc., 4310 E. Cotton Center Bldg., Suite 100, Phoenix, AZ  85040. The product is the Inter-Tel Axxess Digital Telephone System.  It features multiple trunk interfaces, digital telephone sets, and capability to accommodate TRADOC.  In addition, warranty requirements or restrictions necessitate that no item manufactured by another company be installed on these units.  The Inter-Tel items required are compatible with the items already operational in OST.  The system currently supporting OST/TRADOC is an Inter-Tel system Version 6.005.  The latest and recommended upgrade is Version 10.x. Inter-Tel is the only supplier of this equipment.  To change vendors would require changing out the entire system at TRADOC would almost double the annual cost of this purchase.  The current system has reached its capacity and is in critical need of an upgrade.  Compatibility with existing equipment in use by the Office of Secure Transportation must be maintained. The NAICS code associated with this procurement is 334210, size standard of 1000. Contract award dollar amount is NTE $86,824.44. The sole source procurement is expected to be awarded on or about June 25, 2007. This sole-source award is for the following: The product is the Inter-Tel Axxess Digital Telephone System.  It features multiple trunk interfaces, digital telephone sets, and capability to accommodate TRADOC.  These items possess special features not provided by comparable manufacturers.  Additionally, the items are compatible with the current system and systems already operational in OST such as the Transportation Emergency Control Center (TECC) and Alternate Transportation Emergency Control Center (ATECC).  No other systems are compatible with the Inter-Tel system. Accordingly, DOE intends to conduct this sole source procurement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and no other sources will be considered. A public solicitation will not be available. This notice satisfies the requirement of FAR Part 5 for publicizing contract opportunities. Firms wishing to challenge the sole-source decision must submit a letter of interest, referencing No. DE-AD52-07NA28196, to DOE demonstrating the firms ability to provide the equivalent items as described above. Firms shall also indicate whether or not they are a small business, small business women-owned, small disadvantaged business, or and 8(a) small business concern. Interested parties must provide rationale, including pricing, why they should be considered. All feedback received will be taken into consideration, however the agency reserves the right to not utilize the comments or any other information provided.  Any questions or comments pertaining to this action shall be e-mailed to Janet Anaya, Contract Specialist @ janaya@doeal.gov, no later than COB June 22, 2007. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFL) in Lakewood, CO is a part of the Office of Federal Lands Highway (FLH) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation.  The FLH provides planning, design, and construction engineering services for more than 90,000 miles of roads on lands administered by Federal Land Managing Agencies such as the National Park Service, Forest Service, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The CFL is seeking proposals for obtaining highway vehicle operating speed data for calibration and application of the Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM).  The IHSDM is a tool used by FLH to evaluate the safety and operational effects of highway designs.  The IHSDM?s Design Consistency Manual (DCM) is used to evaluate operating speed consistency on FLH two-lane rural highway design projects.  A limitation of the DCM for FLH is that the model was calibrated using data from State maintained highways with 55 mph speed limits.  In comparison, many Federal Lands Highways are designed for lower speeds.  In order to expand the range of applicability of the DCM to lower speeds for FLH application, it is necessary to collect additional data on lower speed roadways and to calibrate the speed prediction model for a wider range of conditions.  The methodology for collecting this data is more fully explained in the SOW which will be included with the RFP.   

Proposals shall address the offeror?s demonstrated understanding of the statement of work, technical approach to perform the work, technical capability to complete contract requirements satisfactorily, and past performance on similar projects.  This is a best value negotiated type procurement and evaluation factors for award will be  fully stated in the RFP which is available as noted below.

Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the website when considering submitting White Papers.  BACKGROUND: Oil Spill Response Research sponsored by the MMS through the TA&R Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements.  MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  As oil and gas industry activities continue to expand into greater water depths on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and into the ice-infested Beaufort and Chukchi Sea's of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability as well as alternative countermeasures, including chemical dispersants, in situ burning and viscous oil pumping.  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from fiscal year (FY) 2008 funds. The MMS anticipates that a total of $500,000 to $800,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSRR topics in FY 2008 with projects being identified through this announcement. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require up to one man-year effort and cost up to $250,000.  Projects spanning multiple years will also be considered.  Prospective offeror's shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  NOTICE: The MMS may share the White Paper submissions with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do NOT want the White Papers shared outside the MMS.  The MMS anticipates awards resulting from this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price basis.  OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2008 OSRR activities include ONLY research related to the following:  (1) Mechanical Technologies to Facilitate and Improve Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Under Arctic Conditions.  The MMS seeks White Papers for new or innovative mechanical technologies that will facilitate and improve the containment, recovery and processing of spilled oil in cold water and/or broken ice conditions.  This could include performance testing and evaluation full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain, recover and process oil in a range of conditions that include cold water and/or broken ice conditions.  One of the most problematic conditions occur when the ocean begins to freeze in the Fall.  Proposals should focus on the environmental and oceanographic conditions typically found in the Alaskan Beaufort and Chukchi Sea, where oil exploration and development activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey and/or through a series of field tests, including experimental oil spills conducted in the Arctic environment.  American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  (2)  Virtual Command Post.  The MMS is seeking White Papers to develop software programs that provide access to critical information during an emergency response to an oil spill.  The software program should include the ability to remotely access all information developed during a response, including all Incident Command System forms. The software program should be intuitive and easy to use.  (3)  Oil Spill Response Training Software.  The MMS is seeking White Papers to develop software program that can train students to respond to an oil spill throughout numerous geographic regions.  The software program should include the logistical and operational management of response resources.  Parameters to be addressed and modeled should include oil fate and behavior of the oil as well as the local meteorological, oceanographic and hydrologic conditions.  The software program should provide training to the student on the most efficient and effective use of available resources, as well as the possible impact the spill may have on the environment. The software program should be intuitive and easy to use. (4)  Research on the Use of Chemical Herders for Operational Oil Spill Response.  The MMS is seeking White Papers that will provide research and experimental testing data on the use of chemical herders to facilitate and improve response to an oil spill on the OCS.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey and/or through a series of field tests, including experimental oil spills.  (5)  Development of Less Destructive Shoreline Flushing Techniques.  One of the goals in spill response is to minimize harm to the environment and shorten the time for recovery.  Past experiment has shown that aggressive shoreline flushing methods can harm the environment and slow recovery.  The MMS is seeking White Papers that will use laboratory scale or meso-scale experiments, spills of opportunity, or other innovative methods to develop new or improve existing shoreline flushing techniques that are effective, less invasive, and that minimize destruction to the environment.  (6)  Improve In Situ Burn Residue Cleanup.  Physical properties of burn residues depend on burn efficiency and oil type.  Efficient burns of heavy crude oils generate brittle, solid residues (like peanut brittle). Residues from burns of thick crude oil slicks are more likely to sink than residues from burns of thin slicks of the same crude oils, because higher-molecular weight compounds concentrate in the residue as the burn progresses.  Results of laboratory tests suggest the possibility that, for about 40 to 60% of crude oils worldwide, burn residues may sink.  Only a very short time window is available for surface recovery of residues that eventually sink, but this recovery option could be effective, since residues are readily recovered either manually or with sorbents. Once the residue sinks, recovery options are few, logistics-intensive, and ineffective.  MMS is seeking White Papers that would improve the collection and recovery of in situ burn residue.  (7)  Oil Spill Chemical Dispersant Research.  The MMS is seeking White Papers that will provide scientifically rigorous, experimental research data relating to the use of dispersants to respond to oil spills on the OCS.  Specific areas of interest are:  *Oil spill response priority areas and data gaps delineated in the 2005 National Research Council report "Oil Spill Dispersants: Efficacy and Effects.  *Dispersant research conducted during experimental oil spills.  *New technologies and monitoring protocols for determining the factors that indicate "effective dispersion."  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to oil spill response, safety and pollution practices related to offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues.  Multi-year funding of projects is acceptable.  HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, an original, five (5) hard copies, and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF format on CD shall be submitted to U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170, ATTN:  Debra Bridge, not later 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Friday, July 20, 2007.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price purchase order to Comark Corporation, 93 West Street, Medfield, Massachusetts 02052.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The U.S. Navy has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers of LCAC SIUs and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the !  same units for the remaining SLEP craft.  This qualification program involved extensive testing to ensure 100 percent compatibility with the LCAC navigation systems. Currently, the SIU, manufactured by Comark Corporation, has been installed on all completed SLEP. This sensor system, as previously installed, is integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the SLEP replacement gear.  Any other sensor system would require extensive re-development and testing costs that could not be recovered through competition. It is essential that the SIUs on the remaining SLEP LCACs be identical to the current SLEP sensor systems to ensure the logistics chain established for the SLEP LCACs can be reused. Comark Corporation as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is uniquely qualified to provide these items.

<DESC>On April 18, 2003, the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) forwarded to the Commission SECY-03-0059, "NRC's Advanced Reactor Research Program."  This document provided the staff's assessment of NRC's advanced reactor technical infrastructure development and safety research that would be needed to support the review of new and advanced reactor applications planned and envisioned at that time.  A new draft was created recently "Advanced Reactor Research Program" (Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System, ADAMS, ML070740637) which identified several research tasks under the thermal-fluids and accident analysis technical areas; the first of which is the completion of R&D phenomena tables for a generic high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) design.  This involved an assessment of the current knowledge base associated with the identified phenomena to aid in developing analytical tools and technical bases to perform safety analyses and regulatory reviews, and the scope of technology development needs to support HTGR licensing, including both air-cooled and water cooled reactor cavity cooling systems (RCCSs).  

Under this requirement, the contractor shall capture all contributing heat transfer mechanisms that impact the heat rejection capacity of the RCCS: radiation, convection, and conduction for both the air-cooled and water-cooled designs.  The selected tools have to be consistent with the large scale of and RCCS, as well as the operating regimes expected during normal and accident conditions.  Simulations shall account for changes in the heat rejection capability of the RCCS induced by heterogeneous boundary conditions, e.g., coolant mass flow rate and temperature distribution at the inlet, vessel heat flux discontinuities, flow obstructions, and emissivity variations.  Special attention shall be given to the influence of dust on local heat transfer phenomena.

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be eighteen (18) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about June 1, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The EPA/ORIA/R&IE Center for Environmental Restoration, Monitoring, & Emergency Response (CERMER) under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Ludlum Instruments, Inc. of Sweetwater, TX for 35 M19 Portable Micro-R Meter (Part #48-1615).The meters are used for low level Micro R gamma survey.The justification for a sole source purchase order is as follows.ORIA/R&IE needs specialized detection equipment to be used during the deployment of the RadNet-Deployable  National Radiological Monitoring Stations, as R&IE is tasked with supplying field instruments to deployment personnel who operate the RadNet-DNRMS.The handheld detection equipment will be used to determine ambient background reading specific to radiation detection, specifically, gamma ambient  radiation, prior to setting up a deployable unit. The consistency of this handheld equipment and familiarization between agencies is vital to an effective operation.Personnel in the field must be able to competently operate the equipment, to repair the equipment, and to have coordinated usage  between field operators.In the twenty years that R&IE has depended upon Ludlum instruments, R&IE has developed a familiarization with the equipment that has become the basis for internal standard operating procedures, allowing for consistent training of staff and uniform maintenance - a uniform  maintenance which relies upon interchangeable Ludlum parts already in R&IE's inventory and calibration contracts currently in place.NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if  received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting specialist at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Bart Ostro, Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, Oakland, CA to prepare a written report on the associations between five traffic exposure metrics and three respiratory outcomes among children in the Kim et al. 2004 study. 1)  The primary respiratory outcome is asthma in the last 12 months as reported by Kim et al. in 2004.  If available from the questionnaires, two additional outcomes shall be reported: persistent wheeze in the past 12 months and  lifetime history of asthma.  2)  The traffic exposure metrics are (a) continuous distance to nearest major roadway (constructed in a manner similar to Janssen et al. 2003), (b) continuous traffic volume for nearest major roadway (constructed in a manner similar to Janssen et al. 2003), (c)  categorical distance to nearest major roadway (constructed in an manner similar to McConnell et al. 2006), (d) traffic volumes within circular buffers (constructed in a manner similar to Nicolai et al. 2003) and (e) a binary indicator of a roadway with 50,000 vehicles per day within 150 meters  (constructed in a manner similar to Green et al. 2004).   3)  The associations shall be estimated adjusting for the same covariates and strata used in Kim et al. 2004, and are to be reported as regression beta, standard error of beta, odds ratio, and 95% confidence interval for every combination of  outcome and exposure metric.  To assess the impact of potential confounding, the report shall also provide the crude regression beta and standard error of beta for the univariate models (unadjusted associations).  The report shall also provide the regression betas and standard errors for the linear  nitrogen dioxide exposure variable previously presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in Kim et al. 2004.  The data set being analyzed is one of five data sets selected as meeting the following criteria:  1) A peer-reviewed publication of a large children's cohort that examined  respiratory health affects of an exposure metric related to mobile-source air pollution.  2) A common use of nitrogen dioxide as an air pollution exposure metric either within the same cohort or in a similar cohort in the same area.  3) A well-conceived, alternative exposure metric related to  proximity-to-source that could be replicated by the four other selected studies. Analysis of the other four data sets is being procured by the Government under other sole source procurements.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one  responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   Dr. Ostro is the principal investigator of the study, the author of peer-reviewed articles for this study, and is uniquely familiar with the analytical and reporting needs of the study.  The period of  performance is expected to be from one year, from July 2007 to June 2008.    This is a non-commercial purchase.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this  announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.   Submit your response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Rebecca Clausen, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Bert Brunekreef, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands to prepare a written report on the associations between five traffic exposure metrics and three respiratory outcomes among children in the  Janssen et al. 2003 and Brauer et al. 2002 studies.  1)  The two respiratory outcomes are (1) lifetime asthma and (2) recent wheeze.  These are the same respiratory outcomes reported by Janssen et al. in 2003 and by Brauer et  al. in 2002.   2) The traffic exposure metrics are (a) continuous distance to nearest major roadway (constructed in a manner similar to Janssen et al. 2003), (b) continuous traffic volume for nearest major roadway (constructed in a manner similar to Janssen et al. 2003), (c) categorical distance to  nearest major roadway (constructed in an manner similar to McConnell et al. 2006), (d) traffic volumes within circular buffers (constructed in a manner similar to Nicolai et al. 2003), and (e) a binary indicator of a roadway with 50,000 vehicles per day within 150 meters (constructed in a manner  similar to Green et al. 2004).  3)  The associations shall be estimated adjusting for the same covariates used in the previous studies (Janssen et al. 2003 and Brauer et al. 2002), and are to be reported as regression beta, standard error of beta, odds ratio, and 95% confidence interval for every  combination of outcome and exposure metric.  To assess the impact of potential confounding, the report shall also provide the crude regression beta and standard error of beta for the univariate models (unadjusted associations).  The report shall also provide (i) the regression betas and standard  errors for the log-linear distance to the nearest major roadway and linear traffic volume for nearest major roadway previously presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in Janssen et al. 2003; and (ii) the regression betas and standard errors for the linear nitrogen dioxide exposure  variable previously presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in Janssen et al. 2003 and in Brauer et al. 2002.  The data set being analyzed is one of five data sets selected as meeting the following criteria:  1) A peer-reviewed publication of a large children's cohort that examined  respiratory health affects of an exposure metric related to mobile-source air pollution.  2) A common use of nitrogen dioxide as an air pollution exposure metric either within the same cohort or in a similar cohort in the same area.  3) A well-conceived, alternative exposure metric related to  proximity-to-source that could be replicated by the four other selected studies. Analysis of the other four data sets is being procured by the Government under other sole source procurements.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one  responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   Dr. Brunekreef is the principal investigator of the study, the author of peer-reviewed articles for this study, and is uniquely familiar with the analytical and reporting needs of the study.  The period of  performance is expected to be from one year, from July 2007 to June 2008.    This is a non-commercial purchase.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this  announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>B -- Develop Recruitment, Coordination and Administration of Hispanic Immigrant and American-born worker surveys
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-000HCCEC-2007-44082
<RESPDATE>070407
<ARCHDATE>07192007
<CONTACT>Margaret Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Phone (412)386-6431, Fax (412)386-6843, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Cincinnati Research Laboratory intend to issue a request for quotation (RFQ) for recruitment, coordination and administration of Hispanic immigrant and American-born worker surveys for tailoring OSH training for Hispanic immigrant workers.

Background

Hispanic immigrant workers (HIW) are injured at significantly higher rates than their American born counterparts underscoring the need for improved OSH safety training resources.  The intervention effectiveness literature suggests that culturally tailored OSH trainings for immigrant workers are more effective than simple translations of existing English language interventions. This study will collect information from recent (<2 years in U.S.) HIW regarding their OSH training histories, risk perception, risk acceptance and adjustment strategies and use it to tailor OSH training interventions for HIW employed in the construction industry.

Project Objectives

To better understand the differences in prior occupational safety and health (OSH) training, risk perception, risk acceptance and work adjustment strategies between recent (< 2 years in U.S.) Hispanic Immigrant Workers (HIW), non-recent (?? 5 years in U.S.) Hispanic Workers (NRHW), and American Born Workers (ABW) by administering 300 surveys (100 to HIW, 100 to NRHW, and 100 to ABW) The results will be used in subsequent phases of the study to develop a culturally sensitive OSH training program for HIW in construction and to evaluate the effectiveness of culturally tailored OSH training modules as compared to untailored OSH training modules for HIW in construction.

Scope of Work

The purpose of this contract is to provide services for the recruitment, coordination and administering of 300 surveys to Hispanic immigrant and American born workers regarding occupational safety and health training.  The surveys will be administered in a community with an established Hispanic population (Santa Fe, New Mexico).  A total of 300 surveys (100 to HIW, 100 to NRHW, and 100 to ABW) will be administered in Santa Fe.  Respondents for both the English and Spanish surveys will be employed in blue-collar, working class jobs such as, but not limited to, meat packing, food service, or construction.  To ensure that a broad range of perspectives are represented the respondents in each group will be stratified by gender so as to ensure that half of the respondents in each category will be women and half will be men.  Within the scope of this contract, the logistics of recruiting participants for the surveys will include providing any compensation to the participants for their time completing the survey, if deemed appropriate.

Description of Specific Tasks or Phases

Task 1:  Develop recruitment/survey administration plan.
The contractor will be responsible for developing a plan detailing how the recruitment and administration of the survey will occur.  The plan should include details on recruiting methodology including, but not limited to, how potential participants will be identified and approached for participation in the study, examples of recruitment materials used in the study, planned geographic scope (within the designated city) of recruiting efforts.  Particular attention will be given to how recruiting efforts will ensure that a broad range of industries and respondents are represented in the sample.  The plan should also include details regarding the administration of the survey including, but not limited to, where the survey will be administered (i.e. in respondent??s home, at a community festival, at a scheduled time in an office, etc.), how the data will be recorded and stored until delivered to NIOSH, and who will administer the survey.  Special attention will be given to how respondents?? privacy will be protected during the interview.  The plan should also include a schedule for completion of the data collection.  The survey instrument itself will be developed by the NIOSH researchers.

Task 2: Assemble team of survey administrators.
The contractor will recruit the required number of survey administrators as called for in the plan developed in Task 1 above.  The survey administrators should be familiar with the local Hispanic immigrant community and basic survey administration procedures.  The contractor will host a one day workshop to provide an opportunity for NIOSH researchers to review the data collection tool with the survey administrators.   The contractor will oversee general logistics of the workshop related to the host facility, including but not limited to: providing scheduling reminders and driving directions to participants and ensuring basic provisions (refreshments, lunch, and bathroom facilities). In addition, the contractor will be responsible for informing the survey administrators of the recruiting plan and coordinating the day to day logistics of the data collection.    

Task 3: Recruit survey respondents and administer surveys.
The contractor will recruit respondents and administer 300 surveys (100 with HIW, 100 with NRHW, 100 with ABW) to workers from a broad range of industries to identify the unique aspects of the HIW experience.  HIW respondents should have been born in Latin America, have been in the United States less than two years, have no more than a 12th grade education, and be currently employed.  NRHW respondents should have been born in Latin America, have been in the United States for at least five years, have not more than a 12th grade education and be currently employed.  ABW respondents should have been born in the United States, have no more than a 12th grade education and be currently employed.  In addition, all three groups (HIW, NRHW, ABW) should be stratified by gender so that an equal number of interviews are conducted with men and women in each group.  The contractor will be responsible for managing all logistics related to the data collection including but not limited to; ensuring the surveys are being administered properly, ensuring that the respondents meet the qualifications listed above, collecting and storing the completed surveys until they are delivered to NIOSH, and managing the efforts of the survey administrators and paying them for their work.

Recruitment will be performed until a minimum of 300 (100 with HIW, 100 with NRHW, 100 with ABW) surveys have been completed. The contractor must also be able to set up a mechanism for providing each respondent with compensation for his/her time. 

Special Considerations

In order to ensure the quality of the data the contractor will have 1) strong ties to the immigrant community in an established community, 2) recruited participants for occupational safety and health research in the Latino immigrant community in an established community, 3) administered health related surveys in the Latino immigrant community, and 4) bi-lingual capacity to administer surveys to both English and Spanish speaking respondents.
		           
The acquisition is being processed under FAR part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  The entire scope of work will be addressed in the solicitation package (RFQ) number 000HCCEC-2007-44082 available on or about July 6, 2007.   Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Responses shall contain no more than 10 pages total.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

<DESC>This synopsis superceeds Synopsis # N00421-07-R-0012 posted on Feb. 9, 2007 and is replaced with Reference Number N00421-07-R-0012REV1.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for Lean Six Sigma Continuous Process Improvement (LSS CPI) support for the Department of the Navy (DoN), to include all Navy and Marine Corps installations and deployed assets as well as associated DoN Enterprise interfaces.  The contractor shall provide the following: LSS CPI deployment consultation and project coaching; classroom and computer-based training with certification in LSS CPI; and analogous tools, methodologies, and principles to cost effectively maximize organizational effectiveness, efficiencies and cultural change through a comprehensive, fully integrated, multi-tiered LSS CPI program.  The objectives for this effort are to support DoN transformation by developing, deploying and institutionalizing LSS CPI concepts, skills, tools, and methodologies to reduce costs, decrease cycle time, and increase quality and innovation.  This unrestricted procurement will enable the DoN to become self-sufficient for sustainment through LSS CPI intellectual property and a train-the-trainer process by training civilian and military personnel.  Some of these personnel will be trained to the levels of Black Belt and Master Black Belt so that they can become qualified DoN LSS CPI instructors who can in turn train other DoN personnel in designated LSS CPI concepts.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611430 and the Federal Supply Code is U099. 
The Naval Air Systems Command will host an Industry Day on Wednesday and Thursday, 21-22 March 2007 to provide interested parties with additional information and solicit feedback on its DoN LSS CPI requirement.  Day one will be to present and discuss the Government?s requirements.  Day two is reserved for companies to have one-on-one discussions with the Government.  Industry day will be held at the Southern Maryland Higher Education Center, Center Hall Building II, Patuxent River, MD from 0900 to 1600 on both days.  Interested attendees must pre-register by e-mail to Ms. Jessica Nelson at jessica.nelson@navy.mil or facsimile (301) 757-2526 with a copy to Ms. Jessica Flynn at jessica.t.flynn@navy.mil, facsimile (301) 757-2526.  Please provide the individual?s name, company, phone and e-mail address.  Attendance is limited to five (5) individuals per company due to space limitations.  Only individuals that pre-register are guaranteed seating.  Day two is reserved for one-on-ones in 30 minute increments.  Companies interested in a one-on-one should request a time-slot and provide the names of the individuals who would like to attend.  Time slots are limited for the one-on-one discussions so only those offerors that register and request a time-slot will be guaranteed.   	The Government intends to publish a bidders list to encourage subcontracting opportunities.  As a result, please provide the name and phone number of the primary point of contact for your company.   
A copy of the DRAFT RFP will be posted on the NAVAIR hompage at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ by 9 March 07.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This synopsis is for a noncommercial engineering effort to Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C, 401 Lee Blvd., Ft. Eustis, Virginia 23604-5 577.  POC Ms Sandra Schuck, Contract Specialist, 757-878-4819.  AATD is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.2 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein and the referenced supplemental package.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may permit extensions to the proposal submission date.  INTRODUCTION The Army desires to transition its aviation fleet to Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), as directed by the Aviation Logistics Transformation Strategy and the Army CBM Plus Plan. This BAA is responsi ve to the Armys plan to mature embedded diagnostics and prognostics for CBM. Current maintenance is reactive to faults, not proactive, resulting in an excessive logistics support burden and high O&S costs. Technologies are required to provide aviation pla tforms the ability to accurately assess health and project failure of critical aircraft components, based on actual usage in operational environments. The Armys S&T goal of decreasing O&S cost by reducing maintenance, which was derived from the Rotary Win g Vehicle Technology Development Approach and the Aviation S&T Strategic Planning Workshops, supports this transition to CBM.  The OSST 2013 aircraft-level metrics are 50% Reduction in Inspections/ Flight Hour, 12% Reduction in Maintenance Labor/ Flight Ho ur, 15% Increase in Component Mean Time Between Removals and less than 5% False Removal Rates. A 2005 fielded Army rotorcraft serves as the baseline for the OSST metrics. This BAA describes 6.2 Applied Research needed to advance the state-of-the-art and en able a follow-on 6.3 Advanced Technology Development effort, in which the 2013 metrics will be demonstrated.  The Operations Support & Sustainment Technologies (OSST) program will develop and demonstrate diagnostic, prognostic, and system health assessment  technologies to support the Army goal and enable transition to a CBM based philosophy. Specific OSST objectives are reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance, expansion of serviceability criteria, extension of life or time between overhaul, an d prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance. Many technical opportunities exist to enable implementing condition based maintenance; however there are several key technical challenges. High fault detection accuracy ne eds to be achieved with minimal false alarms. A wide range of aircraft components and failure modes need to be monitored with limited sensor data and a minimal weight penalty. Accurate estimates of remaining useful life for components across varying usage and environment are required. Open systems architecture and use of common data standards are required. Aircraft integration of on-board data collection, processing, and storage shall be considered. Various technologies such as physics of failure modeling, residual strength/life prediction, wear prediction, performance models, system level reasoners and anomaly detection may be used to address these challenges. This program will result in a series of technologies that can be transitioned to support the imple mentation of CBM. For this program transition is defined as the continuation of technology development through a future advanced technology demonstration for potential fielding on current and future Army rotorcraft.   This BAA is limited to 6.2 Applied Res earch. Efforts under this BAA will develop and mature promising technologies that enable a real-time assessment of health or integrity obtained from sensors and  other data sources to improve diagnostics and prognostics capabilities. Through this effort, technologies are expected to be matured to a TRL 4 (Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment). Testing shall be conducted to demonstrate t he accuracy and robustness of developed technologies. A follow-on competitive 6.3 effort to continue development and demonstrate the 2013 OSST metrics is anticipated to start in FY11. REQUIREMENTS.  Technical Description:  The Government is seeking OSST th at reduce the future maintenance burden, reduce O&S costs, and enable implementation of CBM methodologies. Specifically, the Government desires to advance the state-of-the-art by investing in the development of technologies to allow: reduction of inspectio ns and preventative maintenance; expansion of serviceability criteria; extension of life or time between overhaul; prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance. Six rotorcraft technology areas, listed below, are identif ied as investment areas for OSST Applied Research. Technology area investments are expected to contribute to the OSST 2013 aircraft-level metrics; however not required to achieve the metrics in total. Offerors shall describe a clear path for transition and  quantifiable operations and support benefits, relative to the 2013 metrics.   Propulsion: Efforts in this technical area shall develop prognostic capabilities. Efforts shall develop the ability to determine the remaining useful life of engine mechanical c omponents, controls, sensors and wiring, and provide feedback for mission planning and maintenance scheduling.  Drive Systems & Mechanical Components: Efforts shall focus on prognosis of mechanical failures. Much effort has been put into detecting gear and  bearing failures through vibration and numerous techniques are documented. Proposed tasks shall extend the current work to develop prognostic methods with improved accuracy. Electrical Power & Wiring: Efforts shall focus on the automated diagnosis and fau lt isolation of wiring and prognosis of electrical components. Aircraft wiring is difficult and time consuming to fault isolate and can also drive component false removals. Intermittent faults or signal degradation due to wiring are challenging maintenance  problems. Structures: Structural maintenance labor and cost will be reduced by more accurately calculating service life expended and managing the helicopters structural integrity. Applied Research is needed to develop and mature enabling technologies tha t fuse aircraft usage data, virtual sensor data, and damage sensor data with structural load data to assess local and global structural health and integrity. Included in this need is the capability to detect, locate, and characterize damage (corrosion, fat igue cracking, battle damage, etc.) and predict useful service life, based upon damage severity and growth.  Rotors & Dynamic Components: Rotors and their associated dynamic components operate in high-cycle and environmentally challenging conditions. Drivi ng factors that result in rotor system maintenance actions are: fatigue in the rotor hub dynamic components (spherical bearings, bushings, pushrods, root end couplings, etc); operational impact damage (ballistic and FOD) in the rotor blade; and out-of-trac k and/or out-of-balance rotors. Applied Research is needed to develop and mature technologies that manage and mitigate these maintenance drivers through prognostics. The Army desires the capability to predict the onset of rotor system failure based upon di agnosed component level faults, actual usage, and operational environments. Additionally, the Army desires technologies that enable continuous onboard adjustment of rotor track-and-balance, since current procedures require a maintenance action and improper  track-and-balance can lead to several severe problems (e.g., blade delaminations, cracking of elastomeric bearings, and failure of mounting bolts). Flight Cont rols & Hydraulics: Current Army rotorcraft procedures require frequent maintenance actions to be performed on flight control and hydraulic system components, such as hydraulic lines, servos, pumps, bell cranks, bearings, electronics, and actuators. Because  of these components complexity and inconvenient locations on the aircraft, maintenance actions, such as inspections, become very time consuming. Applied research is needed to develop and mature technologies that take into consideration actual usage, dete cted faults, and performance degradations as a means to predict remaining useful life. This will not only reduce the current maintenance burden associated with flight control and hydraulic systems, but also offer potential to extend the service life of cur rently life-limited components. Deliverable Items:  All awards will require delivery of the following data items or deliverables: (1) Program Plan, (2) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (3) Final Report, (4) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis an d may require (5) Design Review Briefing Charts, (6) Test Plans (7) Test Reports (8) Software Development Plan, and (9) Software Requirements Specification.

<DESC>On April 18, 2003, the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) forwarded to the Commission SECY-03-0059, "NRC's Advanced Reactor Research Program."  This document provided the staff's assessment of NRC's advanced reactor technical infrastructure development and safety research that would be needed to support the review of new and advanced reactor applications planned and envisioned at that time.  A new draft was created recently "Advanced Reactor Research Program" (Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System, ADAMS, ML070740637) which identified several research tasks under the thermal-fluids and accident analysis technical areas; the first of which is the completion of R&D phenomena tables for a generic high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) design.  This involved an assessment of the current knowledge base associated with the identified phenomena to aid in developing analytical tools and technical bases to perform safety analyses and regulatory reviews, and the scope of technology development needs to support HTGR licensing, including both air-cooled and water cooled reactor cavity cooling systems (RCCSs).  

Under this requirement, the contractor shall capture all contributing heat transfer mechanisms that impact the heat rejection capacity of the RCCS: radiation, convection, and conduction for both the air-cooled and water-cooled designs.  The selected tools have to be consistent with the large scale of and RCCS, as well as the operating regimes expected during normal and accident conditions.  Simulations shall account for changes in the heat rejection capability of the RCCS induced by heterogeneous boundary conditions, e.g., coolant mass flow rate and temperature distribution at the inlet, vessel heat flux discontinuities, flow obstructions, and emissivity variations.  Special attention shall be given to the influence of dust on local heat transfer phenomena.

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be eighteen (18) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about June 1, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

Under this requirement, the contractor shall select tools and techniques that are appropriate for the length scales and characteristic Re numbers that correspond to interstitial spaces in both pebble and prismatic HTGR cores and have the capability to simulate local phenomena in the core ranked high by the R&D phenomena tables.  The suitability of selected tools and techniques shall be demonstrated by investigating the velocity and temperature field responses to several parameters expected to dominate the thermalfluidic behavior in the core.

Evaluation of Medicare Part D Organizations
Customer Service Call Centers and Pharmacy Call Center Contractor

INTRODUCTION
This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Beneficiary Choices (CBC).  CMS is seeking capability statements from small business firms (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that are qualified to support CMS in evaluating Medicare Part D prescription drug plan contractors? availability and responsiveness to their enrollees and contracted pharmacy providers in providing requested information over the telephone.  

Offerors should note that this is not primarily an Information Technology (IT) action.  IT tasks and requirements performed under this SOW are incidental.  The primary focus of this call center evaluation is on: (1) designing a statistical/scientific approach for sampling Part D Sponsors? beneficiary and pharmacy call centers within a CMS defined accuracy level (calculation of average hold time with an error margin of ?10 seconds); (2) utilizing live telephone interviewers with computer assisted telephone interface systems to make survey calls to beneficiary and pharmacy call centers to determine hold time and disconnection rates; and (3) providing reports and research datasets to CMS based on data collected from surveillance calls.

The Medicare prescription drug benefit, which started January 1, 2006, is provided by stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) that have contracted with CMS to provide only Part D benefits and by Medicare Advantage plans (MA-PDs) which offer combined Medicare Part A/B benefits along with Part D prescription drug benefits. The organizations that provide Part D benefits are required to meet certain standards for providing information to their enrollees and contracted providers.  An integral part of these requirements is that each organization be responsive when enrollees and providers call on the telephone for information.  Providing timely information is often critical for doctors and pharmacists to help provide Part D enrollees with the prescriptions they need.  In the 2007 contract year, there are currently a total of 552 stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan contracts being surveyed by CMS and these contracts operate a total of 414 beneficiary phone lines and 171 pharmacy help lines.
  

TASK DESCRIPTION
Tasks under this contract will focus primarily on developing a surveillance research protocol, making survey calls to Part D sponsors? beneficiary and pharmacy call centers, and providing reports and data files to CMS based on the findings.  More specifically, offerors will be required to demonstrate that they have extensive and successful experience in providing a full-range of key activities conducting health services research using statistical sampling and operating/managing an outbound call center.  These tasks include:

A.  Study Protocol for Call Center Surveillance: The contractor shall develop a written research protocol which describes their process for completing calls to Part D sponsors? beneficiary
call centers and pharmacy technical support call centers, including when various timestamps will occur during a call to determine the call hold time.  Note: this must include protocols for navigating lines which utilize interactive voice recognition (IVR) or other automated answering systems.  The contractor shall also determine the number of calls required to be placed to each Part D sponsor?s beneficiary call center and to their pharmacy technical support call center on a weekly basis to ensure an accuracy level for calculation of average hold time with an error margin of ?10 seconds, accounting for the number of beneficiaries enrolled in plans offered by the sponsor.  CMS estimates that during survey weeks, the total number of calls should be approximately 7,500 to 10,000 per week for the beneficiary lines and 4,000 to 6,000 per week for the pharmacy lines.

B.  Pilot Survey of Call Centers:  The contractor shall conduct a 1-week pilot survey of Part D sponsors? beneficiary call centers and their pharmacy technical support call centers using their CMS approved protocol.  At the discretion of CMS, a second pilot week may be required based on findings from the first week pilot.

C.  Analysis of Call Center Pilot Survey Data:  The contractor shall provide a report to CMS which includes an analysis of all data obtained from the call center pilot survey and shall also supply CMS with call-level raw data files from the pilot survey upon request.  Additionally, the contractor shall compare pilot survey findings to Part D sponsors? actual call data, both at the summary level and individual call level.

D.  Survey of Call Centers:  Once revisions are made to the research protocol following input from the pilot survey and CMS provides final approval, the contractor shall begin surveying Part D sponsors? beneficiary call centers and their pharmacy technical support call centers.  The contractor will complete the proposed number of calls to every Part D organization?s customer service line and pharmacy help line over the course of a one-week period (5 business days) as specified in their CMS approved protocol.  The contractor will repeat this same calling process for all Part D organizations, but with the Part D organizations re-ordered in the call schedule to ensure that the same organizations are not called on the same days / times as the prior week.  The contractor will continue this process for a minimum of 4 weeks per calendar quarter (specific weeks to be surveyed each quarter will be specified by CMS) and at additional times as specified by CMS, until the end of the contract period.

E.  Analysis of Weekly Call Center Survey Data:  For each organization called, the contractor shall report on the results of the inquiries.  The call center contract summary reports shall include current week, quarter-to-date, and year-to-date statistics for each contract?s beneficiary call center and pharmacy call center.  These reports shall contain the organization contract number, organization name, range of call dates, Part D sponsor type (e.g. PDP or MA-PD, or code to represent), Call center type (beneficiary or pharmacy), total number of call made to the organization, number of successful calls, number of unsuccessful calls, average IVR time, average hold time, minimum time to answer, median time to answer, maximum time to answer, percent of disconnected calls, percent of calls with a hold time of 30 seconds or less, and other information relevant to assessing performance as specified by CMS.  In addition, a second report shall be provided that describes for each contract the reasons for unsuccessful calls, and the count of calls associated with each of these reasons for the current survey week.  

F.  Call Center Call-Level Datasets: The contractor will supply CMS with an electronic file in SAS dataset file format (.sas7bdat) containing the call level data for each of the calls that were dialed to each organization?s beneficiary call centers and pharmacy technical support call centers for each week of call surveillance.

The project includes the foundations for 3 antennas, back-up power generator, UPS and pri ority 2 security systems (double fencing, sensors and cameras reporting to SF central monitoring system.)   The acquisition method is negotiated procurement.  Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required.  The basis for award is Best Value Tradeoff.  This process permits tradeoffs among costs or price and non-cost factors and allows the Gove rnment to award to a superior offeror which is not the lowest priced offer but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offeror so as to justify payment of a higher price.  It is the Governments intent to award based on initial  offers without discussions.  Relative weighting of technical and price is as follows:  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  Evaluation factors may consists of the following: (1) Past Performance on projects similar in nature; (2) Specialized experience in constructing DoD facilities that serve as part of the world-wide satellite communications network, employing high reliability power and HVAC systems, foundations and utility interconnectivity with satellite communications antennas, and control & monitoring for restricted access to the complex ; (3) Key Personnel, including construction members;  (4) Project Management Plan that emphasizes communications with and responsiveness  to multiple users that will share the facility; ability to respond to user-installed equipment technology upgrades throughout the construction period, and aggressiveness in meeting or exceeding the construction period timelines, and (5) Small Business Uti lization Opportunities.  The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive. Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,000,000.00.  If the offeror is a large business, the firm wi ll be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package.  The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  Failure to submit an acceptable sub-contracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contact. To be acceptable, the plan must adequately address the six required statutory elements and provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmatively questions A through H of appendix DD, Part 2, AFARS 19.705.  The Los Angeles  District subcontracting goals are specific percentages of the contractors total planned subcontract amount.  The goals are as follows: 51.2% with small business, 8.8% with small disadvantaged business, 7.3% with woman owned small business, 1.5% with servi ce disabled veteran owned small business and 3.1% with hub zone small business.  All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged fi rms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.

<DESC>This is a sources sought, not a request for a proposal.   A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.  The Government intends to operationally evaluate up to one portable hand held and/or one bench top X-Ray Fluoroscopy (XRF) instrument(s) provided by each invited vendor who chooses to participate in an operational evaluation at the US Navy Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRC-SE) located at Jacksonville FL.  Though the intent is to evaluate one handheld and/or one desktop unit from each vendor, the Government reserves the right to evaluate additional units or no units nominated by a specific vendor.  Each vendor?s XRF system(s) will be evaluated over a one day period and will involve a vendor selected test evaluator and government personnel test evaluators for material analysis of multiple component lead finishes and solder alloys on high reliability aerospace avionics and electronics.  The vendor will have the opportunity to demonstrate and provide appropriate training up to a 4 hour period on their equipment operation.  Details will be included with the vendor invitation. 

This sources sought is not a request for proposal.  The determination of which vendor(s) item(s) to invite for the XRF operational evaluation is solely at Government?s discretion upon review of specifications and associated data (vendor advertisements and/or other performance assessments that a vendors hardware may have previously been involved) provided with the vendors statement of interest. Due to the associated use of this equipment by government personnel, all IEEE/ANSI C95.1, OSHA Regulations 29CFR 1910.96, FDA regulations 21 CFR chapter I sub chapter J, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Rule and Regulations 10 CFR 20 must be met.  It is the intent of the government for these portable, handheld and/or desktop XRF analyzer units, to be used during/with standard operational procedures without causing any additional limitations or burdening the ?users? to any additional radiation, hazardous material and/or safety risks.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in developed, model hand held and best model desk top XRF equipment by providing their response of willingness to participate in the evaluation described in this synopsis and a description of the equipment systems performance/data sheet, limited to five pages for each type system. We request that each vendor provide each of their XRF analyzers optimum performance capability specifications by utilizing existing libraries, additional/special collimators, adjustments and calibrations within the system and/or supporting equipment by COB 06 July 07. Vendor participation cost is totally born by the vendor and the government assumes no liability for time, travel, equipment, supplies or other direct or indirect costs incurred by the vendor in the planning, preparation or conduct of this XRF operational evaluation.  There is no implied or actual promise to purchase.  Vendors selected for the XRF operational evaluation will be contacted by the Government to schedule their participation.  Government intent is to perform the operational XRF evaluation from 23 July 2007 thru 10 August 2007 time frame.  A formal report of this evaluation will be released within 60 days after the final evaluation to all vendors participating.  Notice of willingness to participate and equipment specifications should be sent via email to linda.p.nelson@navy.mil.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
?	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
?	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
?	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
?	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
?	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
?	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent?s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission. 

IV.  EVALUATION CRITERIA

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The 412 TW/AFFTC, Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing two Digital Pulse Processors equal to the salient characteristics listed to meet the form, fit, and function of existing systems. 

SPECIFICATIONS:  DIGITAL PULSE PROCESSOR


The Digital Pulse Processing System provides the following basic signal processing functions:
?	Preprocessing
?	Pulse data acquisition
?	Deinterleaving of pulse data
?	Library matching
?	Correlation and update of emitter status with previously received data
?	Measurements of scan period/rate and type upon command
?	Reporting emitter data and status
?	Reporting pulse data for real-time displays
?	Selects processing parameters such as bandwidth, threshold, CW definition and others
?	Primary communications interface to/from the operator workstation


The Signal Processing System has the following display types:
?	System Set-up Displays

This system processor receives an RF input supplied by the user.  Within the unit, the RF is converted to IF by a Microwave Tuner.  The IF is digitized by a digital receiver which forms burst records of pre-detected data containing pulse information.  Algorithms extract the pulse features from each pulse and store the data from each pulse in a Pulse Descriptor Word.

The Pulse Processor Unit is a standard 5.25? high, 19? rack mount VME chassis containing a microwave tuner, a digital aperture VMW signal processor module and a system interface VME circuit card that provides for the system electrical interfaces.  The digital signal processor module consists of a digital aperture PMC Module and an IF Conditioner PMC Module both mounted on a dual CPU Signal Board Computer.

The Microwave Tuner requires 2 slots, the System Interface Board requires 1 slot and the Signal Processor Module requires 1 slot.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNPOSIS FOR:  Market Research to determine potential sources to perform "Microstructural Characterization of Materials" for a future BAA announcement.  
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/ML), Materials and Manufacturing Directorate seeks potential sources for a sixty (60) month, $15M program to perform the microstructural characterization component of AFRL/ML's in-house research and development mission as well as develop new and improved materials characterization tools, techniques, methods, and equipment within the Materials Characterization Facility (MCF) located at WPAFB, OH (on-site at WPAFB).

Because the nature, make-up and use of advanced aerospace materials are diverse and complex, considerable variation in the materials characterization research is anticipated.  There are numerous tools and techniques for use in materials characterization research:  analytical electron microscopy; high resolution electron microscopy; electron optics methods using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), electron microprobe (EMPA); dual beam focused ion beam milling coupled with SEM (DB-FIB), electron and x-ray diffraction investigations, orientation and chemical imaging microscopy in the SEM; scanning probe microscopy; all forms of optical microscopy and macroscopy; image analysis and simulation; crystallography; and quantitative metallography.  Specimen preparation techniques such as sample thinning, replication, precision sectioning, electropolishing, low and high angle ion milling, microtoming, sample coating, electroplating, and metallographic polishing, as well as etching have been used.  It is envisioned that microstructural characterization research will also require advances in the state-of-the-art, necessitating the development of new and unique tools and techniques in addition to the employ of those tools and techniqes enumerated above.  Materials to be characterized include, but are not limited to, the following materials and their associated composites:  aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, titanium alloys, nickel alloys, steels, refractory metals, advanced intermetallic compounds, niobium alloys, ceramics - monolithic, high-temperature structural ceramics based on oxides, nitrides, silicides, carbides, and borides, nanocrystalline and/or multi-layered component systems of metallics, intermetallics, and ceramics, organic materials - including structural and nonstructural polymers as well as biological materials, functional graded materials, electronic materials, sensor materials, coating and paint materials.  This program contains two tasks, which are to be conducted concurrently.  Task I consists of materials characterization research that develops  and advances the state-of -the-art for characterization techniques, methods and equipment.  Task II then applies these advanced characterization tools to novel materials, including, but not limited to those listed above.  The contractor must have personnel with the training and experience necessary to support the effort described above.  These personnel will be required to work on-site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541710. The small business size standard is 500 employees.  The purpose of this synopsis is to provide the Air Force technical team with the ability to determine capabilities of potential respondents.  The Air Force is contemplating a small business set aside based on the responses received.  If this acquisition is set aside for small business, the resulting contract will contain the clause FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting which requires (for services) that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  Responses to this synopsis shall include a demonstration of the offeror's ability to perform at least 50 percent of the effort.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted.

<ARCHDATE>08272007
<CONTACT>charrhee, 315-772-4107
<DESC>Market Survey: Sources are sought that can provide or equal products for brand name components as described below.  The New York District intends to solicit and award the following construction projects for Fort Drum, New York, entitled Unit Opera tions Facility, 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Transformation Phase II, 2nd BCT Transformation Phase II, 3d BCT Transformation Phase II, Engineer Battalion Unit Operations Facility, Military Police Battalion Unit Operations Facilities, and Military Police B arracks.  The project itself will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation. However, the project may potentially include a brand name component.  This notification serves three purposes: 1) To notify potential offerors of the Governments intent to sol icit a brand name only component under a future construction project; (2) To identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and; and (3) Notification of the Governments intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, for Monaco  system and Advantor Systems Corporation, as described below.   The Monaco system and Advantor system are embedded in the Construction projects, which projects will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring the Monaco system or Advantor system will be sole source if no sources are able to provid e a compatible system.  In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.   The synopsis is for planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is the  only document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the government's intent.  A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or systems(s) in th e event an or equal product is not submitted for consideration.  In such instances, the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring brand name comp onents will be sole source if no sources are able to prove an or equal product.  Supplies will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.   SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT (Monaco Enterprises):  the project includes Brand Name only equipment for building fire alarm radio transceivers manufactured by Monaco Enterprises. These projects with their many state-of-the-art building components require reliable  receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems.  Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  Only one model has been determined to be acceptable, and the appropriate model will be selected per building requirements.   The BTX-F Fire Alarm Building Transceiver is functionally designed for specific Government fire department operations. Monaco Enterprise Inc. provides 24/7 technical support and in-service training of Installation personnel for operation and maintenance inclusive. It is paramount that this system be carefully coordinated to maintain overall system integrity and capabilities. The required features of the BTX-F Fire Alarm Building Transceiver are as follows: Hardwire line or narrowband radio communication w ith any of the D-21 Fire Management System, Narrowband radio is FCC certified for narrowband operation and meets the requirements of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Freq uency Management, Radio communication with the D-21,  Provides audio and fire alarm overrides for mass notification per UFC and NFPA,  Provides eight relay driver outputs and four supervised zone inputs and Eight onboard open-collector relay driver outputs .  Provides four supervised fire zone inputs for connection to fire detection and monitoring devices located within 15 feet of the BTX-F; these are supervised for open (trouble), short (alarm), single-ground fault, and double-ground fault conditions, Four zone LEDs (one for each zone) reflect the condition of the zones: trouble, ala rm, or normal, Status LEDs reflect the status of the BTX-F: general alarm, general trouble, system fault, in-communication, carrier detect, transmit, primary power, battery boost charge, and battery float charge, Supports up to seven (7) zone expansion bac kplanes into which fire expansion cards can be plugged.  Each zone expansion card provides four zone inputs. Each expansion card has five LEDs: the PWR LED indicates power is being supplied to the card; the remaining four LEDs indicate the status of the fo ur zone inputs. Each BTX-F can support up to 60 zones and eight (8) relay outputs with 14 zone cards installed.  One selectable RS-422/RS-485 port for communication with peripheral equipment or connection to a local access controller.  One (1) full-duplex RS-232 ports used to program the BTX-F via connection to a laptop computer.  115 or 230 Vac power monitored with automatic switchover to backup battery power that provides standby power; the number of hours depends on the battery. Self test, stuck transmit ter disconnect, reset, acknowledge, and battery reconnect switches with the following features: Local audible alert, Real-time clock and calendar, 	Fits in single or doublewide enclosures; the enclosure size depends upon how many expansion cards are needed .  Factory Mutual approved.  SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT (Advantor):  the project includes Brand Name only equipment for intrusion detection systems (IDS) by Advantor Systems Corporation.   It has been determined that the Advantor system is the best and the most economical alternative to b e compatible with the existing system.  Fort Drum currently uses the OzVision Remote Video Solutions for seamless integration into the post central security monitoring station. Advantors intrusion detection system provides seamless integration into the po st central security monitoring station. Advantage Suite for Networks (ASN) has been tested and certified by the USAF as an approved Command, Control, and Display system for both Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Entry Control Systems (ECS). This approv al spans the protection of PL 1-4 resources, some of the nation's most critical assets.  Advantor's mission-proven performance in electronic monitoring, integrates monitoring applications and security functions, and promotes efficiency and limitless expand ability. ASN includes monitoring and programming software for Advantage Access, Advantage Plus intrusion detection systems, Oasis Graphics, and Advantage Pass & ID.   Any vendor wishing to provide a system that is compatible or equal to with the existing Monaco Enterprises Inc. BTX-F Building Transceiver or Advantor System must provide a copy of its brochure and any other data by ten (10) calendar days from date of is sue, no later than 27 June 2007 to Major Charlotte H. Rhee, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, N.Y., New York 10278-0090,  (315) 772-4107, FAX No (315) 772-1566 or charlotte.h.rhee@usace.army .mil. This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation.  This project will be solicited at a future date.

<SUBJECT>C -- Environmental Compliance and Analysis Services (ECAS) Program Ceiling Increase
<DESC>Air Combat Command Acquisition Management and Integration Center (AMIC)/PKA,  formally ACC CONS/LGCE, intends to increase the Environmental Compliance and Analysis Services (ECAS) IDIQ multiple award contracts, estimated program ceiling from $200M to $280M. This acquisition was originally announced via FedBizOpps on 21 Oct 03 and included work efforts necessary to manage and execute Title I, Title II, and other A&E services primarily for environmental projects including restoration, conservation, planning, compliance and pollution prevention.   Work also included as a secondary requirement,  traditional A&E services.  The resulting contracts were competitively awarded and resulted in award of seven (7) contracts with an overall estimated program ceiling of $200M with the contract performance period for all seven (7) contracts ending 28 Sep 2011.  Due to the increase in demand  by ACC and other DOD agencies to use  this program and unpredicted Hurricane Katrina Recovery efforts, it has become necessary to increase the program ceiling by an additional $80M to allow usage of the ECAS program thru 28 Sep 2011.  Provide comments via email to the attention of  helen.vaughn@langley.af.mil within 10 days of this announcement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source contract to Regional Economic Models, Inc.(REMI)for its impact model system for evaluation of LACPR studies. This is a special notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with the  format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice 6.302-1 Only one responsible source available, and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, a ny firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 7 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comp ly with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluate, however a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are receive d, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer will proceed with awarding a firm-fixed price contract to Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI). Point of Contact for this requirement is LaTanya Johnson at Latanya.E.Johnson@hq02.usace.army.mil Scope of Work or Service(s ) & Requirement(s): Introduction\Background During the course of calendar year 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was directed to participate in a multi-agency effort (the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force or IPET) to investigate an d analyze the catastrophic impacts of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans metropolitan area. Part of this effort involved the evaluation of direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts. A review of available economic impact models was conducted and it w as determined that due to the severity and significance of impacts induced by Katrina, one readily-available model was best suited to evaluations needed for studies. The economic impact model selected and applied for IPET studies was the modeling system de veloped by Regional Economic Models, Incorporated (REMI). The REMI system was licensed for IPET studies for a period of six (6) months, a sufficient period of time to complete studies for IPET and to evaluate whether the model was\is analytically sound and  appropriate for further studies of catastrophic conditions. Post review of the REMI system indicates that it remains the only readily-available impact model reasonably applicable to catastrophic impacts sufficiently severe to result in significant restruc turing of a regional economy. Due to the nature and scope of catastrophic impact evaluations for LACPR studies, it has been determined that the REMI model system should be purchased or licensed via sole source for application to LACPR studies. Additional j ustification for sole-source acquisition of the REMI system is based on the critical need to build on lessons learned and findings and methods developed during the course of IPET studies, and for efforts to maintain continuity, comparability and consistenc y of analytical technique and procedures to analytical approach applied to LACPR studies. The request for purchase is for upgrade of licensure for the initial six-month licensure (acquired in 2006) to specifications of a perpetual license. The estimated co st for upgrade of licensure is based on standardized price schedules of the vendors products for a modeling system with specifications equal in all regards (except the length of licensure) to that applied for prior IPET studies including a 70-sector level  of detail and specifications for geographic coverage and delineation(s). To provide additional detail and clarification for specifications of licensure required for LACPR studies, pertinent content of the scope and specifications as set forth for acquisit ion of the REMI system for IPET studies has been reproduced below. Needs for LACPR studies which are exceptions or deviations from the requirements or specifica tions specified for IPET concern: a.) Users to which licensure for access and technical support is to be granted. and b.) Duration of technical support. The duration of technical support will be for the standard one full calendar year that is integral or s tandard for a perpetual license from the day the REMI modeling system is furnished, successfully installed, and verified as fully functioning and operable. Individuals or entities to whom licensure is to be granted include the following three (3) entities listed below. The licensure for access by entities number 1 and 3 is to be temporary (i.e., less than six months) while the licensure for access and use by entity 3 (the New Orleans District Office of USACE) is for perpetual use. Given at time of award. De liverables from REMI, Inc.: Granting of licensure as requested for the REMI model system within an expedited timeframe is essential to compliance with established schedules for LACPR.

Three (3) fully-functional site license installations (including requisite printed documentation and software for computerized set-up and installation is to be forwarded within six (6) bu siness days inclusive of the business day that the notice to proceed (NTP) is given by the Government contracting officer or contracting officers authorized representative (COR). Materials are to be mailed or forwarded via expedited next-day mail to the t echnical points of contact identified above. The time period for licensure and use shall be as defined above for each entity extending from the day a given licensed node or copy is installed and determined to be operating properly or as intended. Actual ph ysical installation of each license and system will be performed within a reasonable and deliberate timeframe by the designated technical points of contact as noted above or by their respective support personnel. Each user version, license, and\or installa tion of the REMI system provided shall be fully capable or operational once installed and remain operational commensurate with privileges granted under licensures as specified and include allowances for requisite technical support. Requisite technical supp ort allowances shall include technical support for proper installation and operation of the model in accordance with the companys standard client practices. Each version\license\installation will be identical in technical specifications and capabilities, and shall be of the most current version, edition, or release available at the time of purchase. The provided modeling system(s) for each license will be calibrated to the maximum extent possible for currency of base input data (i.e, population, earnings o r revenues by industrial or business sector, etc.) as maintained or in the possession REMI, Inc. at the time of the NTP. Accordingly, each provided license or installation will provide for the application or functionality of all features or modes of operat ion possible by the REMI system subject to limitation only by the regions or regional delineations and sector level of detail as specified for acquisition. The purchase agreement shall include the ability (and will clearly define related costs) for the opt ion to later upgrade the licensure agreement for the regions specified to perpetual ownership and\or increase in the sector level of detail (i.e., from 70 to 169 sectors) for the version in force at the time of acquisition. Accordingly, it shall be further  understood that: The Defined period(s) of performance: a.) Forwarding of licensure, software system(s), and requisite documentation no later than six (6) business days from the notice to proceed (NTP) with physical receipt no later than eight (8) business  days from the NTP. b.) Licensed availability and functioning for all licenses or installations of the REMI system (and requisite technical support) for the reg ions as defined for a unlimited period for the copy assigned to the New Orleans District Office and period of 183 calendar days (for parties identified at time of award) from initial proper and fully-functioning installation. Given the description of requi rements, the total period of performance for technical work and model support of LACPR is estimated at approximately 365 days for the perpetual license (210 days for the two limited licenses) from the notice to proceed (NTP) with allowances for forwarding,  time for installation, and the described periods of operation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being requested as a Request for Quote (RFQ); solicitation number is H92244-07-T-0078, as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract with fixed unit prices.  The anticipated award date is on or about 13 July 2007.  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17, effective 14 June 2007.  North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 541511 applies to this procurement. This procurement is unrestricted.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  FOB point is Destination.

The Command Security System currently utilizes GeoRover software.  The brand name products are procured to maintain system continuity.  GeoRover is a proprietary system.  The incorporation of non-GeoRover software into the network infrastructure will cause system degradation and will void current warranties and support coverage.  Changing the system configuration to accommodate a new software suite for imagery would require additional personnel and training to support the new equipment.  This approach would negatively impact the Government in terms of cost and time.

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS)  provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation  Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

The Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will play a central role in the development and implementation of strategies for humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other designated vulnerable groups for the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  The Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be a member of the Technical Assistance Group. Located within the Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM), the Technical Assistance Group (TAG), was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster relief mandate.? TAG is sub-divided into various groups that address Food Security, Shelter and Settlements, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The incumbent will also play a central role in the implementation of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) IDP and protection policies and coordination within USAID, and in conjunction with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, donors, and non-governmental partners.  The Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will have substantial knowledge of current development and disaster theory and research regarding IDPs and protection, and practical experience in the field, working with private voluntary organizations (PVOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or international organizations (IOs) at resettlement or disaster response locations.

OBJECTIVE

The Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be assigned to the TAG and will work closely with the staff of the Program, Policy, and Management (DCHA/PPM) office in the DCHA bureau.

Contacts will be with the Department of State and USAID employees at all levels, and specifically with Protection staff in the PPM office,   United Nations (UN) staff, representatives of other donor governments, consultants, researchers and educators, and officials of non-governmental organizations.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings in Washington, foreign capitals, and in the field.

* Coordinate with the OFDA Technical Assistance Group's IDP/Protection Specialist, DCHA/PPM Protection staff and with the Humanitarian Coordination Specialist within the Office of the Director in the development of IDP and protection policies, strategies, and program standards;

* Coordinate with the various DCHA offices, including the Office of Transitions Initiatives (OTI), Office of Food for Peace (FFP), Office of Democracy and Governance (DG), Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Office of Program, Policy, and Management (PPM) on IDP and Protection issues;

* Work with counterparts in other donor organizations to exchange information, establish meetings, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities regarding IDPs; and coordinate these activities with relevant DCHA offices;

* Articulate IDP and protection policies to personnel within OFDA, the DCHA Bureau, USAID Missions and other USAID Bureaus, and to other U.S. Government agencies, other donors, and implementing partners, through participation in conferences, speaking engagements, and field visits;

* Participate in OFDA grant review process as needed, including reviewing partner proposals and providing technical recommendations;

5.  There is no indication of the current state of this equipment.  Is it all currently operable or does it need complete overhaul? Currently operable/ coming off warranty in August 07

7.  Is there currently an incumbent doing this work?  Yes

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being requested as a Request for Quote (RFQ); solicitation number is H92244-07-T-0078, as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract with fixed unit prices.  The anticipated award date is on or about 13 July 2007.  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17, effective 14 June 2007.  North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 511210 applies to this procurement. This procurement is unrestricted.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  FOB point is Destination.

The Command Security System currently utilizes GeoRover software.  The brand name products are procured to maintain system continuity.  GeoRover is a proprietary system.  The incorporation of non-GeoRover software into the network infrastructure will cause system degradation and will void current warranties and support coverage.  Changing the system configuration to accommodate a new software suite for imagery would require additional personnel and training to support the new equipment.  This approach would negatively impact the Government in terms of cost and time.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for an Internal Displacement and Protection (IDP) Advisor in Washington, DC.

Ladies/Gentlemen:

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications (Optional Form 612 only) from qualified U.S. citizens to provide personal services as an Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor under a personal services contract, as described in the solicitation.

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide the attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

   Approximately 3-4 feet.

I17D01   52.217-9C03   OPTIONS FOR INCREASED QUANTITY   (OCT 2001)   DSCC 
(a) The Government may require delivery of additional supplies in accordance with the CLIN(S) identified as Option CLIN(S) in Section B.
(b) The option may be exercised in one or more increments at the time of award and after award during the period of the contract delivery schedule minus 14 days.  The total amount of supplies ordered under this option will not exceed the maximum specified in Section B but may be less than the maximum amount.  A written notice mailed or otherwise furnished by the DSCC contracting officer to the contractor within the time specified shall constitute an exercise of the option.  Delivery schedule is defined as follows:
(1) The delivery schedule means a period of time from the date of award to the last scheduled delivery date of any CLIN, including CLINs added by modification (other than option exercises) as stated in the modification.
(2) Modifications extending the delivery schedule shall be interpreted as extending the option period, unless otherwise stated in the modification.
(3) Modifications accelerating the delivery schedule shall NOT be interpreted as reducing the option period, unless otherwise stated in the modification.
(c) Prior to option exercise, the contractor voluntarily may reduce option price or improve delivery time by written notice to the contracting officer.
(d) Delivery of supplies ordered pursuant to this clause shall be required within the same number of days as the original contract quantity, computed from date of option exercise.  However, if First Article Testing is required under the contract and the First Article Test has been waived or passed at time of award of the option, delivery time for option quantities shall be reduced by the amount of time specified for reduction based upon FAT waiver as specified under contract clauses I09D04, DSCC 52.209-9C07 or I09D06, DSCC 52.209-9C11.  If additional time is required for delivery of the option quantity the contractor must submit a written request to the contracting officer within 10 days after receipt of option notice.
(e) If the specifications are changed prior to option exercise or if the option exercise specifies different delivery points or packing requirements other than stated in the contract, the price and delivery time for the option exercise quantity shall be subject to adjustment under the clause entitled "Changes".
(f) The Government may reject an offer as nonresponsive if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the basic requirement and the option quantities.  An offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated for other work.
NOTE:  FAILURE TO SUBMIT AN OFFER ON THE OPTION CLIN(S) IN SECTION B MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF BID/OFFER.
