RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:  Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL)

A.	INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) development program.  Based on research the Government has funded and/or reviewed, it is believed that the requirements of this BAA procurement can best be met with a cryogenically cooled, Ytterbium-doped YAG (Yb:YAG) laser that operates at ~1.03 microns.  However, the Government is also willing to consider other DPSSL approaches.  The program will consist of two phases: Phase 1 will cover a system performance trade assessment of the BAA technical requirements, preliminary laser system modeling and simulation, risk reduction experiments, a “compelling” sub-scale laboratory breadboard demonstration of the proposed laser technology/architecture approach at the contractor’s facility, and an Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL) brassboard preliminary design review (PDR); Phase 2 will cover laser system modeling and simulation, a laboratory breadboard demonstration at the contractor’s facility of the full ATILL output performance requirements, and an ATILL brassboard critical design review (CDR).  The Phase 1 system performance trade assessment will allow the contractor to perform a detailed evaluation of their proposed design, covering system performance and packaging parameters such as laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.  The primary purpose of the system performance trade assessment is to arrive at a design for airborne applications that optimally balances laser technical performance with system packaging, maintainability and reliability constraints.  As part of the trade assessment, the contractor will also generate an error budget tree for identifying and monitoring key technical performance and packaging issues during both phases of the technical effort.  The brassboard design effort in Phases 1 and 2 is for a ruggedized, flight-qualifiable laser brassboard (TRL 6) that meets all technical performance and packaging requirements listed herein.  Deliverables will be those called out in BAA AL-2006-01.  Delivery of a ruggedized brassboard laser is not part of this program solicitation.  The total program budget for the technical effort is approximately $16.5M for Phase 1 and $20M for Phase 2 (~$36.5M total funding).  Depending on funds availability and quality of the BAA technical proposals, one or two contractors may be funded for the first phase, which should be for approximately 30 months at ~$8M per effort.  Only one contractor may be funded for the second phase (~24 months).    The projected start date is near the end of the second quarter GFY06.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Stephen G. Post, MDA/AL, 505-853-3811, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt. Dax Presuto, MDA/ALK, at 505-846-0758.  In addition, the DoD proposal evaluation team may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the proposal evaluation process.

B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
Any contractor funded for both phases under this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser  development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, risk reduction experiments, and laboratory breadboard testing to demonstrate a 5.5 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser to the DoD.  During both phases, all modeling and simulation shall be validated by risk reduction experiments and testing of the laboratory breadboard (subscale during Phase 1, and full-scale during Phase 2).  Emphasis will be placed on solid-state laser architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability (for airborne platforms), and ruggedness.  The contractor(s) is(are) expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution.

The DoD is specifically interested in approaches that address the following diode-pumped solid-state laser output performance goals (in descending order of importance):
1)	Wavelength: The laser wavelength shall be at ~1.03 microns.
2)	Radiance (W/cm^2-sr): The Radiance (Brightness) of the laser output beam shall be greater than or equal to a laser of 5.5 kW average power with a Beam Quality (BQ) better than or equal to 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) as directly measured by a far-field power-in-the-bucket (PITB) technique, where the bucket extent is nominally defined by the energy/power contained in the laser’s far-field central lobe.  The laser shall have a minimum average output power of 5.0 kW over the entire run-time duration specified in paragraph (a) below.
3)	Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): The laser’s PRF shall nominally be 5.0 kHz, variable plus or minus 15 percent with a controlled PRF slew rate of up to 1500 Hertz per second.
4)	Pulse Length: The laser’s full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) temporal pulse length shall be less than or equal to 15 ns, with a goal of less than or equal to 5 ns.  As part of the laser system trade study during the first contract phase, the effect of pulse length on laser system performance and reliability will be investigated.
5)	Coherence Length: The laser output temporal coherence length shall be less than or equal to 5 centimeters (goal of 2 centimeters).
6)	Polarization: The laser output polarization shall be linear with a contrast ratio of greater than 100 to 1.
7)	Beam Jitter: The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 10% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the FWHM power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table—the table will not induce jitter in the laser head.
8)	Pulse-to-Pulse Energy Stability: The pulse-to-pulse energy variation shall not exceed plus/minus 2 percent.

Additionally, the DoD is interested in approaches that address the following design-to diode-pumped solid-state laser brassboard goals (in descending order of importance):
a)	Run Time: The laser brassboard shall be designed to operate continuously for at least 300 s (goal of 600 s).  All performance measurements on the Phase 1 sub-scale and Phase 2 full-scale laboratory devices (power, beam quality, efficiency, beam jitter, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 s.  Additionally, the device shall be capable of reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., ten or more twenty-second bursts with five-second periods of non-lasing between bursts, then return to stand-by).  In this mode of operation, the requisite run time only includes the sum of the “laser on” periods.  The laser power supply and cooling system recycle times are mission and platform dependent; recycle time impact on system weight, volume, efficiency, etc. will be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 system performance trade assessments.
b)	Start-Up Time: The laser start-up time, defined as the time required to transition from a stand-by condition (defined during the Phase 1 system performance trade study) to a condition where all output requirements are met, shall be no more than 1 s.
c)	Wallplug Efficiency: The laser wallplug efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 12%, where wallplug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used to operate the laser.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
d)	Output Power-To-Mass Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration efforts, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their laser brassboard design will meet an output power-to-mass ratio requirement of 12 W/kg (goal of 15 W/kg) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total system mass of less than 459 kg (goal of 367 kg).  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers (no externally available thermal reservoir should be assumed), power supplies, controller, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchanger manifolds, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with an optical mounting assembly, cover, and other necessary fixtures.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
e)	Output Power-To-Volume Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration phases, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their deliverable brassboard laser will meet an output power-to-volume ratio of 0.01 W/cm^3 (goal of 0.02 W/cm^3) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total volume of less than or equal to 0.55 cubic meters (goal of less than or equal to 0.28 cubic meters).  See item (d) for a definition of what constitutes the laser system.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
f)	Temperature Range: The ambient operating temperature range of the laser brassboard design for ground-based and airborne applications shall be 15 to 35 degrees C, and its storage temperature range shall be –50 to 50 degrees C.  Herein, “storage” is defined as the periods between tests or missions (e.g., an aircraft in an unheated aircraft hanger).
g)	Humidity: For ground-based operations, up to 95% humidity from 2 to 35 degrees C; for airborne applications, up to 85% humidity from 15 to 35 degrees C.
h)	Operating/Storage Pressure: –1,000 ft to 10,000 ft.
i)	Platform operating angles, acceleration, vibration, shock, and other operating/storage parameters will be provided early in Phase 1 during the system performance trade assessment effort.  As a minimum, offerors should provide a laser system design that is compatible with an airborne environment similar to a 747-type aircraft.

For item (2), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser’s Radiance (Brightness), output power and beam quality and what the possible technical issues are in making such measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide in their proposal a discussion of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared).  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made for items (3) through (8) and (a) through (i).  Again, it is noted here that, though a laser system brassboard design shall be developed through PDR level during Phase 1 and CDR level during Phase2, there is no laser system brassboard deliverable for the future BAA.

As noted previously, the program shall be carried out in two phases.  Each phase shall be priced separately, with Phase 1 offered as the basic contract and Phase 2 offered as a contract option.  It is also noted here that hardware procured and used in Phase 1 may be also used in the Phase 2 contract option (if exercised).

As part of the brassboard laser system design effort, the contractor will ensure through appropriate evaluation/assessment techniques that the laser beam’s output characteristics do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at a Government facility or on a specified platform.  This effort will be included in the Phase 1 system performance trade assessment, which as mentioned previously will also cover laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.

For the intended BAA solicitation, flight qualifiable means that the laser brassboard is designed to undergo flight qualification testing with minimal system hardware/software changes required.  This approximately corresponds to a Technology Readiness Level 6.

The proposal expectations (not for the RFI) are as follows: Offerors shall limit the length of their Technical Proposals to 75 pages or less, including all pages (no exceptions).  Additional information on required fonts, page formatting, etc., may be found in the BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions (to be added when the BAA is published).  Cost proposals will be limited in length to 50 pages or less, including all cost sheets, basis of estimates and other supporting information.  Cost proposal preparation instructions will be included in the RFP package when the BAA is issued.  As part of the Technical Proposal, offerors must demonstrate through past performance and corporate/institutional capabilities that they possess the resources and technical capabilities necessary to perform successfully on this BAA.  This should include identified experience designing, developing, fabricating, and testing ruggedized (TRL ~6), fieldable, high Radiance, high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser systems.  The Government encourages any interested, qualified not-for-profit laboratories/institutions (e.g., FFRDCs) or Universities that are based in the United States to team, or form suitable partnering relationships in conformance with their by laws and applicable statutes and regulations, with qualified industrial partners on this solicitation.  The intent of the intended BAA is to develop the technology and industrial base necessary to build a ruggedized, ~1.03 micron wavelength, high average power, diode-pumped solid-state laser system (TRL 6) that may be procured through a follow-on contract.

Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are due no later than Close of Business on *** 21 October 2005 ***.

<DESC>TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING ACQUISITION SUPPORT (TEAS V):  Reference Sources Sought Notice posted 2 May 2005, the acquisition strategy for the TEAS V acquisition has been determined.  After considering the integrally related nature of TEAS Program engineering support tasks and objectives across the full spectrum of TEAS customers and throughout the weapon engineering life cycle from the concept and technology through development and sustainment with testing at every stage, the acquisition strategy is to award a single contract using Full and Open competition, with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710 (small business size standard for the TEAS V acquisition is defined as one with <1,000 average “number of employees”, as the term is defined by FAR 19.101).  This is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) task ordering contract with approximately 126 task orders in the initial ordering period.  The Government intends to award a basic contract with four option periods.  Projected contract award date is mid April 2006 with a transition period to the task ordering period of performance which is 11 June 2006 to 30 September 2007.  A Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) was posted 16 September 2005 on FedBizOpps.  Formal RFP release is tentatively scheduled for 7 Oct 2005.

The small business subcontracting requirement escalates by one percent (1%) with the exercise of each subsequent option period (i.e., 32% for option period 1; 33% for option period two; 34% for option period 3; and 35% for option period four.)  The contract type is cost-plus-award-fee and cost-reimbursement (with no-fee).  Cost reimbursement (no-fee) line items are included for travel, relocation expenses, other direct costs, OCONUS mission essential salary/logistics support privileges/incentive, furniture, office equipment and other related items, and if necessary, off-base facility. 
The Air Force Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB [AAC/ENR (PKZA)] will be holding a Pre-Solicitation Conference (i.e., Industry Day) for prospective TEAS V offerors on 22 September 2005 from 0800-1100.

FAR Clauses: 52. 212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a si!  ngle provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need!   for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be su re to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 !  Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue Prospectus A and Prospectus B for the operation of guided mountaineering and other guided snow and glacier based activities at Mount Rainier National Park.  There will be a total of three separate Contracts awarded through these Prospectuses, one under Prospectus A and two under Prospectus B.  The existing Concession Contract between the National Park Service and the existing Concessioner expires on December 31, 2006, or until such time as a new Concession Contract is awarded, whichever occurs first.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51, has determined that the existing Concessioner is a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded under Prospectus A because they are a qualified outfitter and guide service.  There is no preferred Offeror for the two Contracts to be awarded under Prospectus B.  The length of the new Contract will be for ten (10) years.  Any offer, including that of the existing Concessioner, must be received by the Concessions Program Manager, National Park Service, Pacific West Region, 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, CA 94607 no later than ninety (90) days after the date of publication of this notice in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a Concession Contract.  Both Prospectuses will be issued February 3, 2006, for a 90-day response period under the terms described in each Prospectus, with proposals due on May 4, 2006, no later than 4:00 p.m.  There is a printing cost recovery charge of $75 per set to be delivered via Federal Express or $60 per copy if picked up in person.  Checks or money orders (no cash accepted) must be payable to the National Park Service; and you must include a business address (no post office box) to receive a Federal Express package.  Prospectus Packages will be available by contacting Kim Gagliolo, Concession Management Analyst, Pacific West Region Concessions, 1111 Jackson St., Oakland, CA 94607.  Telephone inquiries may be directed to 510-817-1368.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI6024 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent. This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-06. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intend to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisition procedures with the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative of Toronto, Canada for rare HIV patient samples. NIAID investigators are studying the pathogenesis of HIV in infected individuals. A critical part of this research entails identification of molecules on CD8+ T cells of long-term non-progressors in whom viral replication is inhibited by the host immune system in the absence of anti-HIV therapy (Z01 A1000885-02 Immunologic and Virologic Strategies Directed Toward HIV Infection). Identification of such molecules may play critical role in design of novel antiviral therapy.  In addition, the researchers are examining latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells that are implicated in eradication of virus in infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy (Z01 A1000851-05 Role Of Viral Reservoirs In The Pathogenesis Of HIV Disease).  These specimens can only be obtained from 0.2 % of the general HIV patient population and the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative has a large cohort of these.  Previous services with the CIRC has identified 80 patients meeting our study requirements including 25 long-term non-progressors, and 40 who have been receiving anti-viral therapy for 8 years or more.  Many of the aforementioned patients have been reviewed by the NIAID, and currently, our research is wholly dependent on the use of these specimens, which require repeated collation of cells from these patients as part of longitudinal analyses.  It is critical that the samples be obtained continuously from these patients for follow-up research studies. Each patient will be subjected to determination of his or her CD4+ T cell count, plasma viral load, and disease status.  Contractor will provide 110 medical specimens from designated HIV patients with sample preparation to include Leukopheresis, lymphocyte isolation, in-vitro testing, and cryo-preservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $12.5 million dollars. These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Bethesda, MD. This is a fixed-price contract and the FOB terms are “Destination.” The anticipated period of performance will be 03/01/06-02/28/07.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items. FAR 52.225-3. Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items. Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) is required. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award] Registration is available via the Internet at www.CCR.gov . Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Monday, February 20, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- GENETIC FACTORS IN BIRTH DEFECTS
<SOLNBR>RFP-NIH-NICHD-2006-02
<RESPDATE>042406
<CONTACT>Jason Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-402-6775, Fax 301-402-3676, Email willjas@mail.nih.gov - Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-6960, Fax 301-402-3676, Email cn43m@nih.gov
<DESC>The Pediatric Epidemiology Section (PES) of the Epidemiology Branch (EB), an intramural research group within the Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on identifying risk factors for abnormal childhood development.  An area of particular interest is the genetic contribution to birth defects.  The PES conducts much of its research via contracts, collaborating scientifically with the Contractors.  

The mapping of the human genome has made it possible to identify genes that are etiologically important in birth defects.  For example, the knowledge that folate was important in the etiology of neural tube defects (NTDs) led to the identification of a variant in the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase that increases the risk of having an NTD.  There is great potential for finding other gene related birth defects because recurrence risks indicate that there is a genetic component and because of the enormous genetic variability in the human population–any two individuals have approximately 3,000,000 differences in their genomes.
 
One of the limiting factors in this research area has been the availability of samples from a sufficient number of affected subjects (or families).  Because the etiology of many birth defects is multifactorial and because the penetrance of these genes is low (sometimes because of environmental factors), large numbers of cases must be studied to identify risks.  The possibility that defects are the result of gene-gene interactions also demands larger sample sizes to identify enough subjects with the combination of alleles in question.

Even a relatively common type of birth defect, such as a neural tube defect, occurs in only about one (1) pregnancy in 1000.  Hundreds of cases of any birth defect are required to address even the simplest of research questions.  Other birth defects of interest are much less common than neural tube defects. Therefore, a large underlying population is needed to identify enough defects of interest.  Many important defects are too uncommon for even a large institution to accrue enough cases to conduct etiologic investigations.  There are few resources available to redress these problems.

Therefore, the NICHD intends to contract with an institution to acquire from a large population in a defined geographical area (e.g. births within a given state): 1) already collected samples containing DNA from a large number of children who have major birth defects and medical documentation sufficient to describe the birth defects; 2) already collected samples containing DNA from normal control children; 3) any and all existing data currently in the possession of the resultant Contractor on factors that may influence pregnancy outcome and birth defects. 

Additionally, as a contract option the NICHD is looking to obtain for the children who have major birth defects and for the normal control children:  1) maternal serum, plasma, amniotic fluid or other biological samples obtained during the pregnancy that produced the affected or normal control child; 2) samples containing DNA from the mothers; 3) samples containing DNA from the fathers, where maternal samples containing DNA are present.

Please note that offerors are not required to propose on the Contract Option requirements.   Offerors that elect not to propose on Contract Option requirements will still be considered for award, though there is a small (10 points) Technical Evaluation Criterion based on the Option requirements.  Furthermore, offerors that do elect to propose on the Contract Option requirements may elect to propose to provide all of the Contract Option requirements or they may elect to propose to provide just the following Contract Option requirements: #1 only, #2 only, #1 and #2, #2 and #3 or #1, #2 and #3.  

Please note that it is the intent of the Government to make only one (1) award as a result of the RFP.   This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about February 22, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Jason Williams, Contracting Officer, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Gene Silencing Section (GSS), plans to procure Quantigene Reagent Systems and Quantigene Probe Sets from Genospectra Inc., 6529 Dumbarton Circle, Fremont, CA 94555.  The GSS is engaged in the study of the RNA interference mechanism and the application of methods that study this mechanism of gene function.   An important part of the mission of the GSS is quantitating the degree of knockdown different molecules that mediate RNAi induction.  This information is required if RNAi functional data is to be interpreted correctly and the GSS has been using the Quantigene RNA assay system as part of its on-going research  to characterizing small molecules that mediate RNAi. The Quantigene RNA assay system makes use of capture plates that when combined with gene specific probes, a detection system and the RNA molecule they selectively bind to the plate.  The Genospectra Quantigene RNA assay system is unique in that it enables the use of cell lysates and allows measurement of RNA levels in a linear fashion. This is the continuation of ongoing research and it is critical that new variables not be introduced into these on-going experiments.  Genospectra, Inc. is the only known source to the NCI Researcher that can meet the aforementioned requirement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Human Genome Research (NHGRI)  intends to negotiate an award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Transgenomic, Inc., 123 25 Emmet Street, Omaha, Nebraska, 68164, to purchase assay development, scanning, and sequence characterization of selected variant of genomic DNA.    At a minimum the Government intent is to purchase assay development, scanning, and sequence characterization of selected variant of genomic DNA for approximately 400 amplicons. The proposed period of performance will consist of one twelve (12) month basic contract period.   The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the Government wishes to maintain continuity of the services received in regard to Protocol #76-HG-0338, for the renal fanconi syndrome study.  Continuity is required to avoid the introduction of new variables into the experimental results and to avoid long delays resulting from retesting of products from other potential suppliers.   Also, changing variables at this time may result in incorrect interpretation of the test result already in progress.   An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable simplified acquisition.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 339999, Size Standard 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest  which includes; a firm fixed price; documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Government?s requirements;  at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government?s minimum specifications; and a proposed delivery schedule.   The submission  will be evaluated on the content of the above documents.   The submission is due on February 17,  2006, 9:00 a.m. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNs), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offerors business size.  The Offeror must also register in the Government?s Contractor Registry System. Note: www.ccr.gov.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

<DESC>The United States Department of State will release the above referenced solicitation in approximately 60 days from todays date.  If interested, respond by e-mail to PowellHL@State.Gov.
No advance information will be provided prior to the release of the solicitation.

The scope of this requirement is for a complete range of support to the management, operations, and WRAPS application software development, delivery, deployment and maintenance of the Refugee Processing Center (RPC) in Rosslyn, Virginia and the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS).

The objective of this Task Order is to accomplish all the activities associated with providing the aforementioned support while employing industry best practices in project management and software development, including risk mitigation to ensure on-time delivery within budget and innovative techniques to minimize costs.

The challenge is supporting and maintaining WRAPS as an operational system so that there is minimal or no disruption in the timely processing of refugees, and at the same time allowing for the planned addition of features and functionality as well as responding to field-driven changes.

Rather than focus on simple operations and maintenance, DoS seeks a contractor that will bring a mission focus that provides highly effective, secure, and reliable computing and processing resources.  The winning contractor must also continuously identify methods for applying information technology to improve PRM’s mission performance and reduce program costs.  DoS places special emphasis on the contractor’s ability to proactively offer innovative solutions and look for ways to reduce the total life-cycle cost for WRAPS and the RPC, so that the savings realized from the program can be applied to benefit the processing of an even greater number of refugees.  DoS is anticipating a best-value procurement emphasizing a stable cost environment with a potential term of 5 years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. The purpose is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for the Instruments Commodity Council. The Instrument Commodity Council contemplates negotiating a performance based logistic support services contract to support the repair of the B-1B Flight Controls and CADC.  It is anticipated that this will be a firm fixed price contract based on flying hours. The Government anticipates negotiating on a sole source basis with Honeywell Inc as they have rights to the drawings for the items to be repaired.  This effort is currently being accomplished as organic repair in the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops. Honeywell will be entering into an agreement with the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops to complete the effort. It is anticipated that Honeywell will be providing the total logistics support efforts.  

 The NSN’s being repaired:

6615-01-276-8318     Stability Control and Augumentation       System (SCAS 2)		
6615-01-271-9168         FLAP/SLAT

 6610-01-269-5437.        CACD



 This sources sought synopsis is hereby clarified as follows: The noun for NSN 6610-01-269-5437 is CADC not CACD. This effort is to improve material availability, delivery, quality, cost savings and increase reliability of B-1B Flight Control Systems through Performance Based Logistics (PBL). This PBL effort incorporates the Power by the Flight Hour concept whereby the contractor is paid fixed rate per flying hour. A central tenant of PBL is the contractor is responsible for all performance outcomes. The contractor must have the necessary design, manufacturing, production in process data capable to provide the performance outcomes, predetermined levels of availability, reliability increase from technology insertion, engineering for design changes, and technical data revisions for the Honeywell International Incorporated B-1B Flight Control Systems. The essence of this PBL effort is buying performance outcomes, not the individual parts and repair actions. Instead of buying set levels of spares, repairs, tools, and data, the new focus is on buying predetermined levels of availability and increased performance of the B1-B Flight Control System. All touch labor is anticipated to be performed by the OC-ALC Depot with the support described above provided by the contractor. 
Capable sources are requested to submit electronic technical capability statements and relevant information by 17 February 2006 to Phyllis.Schmit@tinker.af.mil

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:  Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL)

A.	INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) development program.  Based on research the Government has funded and/or reviewed, it is believed that the requirements of this BAA procurement can best be met with a cryogenically cooled, Ytterbium-doped YAG (Yb:YAG) laser that operates at ~1.03 microns.  However, the Government is also willing to consider other DPSSL approaches.  The program will consist of two phases: Phase 1 will cover a system performance trade assessment of the BAA technical requirements, preliminary laser system modeling and simulation, risk reduction experiments, a “compelling” sub-scale laboratory breadboard demonstration of the proposed laser technology/architecture approach at the contractor’s facility, and an Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL) brassboard preliminary design review (PDR); Phase 2 will cover laser system modeling and simulation, a laboratory breadboard demonstration at the contractor’s facility of the full ATILL output performance requirements, and an ATILL brassboard critical design review (CDR).  The Phase 1 system performance trade assessment will allow the contractor to perform a detailed evaluation of their proposed design, covering system performance and packaging parameters such as laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.  The primary purpose of the system performance trade assessment is to arrive at a design for airborne applications that optimally balances laser technical performance with system packaging, maintainability and reliability constraints.  As part of the trade assessment, the contractor will also generate an error budget tree for identifying and monitoring key technical performance and packaging issues during both phases of the technical effort.  The brassboard design effort in Phases 1 and 2 is for a ruggedized, flight-qualifiable laser brassboard (TRL 6) that meets all technical performance and packaging requirements listed herein.  Deliverables will be those called out in BAA AL-2006-01.  Delivery of a ruggedized brassboard laser is not part of this program solicitation.  The total program budget for the technical effort is approximately $16.5M for Phase 1 and $20M for Phase 2 (~$36.5M total funding).  Depending on funds availability and quality of the BAA technical proposals, one or two contractors may be funded for the first phase, which should be for approximately 30 months at ~$8M per effort.  Only one contractor may be funded for the second phase (~24 months).    The projected start date is near the end of the second quarter GFY06.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Stephen G. Post, MDA/AL, 505-853-3811, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt. Dax Presuto, MDA/ALK, at 505-846-0758.  In addition, the DoD proposal evaluation team may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the proposal evaluation process.

B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
Any contractor funded for both phases under this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser  development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, risk reduction experiments, and laboratory breadboard testing to demonstrate a 5.5 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser to the DoD.  During both phases, all modeling and simulation shall be validated by risk reduction experiments and testing of the laboratory breadboard (subscale during Phase 1, and full-scale during Phase 2).  Emphasis will be placed on solid-state laser architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability (for airborne platforms), and ruggedness.  The contractor(s) is(are) expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution.

The DoD is specifically interested in approaches that address the following diode-pumped solid-state laser output performance goals (in descending order of importance):
1)	Wavelength: The laser wavelength shall be at ~1.03 microns.
2)	Radiance (W/cm^2-sr): The Radiance (Brightness) of the laser output beam shall be greater than or equal to a laser of 5.5 kW average power with a Beam Quality (BQ) better than or equal to 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) as directly measured by a far-field power-in-the-bucket (PITB) technique, where the bucket extent is nominally defined by the energy/power contained in the laser’s far-field central lobe.  The laser shall have a minimum average output power of 5.0 kW over the entire run-time duration specified in paragraph (a) below.
3)	Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): The laser’s PRF shall nominally be 5.0 kHz, variable plus or minus 15 percent with a controlled PRF slew rate of up to 1500 Hertz per second.
4)	Pulse Length: The laser’s full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) temporal pulse length shall be less than or equal to 15 ns, with a goal of less than or equal to 5 ns.  As part of the laser system trade study during the first contract phase, the effect of pulse length on laser system performance and reliability will be investigated.
5)	Coherence Length: The laser output temporal coherence length shall be less than or equal to 5 centimeters (goal of 2 centimeters).
6)	Polarization: The laser output polarization shall be linear with a contrast ratio of greater than 100 to 1.
7)	Beam Jitter: The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 10% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the FWHM power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table—the table will not induce jitter in the laser head.
8)	Pulse-to-Pulse Energy Stability: The pulse-to-pulse energy variation shall not exceed plus/minus 2 percent.

Additionally, the DoD is interested in approaches that address the following design-to diode-pumped solid-state laser brassboard goals (in descending order of importance):
a)	Run Time: The laser brassboard shall be designed to operate continuously for at least 300 s (goal of 600 s).  All performance measurements on the Phase 1 sub-scale and Phase 2 full-scale laboratory devices (power, beam quality, efficiency, beam jitter, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 s.  Additionally, the device shall be capable of reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., ten or more twenty-second bursts with five-second periods of non-lasing between bursts, then return to stand-by).  In this mode of operation, the requisite run time only includes the sum of the “laser on” periods.  The laser power supply and cooling system recycle times are mission and platform dependent; recycle time impact on system weight, volume, efficiency, etc. will be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 system performance trade assessments.
b)	Start-Up Time: The laser start-up time, defined as the time required to transition from a stand-by condition (defined during the Phase 1 system performance trade study) to a condition where all output requirements are met, shall be no more than 1 s.
c)	Wallplug Efficiency: The laser wallplug efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 12%, where wallplug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used to operate the laser.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
d)	Output Power-To-Mass Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration efforts, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their laser brassboard design will meet an output power-to-mass ratio requirement of 12 W/kg (goal of 15 W/kg) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total system mass of less than 459 kg (goal of 367 kg).  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers (no externally available thermal reservoir should be assumed), power supplies, controller, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchanger manifolds, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with an optical mounting assembly, cover, and other necessary fixtures.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
e)	Output Power-To-Volume Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration phases, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their deliverable brassboard laser will meet an output power-to-volume ratio of 0.01 W/cm^3 (goal of 0.02 W/cm^3) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total volume of less than or equal to 0.55 cubic meters (goal of less than or equal to 0.28 cubic meters).  See item (d) for a definition of what constitutes the laser system.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
f)	Temperature Range: The ambient operating temperature range of the laser brassboard design for ground-based and airborne applications shall be 15 to 35 degrees C, and its storage temperature range shall be –50 to 50 degrees C.  Herein, “storage” is defined as the periods between tests or missions (e.g., an aircraft in an unheated aircraft hanger).
g)	Humidity: For ground-based operations, up to 95% humidity from 2 to 35 degrees C; for airborne applications, up to 85% humidity from 15 to 35 degrees C.
h)	Operating/Storage Pressure: –1,000 ft to 10,000 ft.
i)	Platform operating angles, acceleration, vibration, shock, and other operating/storage parameters will be provided early in Phase 1 during the system performance trade assessment effort.  As a minimum, offerors should provide a laser system design that is compatible with an airborne environment similar to a 747-type aircraft.

For item (2), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser’s Radiance (Brightness), output power and beam quality and what the possible technical issues are in making such measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide in their proposal a discussion of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared).  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made for items (3) through (8) and (a) through (i).  Again, it is noted here that, though a laser system brassboard design shall be developed through PDR level during Phase 1 and CDR level during Phase2, there is no laser system brassboard deliverable for the future BAA.

As noted previously, the program shall be carried out in two phases.  Each phase shall be priced separately, with Phase 1 offered as the basic contract and Phase 2 offered as a contract option.  It is also noted here that hardware procured and used in Phase 1 may be also used in the Phase 2 contract option (if exercised).

As part of the brassboard laser system design effort, the contractor will ensure through appropriate evaluation/assessment techniques that the laser beam’s output characteristics do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at a Government facility or on a specified platform.  This effort will be included in the Phase 1 system performance trade assessment, which as mentioned previously will also cover laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.

For the intended BAA solicitation, flight qualifiable means that the laser brassboard is designed to undergo flight qualification testing with minimal system hardware/software changes required.  This approximately corresponds to a Technology Readiness Level 6.

The proposal expectations (not for the RFI) are as follows: Offerors shall limit the length of their Technical Proposals to 75 pages or less, including all pages (no exceptions).  Additional information on required fonts, page formatting, etc., may be found in the BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions (to be added when the BAA is published).  Cost proposals will be limited in length to 50 pages or less, including all cost sheets, basis of estimates and other supporting information.  Cost proposal preparation instructions will be included in the RFP package when the BAA is issued.  As part of the Technical Proposal, offerors must demonstrate through past performance and corporate/institutional capabilities that they possess the resources and technical capabilities necessary to perform successfully on this BAA.  This should include identified experience designing, developing, fabricating, and testing ruggedized (TRL ~6), fieldable, high Radiance, high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser systems.  The Government encourages any interested, qualified not-for-profit laboratories/institutions (e.g., FFRDCs) or Universities that are based in the United States to team, or form suitable partnering relationships in conformance with their by laws and applicable statutes and regulations, with qualified industrial partners on this solicitation.  The intent of the intended BAA is to develop the technology and industrial base necessary to build a ruggedized, ~1.03 micron wavelength, high average power, diode-pumped solid-state laser system (TRL 6) that may be procured through a follow-on contract.

Following are questions supporting the ATILL RFI and comments on any recommended clarifications involving the aforementioned RFI:

1)  Are the proposed ATILL technical requirements achievable with currently available technology?  Are there any technical requirements that are considered to be especially difficult to achieve with currently available technology?

2)  Are the proposed schedule and funding appropriate for the proposed ATILL technology development program?

3)  What text changes and/or clarifications, if any, are recommended for the proposed ATILL BAA?

4)  A brief explanation of company/organization/institution resources and technical capabilities available/necessary to perform successfully on the proposed BAA.


Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are due no later than Close of Business on *** 21 October 2005 ***.

<DESC>This is a testing-only notice.  Please ignore. Still just a test, pay no mind to this. Same status, just a test. For more information on "This is just a test", please refer to:  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=4144 Stiles at 937-904-7205,  Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil  ****************************************************************************  Update 4 October 2005 - Virtual Industry Day for draft RFP (imminent  release) and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for  release by 11 October 2005. A Virtual Industry Day is planned to be held  1330 EST to 1530 EST, 18 October 2005. Interested firms should review the  draft RFP, once posted, and submit written questions via e-mail to the new  buyer, Theresa Hay, Theresa.Hay@wpafb.af.mil. Submittal in advance will  ensure that questions can be answered in a timely manner during the  Industry Day. Firms need to contact the Virtual Industry Day POC, Ms.  Patricia Stiles, (937) 904-7205, Margaret.Stiles@wpafb.af.mil, to register  for the event. Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence.  ************************************************************************  Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ***********************************************************************  Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices.  **********************************************************************  Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  **********************************************************************  Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  *********************************************************************  Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005. *************************************************************  Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library.  ********************************************************* Update:  Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05  During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal  of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th  will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked  about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is  provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions  QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA KSC TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE which was posted on February 2, 2006. You are notified that Technology Areas 4 and 5 entitled "Metal Oxide Coatings" and "Atmospheric Plasma Glow Discharge (APGD) Device" respectively, are hereby added:  “4) Metal Oxide Coatings NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the application of metal oxide coatings utilizing plasma spraying.  Potential partners must have a  plasma spray system to be utilized in this collaboration, which meets the following characteristics: (1)  the ability to control the attitude of the plasma system (one possible solution is to mount the plasma gun on a robotic arm which enables 360 degree orientation of the spray); (2) the capacity to measure particle temperature, velocity and distribution within the plasma,  and finally, (3) the capacity to spray a plasma with either nano- and micron-sized particles (solid precursors) or liquid precursors. Qualifying partners must have a plasma spray system and experience in and ability to perform surface analysis (e.g., X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, etc.) of the coatings.  5) Atmospheric Plasma Glow Discharge (APGD) Device: KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development and laboratory testing of a hand-held atmospheric plasma glow discharge (APGD) device.  Specifically, KSC desires a compact device that is capable of producing stable plasmas in reactive gases such as O2 and inert gases such as He. The device must operate at temperatures that allow the plasmas to be applied to polymer surfaces without causing damage to the polymers.  Qualifying partners must have experience in manufacturing RF or microwave plasma sources, plasma diagnostics, and the use of atmospheric plasma devices for research and/or medical applications.” ***************************************************************************************** ***************************************** The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this teaming opportunity will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (a)(2)(ii), to conduct a Market Research before soliciting offers for an acquisition with an estimated value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.  The result of this RFI notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The primary purpose of this notice is to improve small business access to acquisition information, to enhance competition and identify potential small business (for contracting and subcontracting opportunities) that is interested and capable of performing the work described below.  Firms responding to this RFI should state whether they are a small business concern, as defined by SIC Code 8999 (Size Standard $6.5M).  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541620, "Environmental Consulting Services". Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Depending on the review of the responses to this RFI, MMS may issue a solicitation for a 100% small business set aside or full and open competition.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this RFI. BACKGROUND:  Since 1988, MMS and the oil and gas industry have conducted many meteorological and air quality studies for the Gulf of Mexico.  The data from the various studies differs in quality and quantity, and is not synthesized or integrated.  Neither is the data in a common database format that could be easily analyzed or queried by the MMS or State/Federal air quality groups.  If this data is incorporated into a common database, analysis could be performed to understand basic relationships between meteorology, emissions, and air quality in the Gulf of Mexico. The EPA has promulgated new national ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and regulations for regional haze.  All of these regulations will require States to perform air quality modeling for use in their State Implementation Plans (SIPS).  MMS needs to provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and coastal States with a coherent, usable meteorological, air quality dataset and analyses for the Gulf of Mexico. PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:  The proposed study would generate a dataset of more than ten years of meteorological, air quality, and emissions inventory data, along with air quality analyses for the Gulf of Mexico.  This will be used by MMS in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for all Gulf of Mexico air quality issues, and be used by the U.S. EPA and States for required air quality modeling.  Specific objectives of this study are to: (1) synthesize and integrate all meteorological, air quality, and emissions inventory data from MMS, other federal and State agencies, and oil and gas industry related studies accomplished in the Gulf of Mexico since 1988; (2) transform the like data into common formats and assemble in a commonly used data base (MS-Access); (3) evaluate data and flag data quality/limitations; and (4) perform basic analyses, i.e. Classification and Regression Tree Analyses (CART), to determine important relationships between the meteorological, air quality, and emissions variables for the air quality of the affected environments, onshore and at the Breton National Wilderness Area located just offshore of Louisiana and Mississippi. STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS:  Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality in the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, emissions formatting, meteorological modeling, EPA regulations and emissions submittal procedures, air quality analysis studies, and database management.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one, and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge required is as follows: MS-Access, Classification and Regression Tree Analyses (CART) or comparable analysis tools, mesoscale meteorological models (i.e. MM5), and emissions inventories and formats (i.e. EPA National Emissions Inventory Input Format or NIF) for air quality models. SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a response with approximately 20-page or less that provides information about the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity, and publications recorded in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES:  Your response must be delivered as: one (1) original plus three (3) hard copies and one electronic/diskette copy (CD MS/Word/PDF), total of five (5) copies.  Response due date: not later than close of business, 5 P.M. Eastern Time, 6 March 2006 at the address below: Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service Procurement Operations Branch, MS 2101 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170 Attn: Ms Olivia Adrian, Contracting Officer Phone: (703) 787-1151 or FAX (703) 787-1041 Please note that MMS is located in a secure building.  If responses are hand delivered, please ensure that the courier is instructed to use the courtesy phone in the rear of the lobby (to the right of the elevators) to call Procurement Operations Branch at extension 7-1070.

<DESC>TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING ACQUISITION SUPPORT 5 (TEAS 5).  Sources are sought to provide Advisory and Assistance (A&AS) manpower support services in a variety of engineering, technical and acquisition management disciplines for the Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB FL, Hurlburt Field FL, Holloman AFB NM, Kirtland AFB NM, Air Logistics Centers, and other related locations as required.  The AAC was created in October 1998 to provide a single focal point within the USAF for air armament.  AAC develops, acquires, tests, deploys, and sustains air-delivered munitions.  TEAS 5 will provide professional engineering services to support that mission.  The anticipated contract type is a cost-plus-award-fee with miscellaneous cost reimbursable line items.  The current ceiling level of performance is 875 man-years.  Final decision for the acquisition strategy will be made by the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Combat and Mission Support (AFPEO/CM).  Any potential small business set-asides will be considered within the requirements of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710, size standard of 1000 people.  Foreign participation is excluded.  The TEAS contractor must evaluate the designs and products of AAC’s prime systems contractors.  To ensure full access to those designs and products, the TEAS contractor must not be a competitor of the prime contractors which build air armament systems for AAC.  The TEAS contractor will not be allowed to bid on any other AAC contract, unless a waiver is granted by the TEAS Contracting Officer.  The intent is to utilize unique private sector engineering expertise with demonstrated experience in the area of air-delivered armament to enhance the Air Force's capability to accomplish munitions development and acquisition programs.  Interested sources who feel they can meet the requirement should provide a statement of capabilities that provides the following information related to their demonstrated experience and capability in the area of air-delivered armament:  a)  Potential offerors are to have demonstrated successful experience providing air armament engineering services.

Give an example of your ability to recruit top quality engineering personnel in air armament engineering disciplines.  d)  Technical leadership:  TEAS 5 contractor personnel will perform tasks defined by Government engineers, but TEAS personnel are supervised by TEAS contractor task order managers.  Since the TEAS 5 contract will be a task order contract, AAC is looking for contractors with demonstrated technical leadership in air armament to select, assign, train, manage, and support its employees.  Describe your experience in managing task order engineering work that is prescribed by Government engineers.  Indicate your experience with integrating with Government engineers, while maintaining your ability to select, assign, train, manage, and support your employees.  e)  Systems Engineering Presence:  AAC is extremely diverse in geographic location, in mission requirements, and in application of technical capabilities.  The TEAS contractor must provide a systems engineering presence across AAC to ensure that best practices and lessons learned from any part of the center are available for application across the center.  The TEAS contractor must have the capability to recognize “cross-cutting” issues and must provide a structure to facilitate exchange of technical information across the organizations served by the contract.  Describe your systems engineering experience in the area of air-delivered armament systems.  Give an example of how you migrated a lessons learned and/or best practice for one organization or engineering problem to another organization or engineering problem.  f) Community Presence:  The TEAS contractor must have demonstrated an intentional and deliberate process to encourage and reward technical excellence and professionalism in its engineering workforce.  Describe briefly your current company policy to encourage the growth of technical excellence and professionalism in your engineering workforce.  Statement of capability packages shall be submitted by email attachment to Ms. Dee Stone, doris.stone@eglin.af.mil, Mr. Carl Ledford, oben.ledford@eglin.af.mil, hand carried, or mailed to AAC/ENR, Attn: Mr. Carl Ledford, Building 11, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 160, Eglin FL 32542.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI. The DoD Power Sources Technology Working Group (PSTWG) and the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) working through the Next-Generation Manufacturing Technology (NGMTI) Program, is soliciting expressions of interest from U.S. industry, academic organizations, and other government agencies regarding the creation of a Strategic Investment Plan for Power Source Systems.  The topic encompasses power source technologies including batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, hybrid systems, and other potential solutions to meet the challenges of providing power for military uses including communication electronics, aviation, weapons, space, vehicular power, and special applications.  An initial 2-day strategic planning workshop is scheduled for February 28 to March 2, 2006 in Knoxville, TN.  This workshop will develop the general content of the Power Source Systems Strategic Investment Plan and establish a foundation for further planning for potential R&D projects.   Due to space constraints and the need to ensure a balance of industry and government perspectives, participation in the workshop is by invitation only.  If you are interested in attending this workshop, please complete the short information questionnaire posted below, and return it together with your firm’s qualifications via email by 15 February2006, to Anthony Hawkins at LOGR&D@navy.mil.   The questionnaire covers topics such as: 1) Is your company or organization currently researching, developing or producing power sources for a DoD system or program?  If so, please identify and briefly describe your program(s); 2) In your opinion, what technical issues present the greatest barrier to providing electrical power to current and future warfighter equipment?; 3) What technical topics might benefit most from creation of a strategic plan to guide collaborative, industry/government research and development of power source technologies?; 4) What new or future power source technologies should the DoD pursue beyond batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and hybrid systems?;  and 5) What technical area(s) do you represent?  Responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government  use only.  However, the DoD PSTWG’s and the JDMTP’s intent is to develop a broadly shared strategic plan from the aggregate of the information provided from industry as a whole, and it is desired that all responses be nonproprietary. All responses must reference RFI no. N0016406R6659  Points of Contact (POCs) for this RFI are as follows: Tony Hawkins

Background  NASA has traditionally engaged the commercial sector by procuring products and services through contracts. Additionally, there are commercialization and partnership initiatives that utilize less traditional mechanisms like prizes, license agreements, and space act agreements.  However, despite the existing involvement of the private sector to help NASA achieve its vision and mission, three management challenges remain: •	To attract and motivate private sector innovators and investors who have not typically conducted business with NASA, including tapping more efficiently into the pool of small, leading-edge, organizations which are responsible for much of the innovative hi-tech thinking and research in the US; •	To leverage existing external venture capital to encourage development of technologies and products likely to be of future use to NASA’s mission;   •	To improve and expedite public/private partnership formation, through the redesign of administrative, management, and legal processes and procedures. Several federal agencies have already established programs that address these challenges through venture funds.	For example, the CIA and Army/SoCom respectively created the In-Q-Tel and OnPoint Funds. In order for NASA to specifically focus on entrepreneurial innovation in support of its mission objectives, the Agency has laid the foundation for a private equity investment vehicle (working name “Red Planet Capital”) aimed at early-stage companies.  2. Description  Red Planet Capital (the “Fund”) will be an investment vehicle used to support innovative, dual-use technologies which will help NASA achieve its mission, but will also help better position these technologies for future commercial use.	Portfolio companies should not anticipate the government as the primary customer.  However, NASA anticipates that this approach might help some of NASA’s mission directorates in their future “make-versus-buy” decision-making processes.  The Fund will invest in new, promising technologies through equity financing instruments.  It is intended that Red Planet Capital will invest in syndication with existing private sector corporate and/or financial venture funds and abide by the same validation, due diligence, valuation and investment decision and management processes and principles.  Anticipated activities include: sourcing and generating deal flow; reviewing and appraising business plans; performing detailed business analysis and developing the investment case.  More specifically, the Fund will need to negotiate deal structure, conduct relevant management, financial, and technical due diligence, form co-investment syndicates; develop and finalize the investment structure, including price; and work with the NASA Interface Center.   The Fund’s official Agency interface organization (the NASA Interface Center) will be representing both Mission Directorates and business support functions. The NASA Interface Center will be the Agency’s main regular communication mechanism with Red Planet Capital and will help strategically guide and focus the Fund on specific areas of immediate and longer term interest.  The NASA Interface Center will also perform technical assessments of Fund proposed investments.  The NASA Interface Center has identified initial problem sets which focus on: 	Innovative Human Enhancements for Exploration Water Recycling, Reuse, and Reduction In Situ Fabrication of Replacement Parts Technology Environmental Monitoring, Control, and Revitalization Communications and Data Systems Biomedical Support for Exploration Missions Legally, organizationally and operationally NASA has adapted the In-Q-Tel template to create its new fund which is scheduled to begin initial operation in Fiscal Year 2006.  Although NASA will provide strategic direction and input on technical validity and relevance, investment decisions will be made by the Fund, not by NASA.	Investment and operational funds available in Fiscal Year 2006 total $11M.  It is anticipated Fund size will grow to approximately $20M per year. It is anticipated that the proceeds from the Fund will eventually be re-invested in the Fund for continuing investment activities. Red Planet Capital complements other investment instruments already available inside the Agency for promoting private sector participation in the Agency’s mission and vision. It is important to note that Red Planet Capital is not designed to replace existing technology partnership and technology transfer programs but rather on being another innovative mechanism for promoting the future availability of broad-use technologies that meet NASA mission requirements.  3. Process  The Innovative Partnerships Program oversees this program.  In Fiscal Year 2006, NASA plans to identify suitable partners for the venture capital initiative, negotiate a funded Space Act Agreement with the selected partner, deliver a set of NASA mission problem sets to the investment fund through the NASA Interface Center, and review initial investment decisions of the Fund.							  Step 1: Solicit information through this RFI on Fund structure and management, and identify parties qualified and interested in partnering with NASA on the venture capital investment initiative. Step 2: Negotiate a Funded Space Act Agreement with the partner selected per the evaluation criteria in this RFI.  The Space Act Agreement will provide for both investment and management funds. 4. Information for Respondents  4.1 How to Respond  Respondents are requested to provide a description of a proposed funded partnership with NASA for the establishment and operation of a venture capital fund. Responses shall describe: (1) the respondent’s team and expertise, key personnel and experience, proposed geographic location of Fund activities; (2) respondent’s proposed Fund organizational structure and management approach; (3) respondent’s investment strategy for the Fund; (4) respondent’s compensation plan for Fund employees; and (5) respondent’s approach to maximize programmatic value to NASA.  Respondents are limited to organizations in which the majority ownership or control is by U.S. citizens. Based on respondents’ description of these five (5) factors, NASA will evaluate how effective and efficient the proposed Fund will be in meeting the objectives and programmatic goals in this RFI. Responses must be a maximum of seven (7) pages, with minimum 12-point Times font. All proposals shall include the organization name, point-of-contact, address, and phone number.  All proposals shall include an e-mail address for the point-of-contact in order to expedite communications. All questions posed by email shall get a response.  Please submit all responses in electronic format to the Point-of-Contact listed below by 8:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time, February 28, 2006:  Name: Lisa Lockyer	   Title: Deputy Director (Acting), Innovative Partnerships Program   Phone: 202-358-5227   Email: Lisa.L.Lockyer @nasa.gov  Questions regarding this RFI should also be addressed to the above Point-of-Contact.  Based upon assessment of the responses, NASA may contact RFI respondents to gain more information on specific points.  Respondents are reminded that the evaluation process does not involve the procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) nor the NASA FAR supplement since this announcement will not result in the award of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement.   4.2 General Information  4.2.1 Proprietary or Confidential Information  Respondents are NOT to provide any information that is considered proprietary, trade secrets, or privileged or confidential.  4.2.2 Intellectual Property  NASA does not anticipate any government rights in portfolio company intellectual property.   4.2.3 Compliance with U.S. Laws, Regulations, and Policies  Proposals must comply with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations and policies.  4.2.4 Use of Government Resources  In support of this RFI, the Government will consider requests from respondents for Government furnished equipment, facilities or services.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All information received will be for planning purposes only. The CECOM Acquisition Center does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherw ise pay for any information presented. All proprietary information should be marked as such. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit comments on version 1.5 of the DCGS-A Interface Specifications.  To obtain the DCGS-A Interface Specifications version 1.5 on CD as well as comments received on previous versions, please contact Mr. Ron Schaefer, ron.s chaefer@us.army.mil, 732 427 5174, PM DCGS-A, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703. The DCGS-A architecture will be Net-Centric, service-oriented, platform-independent, and driven by well-defined interface specifications between information providers and consumers within the DCGS-A enterprise at all operational levels. In this case a ser vice is an abstraction of a set of network-accessible operations and associated resources (e.g., data, business logic); services are described using open industry Web Services standards such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and XML Schema Defin ition (XSD). The services are published to a service registry, discovered by service consumers, and invoked by service consumers. Interface Specifications help DCGS-A achieve interoperability with joint and national systems, and also provide the basic buil ding blocks for organizing the implementation of capabilities into service-oriented, loosely-coupled components and associated work packages. The Interface Specifications described in this package are: " The foundation for a DCGS-A Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); " Platform-independent, meaning they are not hard-wired to any specific software or hardware platforms, technologies, or vendors; " Utilize open Web Services standards, such as WSDL, XML, and XSD, managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), OASIS; and " Modular and Loosely Coupled, which breaks down the stovepipes across legacy systems and provides overall system agility, adaptability, and survivability. These draft interface specifications are the property of the Government. The interface specifications are draft. Comments and suggested modifications to these draft interface specifications are welcome, but all modifications will remain Government owned. Your feedback is important in driving the evolutionary path of the interface specifications and making them more robust, more precise, and more comprehensive.

The Government intends to establish a new contract for the supply of a Solid State Radar (SSR) Manual Test Console (MTC), part number 47E527300, in support of the 526th Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System Wing (526th ICBMSW) Flight Systems Sustainment Group (FSSG). The MTC will be purchased and utilized as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for the SSR Repair Program. This requirement will be to update the drawings/documentation and provide a new MTC. The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. 
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for repair services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.     Lockheed Martin has currently been identified as the only qualified source. 

Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services, should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements; 2) employees with satisfactory qualifications; and 3) material and equipment to appropriately build the MTC to be able to conduct a procurement for this required supply without technical, schedule or cost risk to the 526th ICBMSW/FSSG prior to contract award.
A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be normally considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

All visitors must be US Citizens.  Visitors are to bring hardhats and must wear steel-toe shoes.  
We will meet by the guard shack in the parking lot adjacent to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s fenced compound on Kirtland AFB at 0830 on Thursday 26 January 2006.  All visitors are to enter through Kirtland AFB’ Gibson gate.  After entering the Gibson gate, continue on Gibson past Pennsylvania, then turn right on Texas Street.  After passing avenues F, G, and H, the DTRA compound will be on your left.  Turn left into the parking lot and find LCDR Phillips who will be waiting outside the guard shack.  We will wait no more than 5 minutes before beginning the site visit so please ensure you arrive on time.  If you have extenuating circumstances that may cause a delay, please notify LCDR Phillips on his cell phone at 505 730 0425 so we don’t leave without you.
All contractors who wish to participate in this site visit must notify LCDR Phillips no later than Friday 20 January 2006 by email (homer.phillips@abq.dtra.mil) to provide him with the full name of each visitor.  LCDR Phillips will create a consolidated list of visitors.

At the Gibson gate, the driver must notify the gate guard that you are attending DTRA’s A&E Contract Site Visit and that his and his passenger’s names should all be on the guard’s list. Everyone in the vehicle will have to produce a valid ID such as a driver’s license or government ID.  Sam’s cards or credit cards are not acceptable.  In addition, the driver must produce for the guard proof of current insurance and vehicle registration.  Please have it ready as you approach the gate to avoid delays.  
For access to White Sands Missile Range, the second phase of the site visit, DTRA requires additional information for security passes.  Each contractor’s security manager must submit a Visitor’s Request to DTRA’s Security Specialist, SSGT Tina Fahlsing (505-846-8782 tina.fahlsing@abq.dtra.mil) and provide the following information:

<SUBJECT>20 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - FABRICATION & INSTALLATION - AID TO NAVIGATION PLATFORM - MARINE ENVIRONMENT
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), (collectively the “Government”), intends to procure fabrication and installation services of a lighted aid to navigation/science platform.  This is a 100% HubZone set-aside.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine whether there is a competitive market for a HubZone set-aside.  The NAICS code is 423830.

The FKNMS is charged, in conjunction with the Florida Department of Environmental Development, with protecting the marine resources of the Florida Keys from Biscayne Bay through Dry Tortugas National Park.  One of the most devastating causes of injury to the reefs in the Florida Keys are vessel groundings, many of which are the result of insufficient lighted aids to navigation in the area. Although Looe Key has numerous moorings and boundary buoys marking these zones, it is marked by only one true aid to navigation; a 10’ lighted marker (designated as Red “24”) on the southeast corner of the reef.   There are no other lighted aids within 4 nautical miles of Looe Key “24”.  The main goal of this project is to establish a lighted aid to navigation on the southwest corner of Looe Key to provide further protection from these vessel groundings.  Another important function of this platform will be to mount instruments for scientific research and public outreach programs known as the Telepresence Project.  The water depth is approximately 26’ at the intended installation site.  

This RFI is intended to identify qualified HubZone contractors interested in providing the product and services identified herein.  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, material handling for delivery to the offshore site, tools, testing devices, security, accountability, submittals, supervision, equipment, each and every item of expense necessary for transport, supply, fabrication, erection, and installation of the lighted aid to navigation.  This generally includes, but is not limited to, the fabrication of the platform per the drawings and specifications to be provided by the Government, installation of the pile in the marine environment, and offshore fabrication to permanently affix the platform to the pile.  The contractor will be required to comply with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, the FKNMS regulations (15 CFR 922) and any permit conditions listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Private Aide To Navigation Permit, the Army Corps of Engineers Permit, and the FKNMS Manager’s permit.  NOAA will obtain the necessary Federal permits for this project.  The contractor shall be responsible for incorporating any permit requirements provided by the Government into the operations.

HubZone organizations possessing the qualifications to perform the duties mentioned herein, are encouraged to submit the following information to the recipient as shown below:  a copy of the Small Business Administration’s HubZone Certification document; explanation of organizational structure; description of the company’s qualifications that meet the requirements of this RFI; detailed description of completed or in-process projects during the last 3 years that were similar in nature to the project identified in this RFI (identify the role played by the HubZone company, location of the project. Project description, and dollar value.); and provide 3 past performance references for whom services have been performed within the last 6 years (information must include the name and address of the organization for whom services were performed, contact person information,  phone number, project name, project description, dollar value, and the date of performance).

Responses are due no later than 2:00 PM CST, February 21, 2006.  Submit 1 electronic and 1 hardcopy of response to:  Mailing Address - USDOC/NOAA/CRAD, 601 E. 12th Street, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106, Attention:  Jane A. Allen (Phone 816-426-7531); Email Address jane.a.allen@noaa.gov; or Facsimile Number 816-274-6993.  Telephone responses are not acceptable.

It is important that all responses submitted specify on the cover page of the response or in the transmittal letter submitted with the response, RFI Number NCND6012500020JAA. This  RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotes (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this notice will not be returned. In submitting a response, you are solely responsible and accountable for all of the expenses associated with your response.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541430.  The applicable size standard is $6M.  Commerce Business Daily Note 1 applies to this requirement.  The requirement is to apply high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight Air Force buses in accordance with the following Statement of Work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  Scope:  The 12th Mission Support Group Vehicle Management Flight (12 MSG/LGRV) requires application of a shrink-wrap style vinyl graphic to four sides of eight buses used by their distinguished visitor support section.  These buses are driven throughout the San Antonio area and are ridden by the highest-level executives in the Air Force and other DoD components and must meet the highest quality standards in terms of appearance and durability.

2.  Objective:  The overall objective of this requirement is to install high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight buses designated by the 12 MSG/LGRV.

3.  Description of Work:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, transportation, equipment, tools, labor, supplies, materials, and supervision necessary to produce and install the vinyl wrap for each bus, unless otherwise stipulated.  The contractor is required to perform the required work on-site in a facility mutually agreed upon by the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV and the contractor is responsible for cleaning the work area daily.  The contractor will produce vinyl graphics, from designs supplied electronically by 12 MSG/LGRV, and apply them to the front, rear, left-hand, and right-hand side of each bus described in the listing of buses to wrap.  One exception is bus 04B2278.  This bus already has vinyl wrap applied.  It only requires application of the Randolph design, described below, to the right-hand side.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining the precise measurements of each vehicle to be covered, prior to production and installation of the vinyl wrap.  The front, rear, and left-hand side graphic are described as the “Recruiting design,” and the right-hand side graphic is described as the “Randolph design.”  The contractor is responsible for preparation of the vehicular surfaces prior to application of the vinyl wrap.  The designs will be applied, conforming to the contours of the vehicular body, covering each entire side and in the event of sectional overlap of the design panels, the graphic will match at the intersection of subject seams.  The panel(s) will extend the entire width of each body side with a minimum of 18-inch overlap onto the roof section of the vehicle(s).  The contractor will trim and fit the panels according to the window and door moldings, corrugated body panels, etc., to ensure all doors, windows, existing body panels, etc., are fully functional upon completion of the work.  Sections of the panels that cover windows or glass portions of the vehicle will be of the type that allow one-way viewing from the inside to the outside of the passenger carrying compartment.  The only exception to glass coverage is the windshield; it will not have any vinyl coverage.  Additionally, the contractor will remove exterior lighting assemblies, door handles, locks, cameras, etc. to properly install the vinyl wrap and reinstall the same prior to completion of the work.  All components removed and reinstalled by the contractor to facilitate installation of the vinyl wrap will be fully functional.  The contractor will apply the Recruiting design to the front, rear, and left-hand side of each bus and the Randolph design to the right-hand side of each bus.  The contractor will re-size the overall graphic to conform proportionally to the varying size of each vehicle.  Prior to production and application of the vinyl panels, the contractor will provide 12 MSG/LGRV digital imagery of re-sized graphics on a representative image of the subject vehicle for final approval.  The specific sequence of wrapping the subject buses is limited to availability from daily operations and will be coordinated/scheduled jointly between the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV.  Completion of the described work should be accomplished no later than 1 April 2006.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office intends to issue an order to B&L Associates for other than full and open competition. The order issued will provide for licensing and software support of the BL/LIB, BL/LIB ROBO and BL/DIST software products for 2006.  This non-competitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 6.301.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The PTO has been using the BL/LIB and BL/LIB ROBO products since 1996 and the BL/DIST product since 1991.  As is common for software products that run on the Unisys platform, only one company is in the business of supporting this proprietary software.  That company is the creator of these products, B&L Associates.  Therefore, this order can only be placed with one source:  B&L Associates.  A recompetition of the product and support at this time would add unnecessary expense and time delay to the USPTO.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541430.  The applicable size standard is $6M.  Commerce Business Daily Note 1 applies to this requirement.  The requirement is to apply high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight Air Force buses in accordance with the following Statement of Work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  Scope:  The 12th Mission Support Group Vehicle Management Flight (12 MSG/LGRV) requires application of a shrink-wrap style vinyl graphic to four sides of eight buses used by their distinguished visitor support section.  These buses are driven throughout the San Antonio area and are ridden by the highest-level executives in the Air Force and other DoD components and must meet the highest quality standards in terms of appearance and durability.

2.  Objective:  The overall objective of this requirement is to install high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight buses designated by the 12 MSG/LGRV.

3.  Description of Work:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, transportation, equipment, tools, labor, supplies, materials, and supervision necessary to produce and install the vinyl wrap for each bus, unless otherwise stipulated.  The contractor is required to perform the required work on-site in a facility mutually agreed upon by the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV and the contractor is responsible for cleaning the work area daily.  The contractor will produce vinyl graphics, from designs supplied electronically by 12 MSG/LGRV, and apply them to the front, rear, left-hand, and right-hand side of each bus described in the listing of buses to wrap.  One exception is bus 04B2278.  This bus already has vinyl wrap applied.  It only requires application of the Randolph design, described below, to the right-hand side.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining the precise measurements of each vehicle to be covered, prior to production and installation of the vinyl wrap.  The front, rear, and left-hand side graphic are described as the “Recruiting design,” and the right-hand side graphic is described as the “Randolph design.”  The contractor is responsible for preparation of the vehicular surfaces prior to application of the vinyl wrap.  The designs will be applied, conforming to the contours of the vehicular body, covering each entire side and in the event of sectional overlap of the design panels, the graphic will match at the intersection of subject seams.  The panel(s) will extend the entire width of each body side with a minimum of 18-inch overlap onto the roof section of the vehicle(s).  The contractor will trim and fit the panels according to the window and door moldings, corrugated body panels, etc., to ensure all doors, windows, existing body panels, etc., are fully functional upon completion of the work.  Sections of the panels that cover windows or glass portions of the vehicle will be of the type that allow one-way viewing from the inside to the outside of the passenger carrying compartment.  The only exception to glass coverage is the windshield; it will not have any vinyl coverage.  Additionally, the contractor will remove exterior lighting assemblies, door handles, locks, cameras, etc. to properly install the vinyl wrap and reinstall the same prior to completion of the work.  All components removed and reinstalled by the contractor to facilitate installation of the vinyl wrap will be fully functional.  The contractor will apply the Recruiting design to the front, rear, and left-hand side of each bus and the Randolph design to the right-hand side of each bus.  The contractor will re-size the overall graphic to conform proportionally to the varying size of each vehicle.  Prior to production and application of the vinyl panels, the contractor will provide 12 MSG/LGRV digital imagery of re-sized graphics on a representative image of the subject vehicle for final approval.  The specific sequence of wrapping the subject buses is limited to availability from daily operations and will be coordinated/scheduled jointly between the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV.  Completion of the described work should be accomplished no later than 1 April 2006.

HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 30) CLAUSES:

3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]
 (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of clause)

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW Room 2606 Washington D. C. 20593 Telephone: (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011
