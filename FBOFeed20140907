<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HHSNCCOPCCSS14-016576 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).The NAICS Code for this solicitationis 334118 small Business Size Standard 1,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisitions Circular 2005-74 dated July 1, 2014. The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation Supplement (HHSAR) can be accessed via the Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm (FAR) and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfhhsara.htm (HHSAR). This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by this agency. <br />Background <br />The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.</p>
<p>The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&amp;IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes. Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures). Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&amp;IS's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS). The findings are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&amp;IS's Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Center's Hospital Information System (CRIS).</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>This request is for the purchase two EIZO 6MP color monitor in order to replace four older monitors used in one of the radiology reading rooms. The older monitors were purchased in 2004. One 30" EIZO monitor can replace two of the older Totoku monitors as the EIZO's have dual screen capabilities. The new monitors will be use by the departmental radiologists to read diagnostic images.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition procedures, and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items.
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-14-715 and the solicitation is issued as a pre-solicitation notice of intent to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to:</p>
<p>Asedasciences Inc<br />1281 Win Hentschel Blvd <br />West Lafayette, IN, 47906-4182</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION DETERMINATION</strong><br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted.</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), only one source, Asedasciences Inc., has been determined to be the only source capable of providing this commercial service.<br />&nbsp;<br />AsedaSciences' unique services measure the simultaneous effect of compounds / drugs on multiple parameters on human cells. AsedaSciences then performs automated analysis using a proprietary algorithm on the biological fingerprints generated by the data to allow comparison of new compounds provided by clients to those housed in Asedasciences' database. This process is fully automated and allows AsedaSciences to cluster compounds based on their similarity of effect on the cells and parameters that are measured. AsedaSciences, like no other organization, will in effect, be able to cluster and compare compounds based on their specific characteristics and disease area to enable clients to determine degree or cause of potential toxicity based on the parameters measured or potentially mechanism of action depending on the class of compounds that are chosen for clustering.</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is not a small business set-aside. Therefore, any responsible source may submit a quote.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Therefore, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number M67400-14-T-0255 applies and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-76 and Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement Publication Number (DPN) 20140805.

This volume shall also contain the quoter's Safety Plan, in accordance with the SOW, and proof of current Compressor Gas Association certification.</p>
<p>(i) Technical Proposal shall be practical, legible, clear, and coherent.
