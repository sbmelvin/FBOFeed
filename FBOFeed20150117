This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>This Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity is prepared to meet the statutory requirements of FAR 16.505(b)(2), exception to the fair opportunity process. According to FAR 16.505.(b)(2)(i), the Contracting Officer shall give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless one of the exceptions listed in the section applies. In the case of subject procurement, the exception listed under FAR 16.505.(b)(2)(i)(A), "The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays" applies.<br /><br />The Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan&nbsp;faces an urgent need to generate sustainable sources of revenue. While several very large and potentially valuable mineral deposits have been identified in Afghanistan, GIRoA now realizes that such projects will take ten years or longer to start generating significant revenue. The Mission, therefore, recognizes the need to conduct core drilling activities that will enable Mining Investment and&nbsp;Development for Afghan Sustainability (MIDAS) to immediately support Afghanistan's efforts to generate revenue from the three&nbsp;high-value mineral deposits.
<p>MIDAS and AGS must obtain some core samples from the most accessible (and least complicated as regards start-up of mining operations) of the high-value deposit sites before the snow season makes drilling impossible. Once core samples are obtained andanalyzed, Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (MoMP) will be able to prepare the tenders needed for private sector mining companies to bid on extraction of tantalum, and possibly granite. If the samples are made available and analyzed, bids could be received and evaluated by the 2nd Quarter of 2015 and mining operations could start to generate revenue late in 2015 or early 2016.</p>
