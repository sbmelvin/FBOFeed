<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:
Present methods for monitoring exposures use either stationary or personal samplers to measure the concentration of substances in the air.   This monitoring fails to account for exposures by routes other than inhalation (for example, ingestion or through the skin).   Furthermore, existing methods provide information only on exposure, and do not measure the amount of compound that may have entered the body.  Lastly, current methods for determining actual intake of chemicals use urine or blood samples which must be analyzed in a laboratory.  This process requires considerable time (often several weeks) before final results can be known.  Researchers at PNNL have developed a system to correct these problems and improve overall sensitivity. This system, called the Exposure-to-Risk Monitor (E2RM), allows real time measurement of the amount and type of chemical a person was exposed to and how much of the chemical remains in the body.  The E2RM combines a breath inlet device, an ion trap mass spectrometer and software.  For most volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), the experimental detection limit is approximately 10 ppb.  Once the concentration of the VOC and its metabolite is known, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic software model is used to relate exposure levels to the amount of internal dose received.  While other monitoring systems usually measure exposure to chemicals in air, the E2RM can determine actual dose from ingestion and skin absorption, as well as inhalation.  The ion trap mass spectrometer can simultaneously track and identify multiple chemicals in the body.  The E2RM system provides nearly immediate readout of the personal samples as soon as the exposure occurs.  The system scans through the mass range for more than 150 VOCs every 1.5 seconds, and can rapidly analyze the decay in concentration for several VOCs in the breath simultaneously.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-02-07-IFKA
<CONTACT>Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2308, Fax (315) 330-7790, Email Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil
<DESC>POINTS OF CONTACT:  Program Manager: James R. Milligan, 315-330-3013, e-mail: james.milligan@rl.af.mil; Technical Advisor: Craig S. Anken, 315-330-4833, e-mail: craig.anken@rl.af.mil; Contracting Officer: Joetta A. Bernhard, 315-330-2308, e-mail: joetta.bernhard@rl.af.mil.  The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/IF) is soliciting white papers for innovative solutions pertaining to the research, development, and transition of technology that will enable mission critical systems to meet the high assurance, dependability, and adaptability requirements of the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD).  The Dynamic Assembly for Systems Adaptability, Dependability, and Assurance (DASADA) Program, sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), began in FY00, and is a four (4) year initiative to address current deficiencies in the composition of software-intensive systems. DASADA technology is aimed to enable architecture refinement with guarantees that critical system properties will be assured through design rules that guide the selection, adaptation, and dynamic run-time assembly of appropriate system components.  The DASADA Program consists of two (2) main phases:  Phase I: Technology Development Projects (TDPs) that resulted from contract awards made under DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 00-20, and
Phase II: Experimental Demonstration Projects (EDPs) led and performed by service organizations and their contractors.
The intent of this Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) is to support Phase II of the (DASADA) Program. EDPs are intended to collaborate with DASADA Phase I TDPs, experiment with their products, further integrate these technologies, and scale them for application on realistic, medium to large DoD systems. 
DASADA Phase II EDPs involve the conduct of experiments to evaluate and demonstrate the value of DASADA technologies in their utility to solve mission critical problems (i.e., those experienced by major military programs and/or systems/subsystems) that arise from deficiencies in our ability to compose and reassemble computer-based systems from new and existing components.  These deficiencies stem largely from the fact that information and other software system architectures have become much more complex, where developers are moving from building monolithic and client/server applications to building n-tier, peer-to-peer, web-service, and application-service architectures, many of which take advantage of the World Wide Web.  Software executing on distributed systems represents a unique synthesis of application code and code for managing requirements such as heterogeneity, scalability, security, and availability.  In addition, the increasing pace required to evolve embedded software systems to fit new environments and contexts requires high-level design models from which adaptive, high confidence system implementations can be verifiably generated.  Under these new circumstances, developers are faced with an increased challenge to deliver systems that need to be more scalable, robust and amenable to change than ever before. DASADA attempts to address this challenge through an architecture-driven approach based largely on the following:  -Components that, in the object-oriented world are built from objects, and are used to build applications. Although components are often associated with those from object technologies such as Microsoft's Common Object Model (COM), Sun's Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), or the Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), components can also be whole applications, and may include legacy components that are not object-oriented at all.  -Probes that interact with the executing system and its environment to collect data.  -Gauges that convert probe data into measures that are meaningful for system tuning.  -Adaptation Mechanisms that perform dynamic system assembly/re-assembly based on the need for change as derived from a comparative analysis between the system specification and feedback on its actual implementation and operation.  It is envisioned that the resultant contract will include the following activities. (1) Integration and scaling/adaptation of selected DASADA technologies, as appropriate, for effective insertion into or application on a DoD system development/upgrade/operation. (2) Determination, collection, and application of appropriate milestones, metrics, measures, and baseline data for controlled experimental evaluation of the value and effectiveness of the technology.  Measures would likely address usability, scalability, robustness, insertion cost, and impact on developmental, maintenance, and operational improvements in productivity/effort/time, product/service quality/effectiveness, and cost. (3) Establishment of appropriate processes and procedures for collecting the data necessary to measure results and assist programmatic decision-making at key predefined milestones. (4) Reporting on scheduled milestone achievements, lessons learned, and technological/programmatic recommendations. (5) Periodic demonstrations (e.g., on a semi-annual basis) of experiment results.  (6) Active participation in DASADA-related meetings with the intention to provide program status/progress and foster collaboration with technologists and Government personnel in such areas as evaluation criteria, operational requirements, technology improvement needs, lessons learned, insertion costs, experimentation results, etc.  Additional information about the DASADA Program including its current TDP participants, products, technologies, and activities may be obtained from the following web sites:  http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/tech/programs/dasada/, http://www.darpa.mil/ito/research/dasada/,
http://schafercorp-ballston.com/dasada/  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offers are required to submit five (5) copies of a fifteen (15) page or less white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institution.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Reference PRDA #02-07-IFKA, AFRL/IFTD, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505. 
Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of  importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including how the proposed experiment addresses the needs of the target system/organization mission, the approach for the development/integration/enhancement/application of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience -- The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution -- The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness.  White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  The following criteria for proposals submitted by offerors invited will be used to determine whether these proposals are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance:  the following evaluation criteria for proposals will be used: (1) Understanding of the problem -- Clear description of operational problems and development/maintenance costs associated with system. The problems/costs should be quantified to the extent possible. The pervasiveness of the problem (i.e., its occurrence beyond the specific system in question) should be documented, (2) Understanding of the technologies -- Clear description of how a specified mix of DASADA (and other) technologies should ameliorate the problems described in Item 1 above, and a demonstrated understanding of the: (a) Extent to which the technologies are likely to ameliorate the problem, (b) Maturity of the technologies and amount and type of efforts required to make them useable, (c) Efforts required to integrate technologies, (3) Adequacy of planning -- Well-defined tasks and milestones with associated resources. Pre-arranged involvement of key personnel from research or other institutions. Well-defined evaluation criteria and specific measures to be used to assess the criteria, along with descriptions of available baseline data and plans for acquiring needed data, (4) Potential for transition -- Demonstration of sincere interest of the operational service organization or office responsible for the target system/program of the experiment. Involvement (e.g., as reviewers/evaluators) of personnel from other programs with similar problems (e.g., those identified in Item 1, above). Evidence that the problem is of large magnitude and is likely to remain so (e.g., no commercial solution is likely),  (5) Cost - Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA will be used.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  All responsible firms may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Principal funding of this PRDA and the contract awards are anticipated to start in FY02. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months in duration, with dollar amounts ranging between $200K to $5M.  Total funding for the PRDA is anticipated to be $15M.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Joetta A. Bernhard, for information if they contemplate responding.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. 
The work to be performed may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at time of award.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta Bernhard, 315-330-2308.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer or program manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Linda Reed, Deputy Chief, Contracting Division, at 315-330-7748.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.   An informational briefing is not planned. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY02-10 Apr 2002; FY03-10 Apr 2003; FY04-10 Apr 2004.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each fiscal year after the dates cited.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2004.  A copy of the AFRL/IFK publication, "BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry", Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address, and reference PRDA-02-07-IFKA. Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures a firm fixed price award to the American Hospital Association, 840 North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60611.  AHA collects data quarterly on a sample of hospitals with the National Hospital Indicators Survey (NHIS).  AHA will continue to provide data collected in items 1 through 5 of the financial section of the annual survey questionnaire.  The data should be summarized to U.S. totals for all registered hospitals, and should contain information on all non-federal hospitals and all community hospitals.  This data identifies revenues, expenses and details of patient revenue and uncompensated care.  In addition, the contractor will provide data formerly available in the Hospital Statistics publication for each of the 50 states and for the U.S. total: (1) Net Total Not-For-Profit Revenues (was available in the 96/97 Hospital Statistics in Table 6) and (2) Not-For-Profit Expenses (was available in the 96/97 Hospital Statistics in Table 3C). Further, the contractor will provide special tabulations of specific groupings of non-community hospitals for 1980 through 2000, permitting the conversion of hospital expenses to revenues.  These specific categories of non-community hospitals include registered nonfederal, non-community hospitals only and for registered and non-registered nonfederal, non-community hospitals.  The variables to be tabulated are Total Revenue, Total Expenses, Count of Hospitals, and Ratio (generated by Robert Davis? program RATIO86) for the following groupings or Ratio Numbers: Private Hospital; All Other Services; Private Tuberculosis Hospital; Private Institutional Unit; Private Psychiatric Hospital; Private Alcohol Chemical Hospital; State Hospital; All Other Services; State Tuberculosis Hospital; State Institutional Unit; State Psychiatric Hospital, State Alcohol and Chemical Hospital; Local Government Hospital, All Other Services; Local Government Tuberculosis Hospital; and Local Government Psychiatric Hospital. The AHA is the only responsible source for procurement of the data we propose to continue to purchase.  The AHA owns the data and has established data collection and processing systems under the current scope of work to support the analyses required by this contract.  Another contractor would have to establish a new data collection  and processing system that the existing contractor already has in place.  It is estimated that this process would take several years at a cost to CMS in excess of $1,000,000 annually.
This contract is a continuation of four previous 5-year contracts with the American Hospital Association which has supplied the National Hospital Panel Survey , the National Hospital Indicators Survey and the Annual Survey of Hospitals since September 26, 1980.  CMS has supported both intramural and extramural research since that time using these data, which have become an integral part of several large CMS data bases, including our national baseline for marking the levels and inflation rates of total health care spending and its components.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>1.1 INTRODUCTION

Space and Missile Center (SMC), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) announce a Space Based Radar On-Board Processing (OBP) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as supplemented and applicable to Program Research and Development Agreement (PRDA) soliciting research proposals from private industry, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research.

 The purpose of this PRDA is to design and demonstrate a prototype OBP Architecture that can meet the tactical user near real time needs of Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).  The OBP development must be affordable and capable of being transitional to the evolving SBR baseline with a planned Initial Launch Capability (ILC) in 2010.  Proposed technology development must be demonstrated in 2004 or 2005 at TRL-5 as a minimum.

 The period of performance for proposals awarded in response to this PRDA is for FY02.  Proposals shall contain a brief summary of the work from concept development through demonstration and a ceiling rough order of magnitude (CROM) price spread by Government Fiscal Year (1 Oct-30 Sep).  It is expected that an effort that spans Fiscal Years will be incrementally funded.  Based upon funding and other criterion, the Government intends to award multiple contracts.  It is also the Government's intentions to restrict the total value of any single contract awarded as a result of this PRDA to a maximum price of $1M/FY02.  Funding in later years will depend on the demonstration plan(s) that are selected.  As part of the response Offerors are encouraged to propose an OBP risk reduction technology roadmap within the allotted funding described herein.  Offerors are cautioned that award of any contract(s) pursuant to this PRDA is subject to the availability of funds.
1.2 PRDA ELIGIBILITY

This PRDA is open only to organizations located in the United States.  Proposals from foreign owned or controlled organizations will be considered if properly certified by the DoD to bid on U.S. DoD programs.  This is an unrestricted solicitation. The government reserves the right to reserve the contract(s) to small business if they can satisfactorily demonstrate the requisite capability.

For more information regarding OBP and this PRDA, please visit our site at http://www.losangeles.af.mil, then click on "SMC Organizations," then "XR," then "Projects," then "SBR."

To be eligible for award of a contract under this PRDA, a prospective offeror must have demonstrated experience with relevant basic an/or applied research areas, and/or knowledge of overhead reconnaissance systems.  Furthermore, the offeror must meet minimum responsibility standards as set forth in FAR 9.104-1.

1.4 BAA/PRDA SCHEDULE

12 February 2002 (PRDA Announcement released), 15 March 2002 (Final day to submit proposals), 12 April 2002	(Proposals to evaluations complete), 30 April 2002 (Contracts awarded)

2.0 TECHNICAL AREAS

The SBR OBP Program is most interested in investigating on-board processing technologies applicable to the SBR Program.

	The SBR OBP Program is also interested in developing radar signal processing algorithms, associated technologies and system concepts and architectures that encompass OBP and will meet the SBR mission objectives.

2.1 DISCUSSIONS
	
General requirements for SBR are as follows:
- Mission: Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), in priority order.
- Theater tasking
- Robust Theater downlink compatible with 2010 theater communication capabilities of SAR and GMTI data with sufficient resolution and timeliness to perform the SBR mission.

The OBP shall accept data from the payload beamformer in the form of multiple wideband radar (i.e., unprocessed) channels pre-sub-band combination as leveraged off existing and future payload technology developments.  The OBP will combine the sub-bands and create either GMTI detections or SAR image data.  The SAR data may be either complex imagery data or detected imagery data.  The SAR data will be downlinked to theater assets typical of the 2010 timeframe.  The capacity of the OBP and associated buffers will assure timely delivery of the products with no loss of collected radar data.  Front-end collection data rates will be commensurate with high resolution, multi-channel SAR, GMTI, and DTED operation for up to 25 minutes (TBR) at a time.  OBP shall support SBR performance requirements (e.g. area rates, search modes, latency, probability of detection, false alarm density, etc.) as described in the Electronic Scanning Array (ESA) Technical Requirements Document (TRD), (March 28, 2001).  Offerors must possess at a minimum a SECRET security clearance level in order to obtain a copy of the TRD.  To obtain a copy of the TRD, call the SBR Program Office, Lt Ryan Space at (310) 363-2636.  Security Clearance must be verified.

Proposals to the PRDA shall identify key interface parameters such as data rate, power requirements, word length, speed, storage capacity, buffer requirements, number of ports (channels), redundancy, interchangeability, etc.  Processor and Mass Data Storage (MDS) size, weight, power, cost and radiation tolerance are key parameters and will be factors in determining contract award(s).  Output data shall be compressed for communications downlink capability.  Output data and communications interface capability and parameters shall be proposed.  Note that the MDS and downlink capabilities shall also support raw wideband data downlink to CONUS.  All OBP algorithms shall be documented as well as all OBP features that would allow on-orbit algorithm modification.

	For the purpose of this PRDA, the Government considers the OBP to include MDS, Back End Processor (BEP) and interface elements (at the beamformer/pulse compression interface).   The BEP shall provide algorithm capability for sub-band combining to create either GMTI detections or SAR image data.  OBP system proposed concepts that incorporate a complete FEP (distinct from current payload designs and including A/D, channelizers and beamformer) with a BEP shall provide justification as to how this enhances performance, cost parameters, and the SBR mission.  Output data shall be compressed for communications downlink capability, if appropriate.  Output data and communications interface capability and parameters shall be proposed.  Note that the MDS and downlink capabilities shall also support raw data (post-FEP) downlink to CONUS.

3.0 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

Offerors interested in submitting a proposal are cautioned that only a Government Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.
3.1 PRDA VALIDITY PERIOD

4.0 PROPOSAL EVALUATION

4.1 CRITERIA
Proposals submitted in response to this BAA/PRDA will be evaluated in the following areas: Technical/Management, Price and Security.

4.1.1 TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT CRITERIA
The following criteria are applied during step 1 of the evaluation (see section 4.2).

(1)	Prior Experience with Radar Processing.  Due to the short timeline involved it is imperative that the principal project personnel, institution, or corporation demonstrate prior experience with radar signal processing and design and fabrication of processors.
(2)	Potential Contributions to SBR.  The applicability and potential impact of the proposed effort to the SBR mission.  The SBR Program is most interested in projects that significantly impact the ability of the SBR to accomplish its warfighter mission and provide dramatic improvement through new mission capabilities that directly solve critical intelligence problems.
(3)	Innovation of the proposed effort.  The degree to which the proposed effort presents a new approach to achieving the SBR goals.  This could involve the clever use of existing technology or where necessary, the development of new technologies.
(4)	Scalability and Adaptability.  The ability of the proposed architecture to incorporate changing SBR requirements.  As throughput requirements and algorithms changes occur, the proposed design should have the flexibility to incorporate these changes.
(5)	Uniqueness of the proposed effort to SBR.  The degree to which the proposed effort is solely, and uniquely applicable to SBR.  Due to funding constraints, the SBR Program is most interested in projects that are unique to the SBR Program with little or no likelihood of development by other Government sources.

The following criteria are applied during step 2 of the evaluation (see section 4.2):

(1)	Technical Approach.  The degree to which the Offerors technical approach demonstrates understanding of the technical challenges, including: 
a.	Description of the OBP objectives, tasks and subtasks.
b.	Interface/interchangeability of the OBP
c.	OBP architecture design concepts that leverage off existing and future technology developments.
d.	Discussion of scientific and engineering practices.
e.	Discussion and understanding of the technical risks.
f.	Implementation of processing algorithms for SAR, GMTI
(2)	Management and Risk Management Approach.  The degree to which the offerors management and project plans demonstrate the ability to effectively and efficiently manage and administer the program to a successful conclusion, including:
a.	Insight into the project's progress and into the issues that will arise during the course of the project,
b.	A project schedule that reflects the key events of the project and depicts a realistic, time-phased plan to achieve the proposal's objective,
c.	A project schedule that reflects key milestones, and technology development, which clearly works to mitigate identified risk areas for SBR OBP,
d.	Clear descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of any teaming organizations describing the offerors approach to providing management direction and oversight to these teaming organizations,
e.	Clear descriptions of the experience and qualifications of key personnel,
f.	Adequate available facilities, equipment and information to achieve the proposal's objectives,
g.	Program risk identification and mitigation approaches.

4.1.2 SECURITY CRITERIA

	Security will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis only.  Failure to pass the security related criteria might be grounds for eliminating a proposal from consideration.  Additionally, the following criteria apply:
(1)	Personnel and Facilities.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel (with appropriate SCI accesses are required), required facilities, AIS and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification.
(2)	Security Management Plan.  Compliance and management commitment (appropriate to the classification of the effort) with the applicable DOD 52200.1-R, NRO Security Manual (NSM) dated June 16, 2000 and/or the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) or NISPOM Supplement, DOD 52220.22-M-Supl, dated February 1995.

4.1.3 Price Criteria
	Price must be broken down into the tasks and subtasks described in the Technical/Management section of the proposal. Failure to do so might be grounds for eliminating a proposal from consideration.  Price of proposal will also be evaluated based on the realism of proposed costs within stated budget constraints.

4.2 EVALUATION PROCEDURE
	It is the policy of the Air Force and NRO to treat all proposals as source selection sensitive information before award and to only disclose the contents for evaluation purposes.  The offeror must indicate on the proposal cover page any limitation to be placed on Disclosure of Information contained on the proposal.

	The selection or non-selection of proposals for contract award shall be unilateral and shall not be subject to offerors' protest or disputes.  By submission of a proposal responding to this PDRA, the offeror accepts these restrictions and consents to a waiver of any right to file a protest or receive a formal debriefing if the offer is not accepted.

	For this PRDA, Price, Technical and Management areas are most important.  The Security area will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The evaluation proves will occur in two steps.

	Step 1:

	Upon receipt of the proposal, an evaluation committee will perform an evaluation, using only the proposal's Executive Summary, to determine the prior experience with radar processing, potential contribution to SBR, the degree of innovativeness and the degree of uniqueness of the proposal to SBR.  Proposals found to have insufficient merit based on this evaluation will be eliminated from further consideration.  The offeror will be notified in writing that the proposal is no longer being considered for funding.  The notification will include general rationale for the non-selection of the proposal.  Offerors are strongly cautioned that the Executive Summary must address prior experience with radar processing potential contributions to SBR, the innovativeness of the proposed effort and the uniqueness of the proposed effort to SBR are required by paragraphs 3.6.2 and 4.1.1 above.  Failure to address all four areas may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from further consideration.

	Step 2

	Proposals that successfully complete step 1 will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth above for step 2 of the evaluation.  Offerors may be contacted during this phase by the Contracting Officer to obtain clarifications regarding their proposals.  The Contracting Officer will make awards and/or conduct negotiations with offerors selected for award.

	In previous PRDA solicitations, there has been insufficient funding to fund all proposals that successfully completed step 1 of the evaluation.  The Government anticipates that this may occur in this solicitation as well, depending upon the number and quality of proposals received.

4.3 STAND-ALONE EVALUATION
	The proposals will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the SBR OBP program objective and other criteria described above, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area or in other areas.

5.0 AWARD
	Program initiation is dependent upon contract award.  Awards(s) will be made to the offeror(s) whose proposal(s) conform(s) to the PRDA solicitation and whose proposal(s) is (are) considered most advantageous to the Government, considering all factors.  The Government reserves the right to make awards in some, all, or none of the research areas in paragraph 2.0 above.  The Government also reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no contract awards, depending on technical quality of proposals, funding availability or limitations, and the ability to negotiate a fair and reasonable price.

6.0 QUESTIONS
	Questions concerning this PRDA should be addressed to the SBR Program Contracting Officer, Email address: David.Block@losangeles.af.mil or telephone (310) 363-3187.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Surveillance Research Program(SRP), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCP) plans to procure the services of the University of Oklahoma College of Public Health, 800 NE 15th Street, Suite 532, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 for the development of a pilot project that establishes an infrastructure for the Inter-Tribal Tumor Registry for the Five Tribes of Oklahoma.  The tribal governments have endorsed the Inter-Tribal Registry and have acknowledged the need for such a endeavor.  The registry is intended as an adjunct to the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, to be established according to its policies and procedures.  Of the tribes known historically as the Five Tribes of Oklahoma [Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muskogee (Creek), and Seminole] account for approximately 75% of the estimated tribal population of Iklahoma. An Institute of Medicine report cites that "four facts are consistently found in studies examining cancer among American Indian populations: 1) cancer is the second leading cause of death; 2) American Indians the lowest 5-year survival rate for all cancers compared with other populations; 3) American Indians have the highest percentage of disseminated and ill-defined cancers; and 4) very little is known about prevention and treatment patterns for cancer in American Indians.  Relevant and appropriate intervention efforts for cancer control rely heavily upon accurate surveillance data and reporting.  Cancer surveillance among American Indians in Oklahoma is less than optimal.  Racial misclassification, availability of appropriate population estimates, and minimal inclusion in national reports are all factors that contribute to challenges in producing accurate cancer surveillance data or American Indians in Oklahoma.  To help optimize the accuracy of cancer surveillance data in regions such as Oklahoma an effort that is broad in compass is necessary.  The University of Oklahoma is centrally located to the Five Tribes.  The University of Oklahoma is the only source known to the NCI researchers that can provide the above servcies based on its resources available through the Native American Prevention Research Center and agreements obtained through various discussions with the Five Tribes.  However, if any interested party believes it too can meet the above, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time on February 22, 2002. If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls or faxes will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 541990, business size standard is $5M.  NOTE: Please be adivsed that due to our temporary relocation from 6120 Executive Blvd., Rm. 634, Rockville, MD 20892, all bids/quotes should be sent to 6116 Executive Blvd., Room 205, Rockville, MD 20892 until further notice.

<CONTACT>Carol M. Bolton Contract Specialist  301-744-6789   and/or Renee M. Brown Contracting Officer 301-744-6653
<DESC>The following is a list of various questions submitted by industry.  No additional question will be allowed after 15 Feb 2002.  The solicitation is expected to be released by 28 Feb 021.  1. Has the technical POC considered the system reliability impact of the "specification" to use dual   XP1800 Athlon type nodes is a 1U configuration with respect to the effect of heat? 	Yes, the impact has been considered. 1U configurations can be designed to run as cool or cooler than 2U. The vendor must provide an appropriately designed configuration. 2. Are the fundamental Partial Differential Equations (PDE's) of the primary application targeted for this  system elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic or mixed driving the requirement for a "High Performance" interconnect? 	The short answer is yes, applications will be solving a variety of pde's including elliptic, parabolic, hyperboli c. 	Applications to be run on this system (including, but not limited to):  Quantum chemistry for crystals and molecules programs (commercial, university, or in-house developed). Quantum and classical molecular dynamics programs (commercial, university, or in-house developed). Commercial examples: CRYSTAL98, GAUSSIAN98 University & Government examples: molecular dynamics applications developed at the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Nebraska. Hydrodynamics codes: eulerian, lagrangian, mixed euler-lagrange, adaptive mesh, smooth particle, etc.(government developed). 3. What is the weight in evaluation criteria for the ISO 9002 certification? Does cost have a greater significance? 	The ISO9002 certification is required for quality assurance in system assembly, integration, and installation. Cost is a factor. 4. Do you have to have a Linux based system? 	Yes. Many of the applications (in particular, the molecular dynamics applications from Naval Research Laboratory and University of Nebraska)have been and continue to be developed on Linux based systems. 5. Does it have to be a cluster system? 	Yes. Many of the applications (in particular, the molecular dynamics applications from Naval Research Laboratory and University of Nebraska)have been and continue to be developed on Beowulf type cluster systems. Some require cluster systems to achieve the desired computational performance levels. 6. Does it have to be a Myrinet configuration? 	Yes. Most of the applications, including quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and material modeling, will not only benefit, but require a high performance interconnect such as Myrinet. The Myrinet configuration as specified is also consistent with the requirement for easy future ex pansion capability to increase the number of nodes. 7. Are you in need of any Sun Microsystems equipment? 	No. We are specifically looking for a Beowulf type cluster system. 8. I was just wondering if this was small biz set aside or if I can participate in the quote?  	The value of this procurement is considered to be below the small purchase threshold. Therefore, it is automatically set-aside for small busines.  9.  Why the IS0 9002 certification? They can certify 9000 with various contractors, HP, Compaq, IBM etc, but they don't know anyone in the industry that will certify the integration of the system causing the ISO to go from 9000 to ISO 9002. 	The ISO9002 certification is required for quality assurance in system assembly, integration, and installation. The vendor providing this system must maintain an ISO 9002 certification. 10.  The description sta tes a 45U. Please verify size. 45U is taller than standard. Standard is 41 or 42U.  	45U is available, gives some extra space consistent with our requirement for future expansion capability, and is not much taller than 42U. 11.  Please verify number of clusters.  Is he correct that you want 1 cluster with 8 nodes/16 processors? or 5 expandable to??  	Yes, requirement is for a cluster with 8 computing nodes/16 processors, with capability for easy future expansion to 24 nodes/48 processors.

<DESC>The work includes three (4) indefinite quantity contracts for miscellaneous design and engineering services for underwater facility assessments of Government waterfront facilities at various locations, worldwide.  The general intention is for the contractor to provide design and engineering services that will be described and procured through appropriate task orders for each contract.  The government intends to set aside two of the four contracts for Small Business.  Two of the four contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis. Small Business size standard is $13.5 million over three years.
  Underwater assessment includes, but is not limited to, underwater inspection; engineering analysis of existing conditions in comparison to design requirements, previous inspection reports and/or drawings of the facilities; engineering calculations for structural analysis with or without previous design calculations; documentation of findings; and recommendations with cost estimates for follow-on actions.  All underwater assessments will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers.  For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC).  That EIC shall supervise the diving, dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports.  The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report.  The EIC shall ensure that all diving is performed in accordance with OSHA standards.  US citizenship is required for access to inspection sites.
Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings and SPECSINTACT specifications; bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; engineering report review; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; engineering calculations; static and dynamic structural and using computer modeling; three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including analysis of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes; water tank inspections in accordance with applicable standards of the American Waterworks Association and NAVFAC MO-210.9; and FHWA certified bridge inspections using NBIS standards for overland and over water bridges.   
  A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment.  This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations.  Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to, piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, potable water storage tanks, dams, water control structures; instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, bridges, underwater cables, or any similar structure.
  The duration of the contracts will be for a period of one base year, with the possibility of two option years.  The guaranteed minimum amount under each contract shall be $20,000 for the base year only.  The estimated total amount contracted for each contract shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year.  The selected firms for these contracts will be required to provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal for each task order.  Each task order will be fixed price. 
   SF 254 and SF 255 provided for consideration should not exceed 20 pages total.  Proposals shall be submitted electronically to collinssj@nfesc.navy.mil or palmorerd@nfesc.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure that proposals were received at the above sites.  Submittals are due no later than 2:30 P.M. EST, March 26, 2002.
     Firms that wish to be considered for this project will be evaluated upon the following criteria.  Criteria numbers one and two are of equal importance and the other criteria are shown in descending order of importance after criteria one and two.
1. Professional qualifications and technical competence of the team proposed for this project in the type of work required.  Professional qualifications include professional registrations of the design personnel assigned to the project.  Qualifications for all diving personnel include the ability to meet OSHA safety standards and dive industry standards.  As well as professional qualifications for design personnel, diving team members will be evaluated upon certifications earned that are generally accepted certifications for the diving industry.
2. Specialized experience in the type of work required.  This criteria includes experience in the following areas:  a.  Design and engineering services for repairs of waterfront structures using destructive and non-destructive (NDT) Tech.   b.  Static and dynamic structural analyses, including seismic vulnerability assessments and vessel/structure interaction analyses of waterfront facilities using computer tools.  Evaluation of both impressed current and sacrificial anode type cathodic protection systems on submerged structures.  c.  Experience with and capability to provide engineering submittals in electronic format(s).  (Submittals will include, but are not limited to:  contract bid documents, web-enabled multimedia inspection reports, three dimensional models and renderings.)
3. Capacity of the firm to perform the work in the required time period.  Capacity includes the firm?s ability to perform multiple tasks concurrently in the required timeframe.  Condition assessment reports will be required with 60 to 120 days after completion of the field inspection, depending upon the number and size of the facilities inspected.
4. Quality control and safety assurance procedures for underwater inspections, report preparation, structural assessments and design services.  A copy of firms? safe diving practices manuals, or diving operations manuals is required for review (the manual will not be returned.)
5. Past performance on projects of similar size and scope.
In addition to the above criteria, the following considerations will be used in the case that firms are found to be equally qualified.  It is the intent of the Department of Navy to award these contracts to firms that are the most highly technically qualified and these considerations will only be used in the case of equally technically qualified firms.
a. Volume of work awarded by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 month with the idea of sharing the wealth of DoD contract dollars among highly qualified firms.
 b. Superior performance on past contracts.  This may be demonstrated by providing copies o design awards, excellent performance evaluations, letters of recognition, etc.
c. Commitments that firms are willing to make to small business,  SDBs, etc., in subcontracting possibilities.

<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) Command and Control (C2) Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of commercial/government off-the-shelf voice and data, beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS), communication technology.  A communication system would be embedded in the front portion of an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod and attached to a fighter aircraft.  Current ACMI configuration is embedded in an Air Intercept Missile (AIM) -9 pod body.  A larger size, AIM-120 (Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM) pod body is an alternative.  The basic premise of this concept is to give the operator BLOS, real-time, voice and data communication capability.  By adding this capability via the ACMI pod, no modifications to the aircraft would be necessary, and the capability could be shifted from aircraft to aircraft as needed.  Specifically, the C2 Battlelab is soliciting information concerning possible prototypes available in three categories.

1) UHF MILSATCOM radio(s) system capable of fitting within the ACMI pod.  The transceiver shall be capable of receiving UHF LOS and UHF SATCOM voice transmissions and transmitting both UHF SATCOM voice and data.  The transceiver shall retransmit the received SATCOM voice signals to the aircraft cockpit.  The retransmitted signals shall be at extremely low power to limit reception to the aircraft?s UHF LOS radio.  The transceiver will receive UHF voice LOS signals from the aircraft UHF radio and retransmit the voice signals via the UHF SATCOM.  The system will transmit a data signal taken from the ACMI pod.

2) A system meeting the preceding requirements that employs other than UHF frequency ranges to accomplish BLOS communication.  This solution must also be capable of fitting within the ACMI pod and provide retransmission of voice to/from the aircraft cockpit via a low power, external UHF signal.  

3) An accompanying system antenna, attachable to the ACMI pod (internally or externally), which will have minimal effect on the overall aircraft aerodynamics.  Since this system will reside in the ACMI pod, it must function properly in the temperature, humidity, vibration, altitude, and other environmental factors encountered by military fighter aircraft, and should conform to applicable sections of MIL-STD-810F.

Through this BAA, the AF is soliciting information concerning mature communication technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a C2 Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all proposals will be the most practical system available to support the requirement.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting any or all of the three categories discussed.  

Submission Information: 
Proposals may be submitted until COB EST, 1 March 2002.  Please submit to Mr. Brian Millard of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at millardb@ctc.com <mailto:millardb@ctc.com>  or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for Market Research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The NAICS code is 541512 with a SBA size standard of $18,000,000.  Interested parties should make it known if they qualify as a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Respondents should also specify whether they are a U.S.- or foreign-owned firm. The U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking responsible sources for the anticipated requirement of sustainment and enhancement of the Air Sovereignty Operations Center (ASOC) software and hardware procured from Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems (LMTS), Eagan MN for ten Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers located in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia; hereafter referred to as Central and Eastern Europe.  This requires providing all management and labor necessary for software maintenance and enhancements for ASOC, an air defense command and control (C2) system.  The term "ASOC" is a US Government-assigned system name. ASOC system security classification is NATO Confidential.  The  ASOC is a Sun Solaris-based air defense command and control system capable of multi-radar tracking using up to 24 sensors.   The typical ASOC has ten operator display workstations. Configurations vary in size from 6 to 12 workstations, with a maximum capacity of 24 workstations. The ASOC processes digitized radar data received from military and civil radars; track data received from the national civil air traffic control center, from selected in-country command centers, and from interfacing ASOCs and interfacing NATO Link-1-capable ground facilities; and flight plan information to provide an integrated air situation display.  The system accepts primary and secondary radar data in EUROCONTROL ASTERIX plot data format, track data in NATO Link-1 and EUROCONTROL ASTERIX track data formats, and flight plan data in ICAO/OLDI formats.  Using the ASOC system, military operators conduct surveillance of the airspace and exercise control over air weapons assets using ground controlled air-to-air intercept guidance capabilities and surface-to-air (SAM) missile control capabilities. The duration of this effort is expected to be for the Basic period from 01 JAN 03 through 31 DEC 03 plus 4 option years.  The Government is seeking responsible sources that can demonstrate the ability to sustain and enhance the existing systems provided by the ASOC system. The potential source shall furnish all management, labor, transportation, tools, equipment, configuration control, and documentation for software and hardware support for the existing systems as delivered by Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems (LMTS), Eagan MN.  The Government requests interested contractors submit a qualification package, not to exceed ten (10) one-sided pages, to the Contracting Officer named above not later than 15 days after release of this synopsis with respect to the key system features discussed above and the following listed screening criteria.  Sources should indicate the offeror's intent to be a prime contractor.  Also, offerors should list any existing contracts that you have that may have similar capabilities, to include a point of contact, preferably a Government Contracting Officer/Program Manager, and telephone number. All proprietary information should be marked as such.  The qualification package for potential sources shall address the following screening criteria:  a. Detail ability to sustain and enhance existing ASOC system.  Include plan to address hardware maintenance activities such as repairing/replacing equipment located in ten Central and Eastern European locations.  Include evidence addressing software maintenance activities such as identifying and trouble-shooting software problem reports, develop, test and disseminate software fixes. b. Detail in-house software and hardware tools, equipment and facilities that would be used to maintain and enhance the ASOC hardware and software. c. Describe relevant experience in managing the acquisition, development, and evolution of software-intensive systems d. Detail ability to maintain and update, as required, ASOC operator, system administration and system maintenance manuals. e. Provide evidence of your effectiveness in establishing and implementing a plan for inserting new technology for improving C2 system operating efficiencies or reducing maintenance cost. f. Detail evidence of a corporate program of compliance with U.S. exports law and regulations. More information may be found at http://www.pmdtc.org/compliance.htm  Interested offerors who respond with their intention to be a prime contractor will be evaluated against the above screening criteria.  Those not meeting the screening criteria will be invited to discuss with the Government their ability to meet the requirements of a prime contractor.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for bid or proposals, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>NA A key critical enabler of the Army's transformation to an objective force is the concurrent transformation of the personnel and human resource systems. To facilitate this vision, the Army G-1 is hosting an Army Personnel Transformation Industry Day on Wedn esday, February 20, 2002. The event will take place at the Defense Systems Management College (DSMC) located on Fort Belvoir, VA, Scott Hall, Bldg. 226, Howell Auditorium. Conference hours are from 8:30 am to 2:00 pm. The Army's vision for Personnel Transformation is to create a single, integrated Army Human Resource System that is simple, relevant, accurate, responsive, timely, and accessible for all soldiers and civilians (Active, Guard and Reserve components). This c apstone system will enable the Army human resource community to provide simple web-enabled applications to the soldiers and civilians, ready and relevant information to commanders and leaders, while transparently integrating multiple complex processes for commanders and soldiers. Personnel Transformation involves the definition and development of a holistic Human Resource System based on redesigned business processes, establishment of a Corporate Database, application of web-enabling applications and techno logies, as well as the integration of quick wins (immediate/near term improvements), and the DoD Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS). To create this system, the Army intends to take advantage of existing web-enabled technology and us e COTS products (commercial-off-the shelf) wherever possible. The Army's primary objectives of Industry Day are to educate and inform potential industry partners on all aspects of the Army Personnel Transformation initiative, and to initiate a dialogue with industry and to gain a better understanding of commercial be st practices, lesson learned, and potential solutions. The Army is looking for strategic partners who can provide recommendations and deliver solutions to the Army's complex human resources challenges. All interested parties are invited to attend and discuss creative ways to achieve this very complex integration effort. Industry attendees will be asked to submit comments, suggestions and concerns once Industry Day is complete. The registration fee to att end is $50.00 per person (no charge for Government personnel). Limited space is available. Please register as soon as possible, and no later than Friday, February 15, 2002 at http://www.ncsievents.com./  For additional information regarding registration pl ease contact the National Conference Services, Inc., Ms. Melissa  Meyers at (301) 596-8899 ext. 206

<DESC>NA Sources Sought OFFADD:  U.S. Army Operations Support Command, ATTN:  AMSOC-CCM-F, Bldg. 350, 6th Floor, Rock Island, IL, 61299-6000 SUBJECT: M72/73/74 Cable Assembly, Bomb Fuze QTY: estimated planning quantity – 27,861 each DUE:  30 days from release – 14 March 02 POC Contract Specialist: Mary C. Hill (309) 782-6654, Procuring Contracting Officer, Mary S. Adams (309) 782-4841. DESC:  The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential production sources for the following:         Cable Assembly         NSN                P/N            M72              1325-00-633-5264      7542966            M73              1325-00-633-5262      7542967            M74              1325-00-633-5263      7542968 The M70 Series Cable Assemblies are the method used to transfer fuze power from the aircraft to electronic bomb fuzes and target detecting devices to initiate the energetic explosive. All are identical except in length. The Cable Assembly has a plastic rec eptacle at one end, approximately 1½ inches in diameter. Extending from the receptacle are two fuze plugs connected by ribbon silicone cordage. The total length of the cordage and fuze plugs is approximately 31 inches for the M72 and slighter longer for th e M73 and M74. One end of the cordage is soldered to the receptacle’s internal electrical contacts and then potted to prevent moisture intrusion.  Metal contacts are soldered to the opposite end of the cordage and then injection molded with silicone rubber . The contacts and silicone rubber form the fuze plug. The Cable Assembly is used to transmit DC/RF voltages from the charging receptacle to the fuzes in the nose and tail of the bomb via the MK122 safety switch. The Cable Assembly is difficult to produce to the exacting First Article and Lot Acceptance Test parameters. Any potential producer of the Cable Assembly must have the critical, specialized tooling and equipment to produce the cable assembly. Some examples of such specialized equipment is a recepta cle (plastic injection) molding machine, multi-cavity fuze plug mold, silicone transfer presses, dies to stamp the split and lock rings, molds for top and bottom seals, soldering fixtures dispensing machine for potting material, humidity and salt spray cha mbers, curing oven optical comparator and continuity/hipot testers. Also, potential producers will have to have a highly trained, skilled, and experienced workforce whom can assure proper bonding of the silicone compound to the contacts and the potting com pound to the receptacle to restrict moisture penetration in order to prevent electrical failures. Additionally, personnel must assure proper adhesion of the molding material to areas without voids. Proper handling of the molding compound is an essential sk ill that is required to be mastered for the molding process. Then proper installation of the spacer ensures necessary alignment of the 300-volt pin, a positional requirement. Certified solderers are also required to assure critical electrical contact of th e components and assembly. The technical data package (TDP) is classified as “Distribution D” limited distribution.  Distribution Statement D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet.  This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the arms export con trol act, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240, ET SEQ.  Violations of these export laws are subject to sever criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 523 0.25.  Interested parties must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the top three drawings (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  After receipt of required certification, request a copy o f the top three drawings via e-mail to, hillm@osc.army.mil. Requests must include Cage Code, Company Name, Address, phone, e-mail address, Certification Number,  and point of contact. A respondent to this market survey must have available the facilities, equipment and skills required to produce the Cable Assembly. Only SERIOUSLY INTERESTED U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of producing the Cable Assemb ly are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief description and summary of their company’s capabilities, including a brief description of facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above crite ria.  Information must be submitted to: HQ, OSC, ATTN:  AMSOS-CCM-F/MARY HILL, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000. Please respond NO LATER THAN 14 MARCH 2002 and identify the “M72/M73/M74 Cable Assembly Sources Sought/Market Research” as the  subject of your response.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The information you provide will only be utilized by OSC in developing its acquisition approach for future requirements.

<DESC>NA Description:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking Industry input (Sources Sought) for a C4I2TSR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Information Technology, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) contract at Air Force Space Command, Peterson AFB, Colorado to provide engineering and technical support on a wide range of C4I2TSR systems.  The services require the capability to integrate, engineer, furnish equipment and materials, install and test (EFI&T) and provide limite d allied support and operations and maintenance for a wide range of current and future C4I2TSR systems world-wide in support of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), United States Space Command (USSPACECOM), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and other government agencies.  The successful contractor will be selected through the Source Selection procedures.  Selection will be made on the basis of technical abilities, management capabilities, and other factors to be determined.  Since an acquisit ion plan has not yet been approved, a determination has not yet been made as to any potential set-asides.  The contract will potentially be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Award Fee Service Contract with yearly dollar amounts ex pected to range between $5,000,000 and $60,000,000, with a total contract not to exceed $300,000,000.  The anticipated contract will have a minimum guarantee of two percent of the stated maximum for the base period or $500,000, whichever is less, and for a ny option period that is exercised, one percent of the stated maximum or $250,000, whichever is less.  The current acquisition strategy includes a base period with five (5) one-year options. NAICS code is anticipated to be 541512, Computer Systems Design S ervices, with Small Business size standards at $18,000,000.  A DRAFT Scope of work will be available at the Omaha District Website,   http://ebs.nwo.usace.army.mil  on or about 15 February 2002.  A pre-proposal conference and the formal Request for Proposa l will not be available until after approval of the Acquisition Plan, approximately four to five months after Industry Day.  Industry Day will be held at HQ, Space Command, Peterson AFB, CO, Hartinger Building (Building 1) in the main floor auditorium on 6  March 2002, beginning at approximately 0900 (Agenda to be posted on the Omaha District Website as soon as it is completed).   Be prepared to eat lunch at your own expense at any authorized base civilian facility; if you go off base for lunch, it may be di fficult reentering the base.  Prior to Industry Day, the Government requests responses to the following questions;  1. With this acquisition potentially being an IDIQ Cost Plus Award Fee type contracting, would your firm (Small or Large Business) have the financial capability or be able to obtain the financial capability to purchase Materials, or provide other required services prior to invoicing? Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) reviews and approves invoicing, once materials have been purchased and/or work has commenced, prior to submission to the Corps of Engineers  for payment.   2. The contractor will be required to purchase/acquire the equipment and or lab space required by the Scope of Work, approximately $2,500,000, then amortize that cost over the expected five year life of the contract (see Section 3.3.3 in the draft Scope of  Work).   Will this requirement affect your financial capabilities? 3. In the current contract, the government convenes an Award Fee board every six months to determine the award fee the contractor is entitled to. If the contract strategy would change to a 2% Base Fee plus an Award Fee, would that action aid in your obtain ing financial capability? 4. Does your firm currently have the necessary approved purchasing system required for a Cost Plus type contract, to receive an award of such a contract?  If not, how would you perform the contract while meeting the requirements for an approved purchasing system? 5. Because of the anticipated size of this acquisition, would offerors potentially enter into a Joint Venture or other teaming arrangement in order to meet the performance requirements of the solicitation? 6. How long a transition period would industry feel necessary to ensure that it was able to perform the contract and present a seamless transition of contract performance to the Government? 7. Could industry hire adequate workforce at time of award of contract with the knowledge and skills needed to perform the contract?   Would it take an extended period of time (30, 60, 90 days) for hiring of qualified personnel to have them in place and tr ained?  8. Would the Colorado Springs local economy support the manpower requirements with the security clearances necessary to perform a contract of this size over an extended period of time? Minimum security requirement for required  personnel is SECRET.  9. What method of security or mode of protection would industry provide for the Government furnished property that would be transitioned to a newly awarded contractor? Please submit your written comments or concerns on the potential acquisition above, and responses to the specific questions to the address(s) below no later that Close of Business 28 February 2002.  An Industry Day is currently scheduled to discuss this co ntract on 6 March 2002 at Peterson AFB, Colorado.

<SUBJECT>D -- A sole source procurment for Information Technology Support Services for the office of Naval Council of Personnel Boards
<DESC>Conversion of JDETS from SQL to Oracle.  The Government intends to award of a sole sources basis, a firm fixed price contract to Kolmus Associates.  If there are any contractor's capable of performing this requirement after reading the background portion of this synopsis, please contact Mr. Richard Weibel at (202) 685-1286 or via eMail at richard_e_weibel@fmso.navy.mil.  The period of performance is for approximately 53 days after date of contract award.  In the event there are an challenges FISCNORVA Det Wash DC will issue a formal RFP.  The Government advises the contractor that challenges this sole source procurement to carefully read the background information enclosed in this synopsis.  1.  Background.  The Physical Evaluation Board administers disability evaluations within the DoN under Chapter 61, Title 10, U. S. Code, Sections 1202-1221 - 05 January 1999, SECNAVINST 1850.4D - 23 December 1998 and other applicable provisions of law and regulation.  The PEB is comprised of the Informal Board that holds a Record Review Panel; and the Formal Board that holds Hearing Panels at Bethesda, MD and San Diego, CA; and the Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officers (PEBLO's) located at eight major medical centers Joint Disability Evaluation System (JDETS) is used by the PEB located at Washington Navy Yard (WNY) and supports the Informal and Formal Hearing Panels in the disability evaluation process.  JDETS is used to store manually entered Medical Board data, prepare case for the Informal Boards, and communicate findings to service members, their command and PEBLO's.  The functional JDETS Proof of Concept Prototype (POCP) version 1.3 for the Navy was installed for production use in late 1996.  It was developed using Powerbuilder 5.1 development software and SQL Base database.  This version of JDETS was intended to be a prototype demonstration for further enhancements to support the Army and Air Force and was not intended to be the final production version.  JDETS 1.3 is operating under SQL Base, a database no longer commercially supported. The system has software anomalies, cannot provide sufficient case tracking capability, and does not fully support tracking all cases.  Creating reports or developing statistical information from the system is cumbersome, time consuming and the accuracy of the results is oftentimes suspect.  There are insufficient field lengths and field edits, and data integrity issues.  The user interface is cumbersome and requires an inordinate level of training.  The application is difficult to install.  The goal of the incremental development process used for JDETS was to get a working prototype into operation and then to enter an evolutionary phase.  NCPB has been operational on the working prototype JDETS 1.3 for 5 years and is preparing to enter that phase in two areas: the operating environment and the application. 
The environment used to support the initial application was a 16-bit operating environment supported by an easily administered SQL-compliant database (SQLBase).  The intent was to move to the Navy's selected standard SQL database after that selection was made.  The Navy has since selected Oracle as the standard database engine. From an application perspective, the Navy has carried out a comprehensive review of JDETS 1.3 with the aim of incorporating a number extensions and corrections and to take advantage of advances in technology since the original implementation.  NCPB has produced a JDETS Change Request List with the results.  Experience gained while participating in development of extensions for the Army (JDETS 1.4) has been part of the Navy review process. Changes which were useful in that context have been included in the Navy's list of proposed changes, and changes which were deemed to detract from the current production version have been dropped and noted for their learning value.  Within the expiration of this notice, FISCNORVA Det Wash DC will issue a contract to Kolmus Associated located in Adelphi, MD.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis a firm fixed price contract to RADARSAT International.  If there are any contractor's capable of performing this requirement, please contact Mr. Richard Weibel at (202) 685-1286 or via eMail at richard_e_weibel@fmso.navy.mil.  The contract is for a base year and two option periods.  In the event that there are challenges to this sole source procurement, FISCNORVA DET Wash DC will issue a formal RFP. The Government advises a contractor that wishes to challenge this procurement to carefully read the enclosed Statement of Work enclosed in this special notice.  The Gatineau Satellite Station shall provide to the Naval Ice Center, Washington, DC, Processed Synthetic aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Canadian space Agency's Radarsat Satellite. These images will be collected and processed by Gatineau with each image covering an area 100km x 100km and processed to a pixel spacing of 30 meters. Each image will be earth located using the best orbit parameters available but with a location uncertainty not to exceed 2km. The location of the satellite will be predicted using sophisticated algorithms since the actual ephemeral data (orbit parameters) is not available until three days after image acquisition.Processed image data, (to include data over areas of an urgent operational nature, data from within the Gatineau reception are and other onboard recorded data ordered by NIC) in the CSA delivery format used by Gatineau of the Chesapeake and Delaware by the real time (i.e., with 206 hours after the satellite captures the data) will be delivered to the Naval Ice Center. The delivery format is the CSA interpretation of the Committee for Earth Observation Science format. Data requests from the naval Ice Center will be processed through the Alaskan Sar Facility (ASF). The ASF will submit the request via Canada to Gatineau one (1) week prior to the desired satellite pass but may, occasion, submit a request within 12 hours of a scheduled pass. The processed SAR image data will be made available to the Naval Ice center within six (6) hours of each designated satellite pass using existing communication circuits between the Naval Ice Center and Gatineau (i.e., the internet and its standard protocol).  The Naval ice Center may report to Gatineau on the quality of the SAR data transferred via the internet and on the usefulness of such SAR data as input in the ice forecast model used. A monthly report on the number of images transmitted and received within the required six (6) hours turn-around period of each applicable request will be issued by the Naval Ice Center and Gatineau.  With in the expiration of this notice FISCNORVA Det Wash will issue a contract to RADARSAT International located in Richmond British Columbia, Canada.

UNLESS OTHERWISE CHALLENGED, AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE SYNOPSIS PERIOD TEN DAYS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE FISCNORVA DET WASH DC WILL AWARD A FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT TO METRO SERVICES. IF THERE ARE ANY PARTIES INTERESTED IN RECEIVING A COPY OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK PLEASE CONTACT MR. RICHARD WEIBEL AT (202) 685-1286 OR VIA eMAIL AT richard_e_weibel@fmso.navy.mil.  Enclosed is a brief background of the requirements.  The Contingency Deployment Database System (CDDS), developed by the Defense Logistics Information Service, integrates program applications with a deployment matrix tracking tool.  Once operational, the CDDS will assist DLA personnel in managing the DLA Contingency Support Team (DCST) deployment process more efficiently and effectively.  The mission objective of the CDDS is to support JV 2010 and JV 2020 by providing timely access to comprehensive and accurate data, as well as enhancing and accelerating DLA's support to the Joint Warfighter by rapidly identifying DCST members.  Because of this mission objective, this system is being designed to manage all DLA DCS teams.  During Phase I testing, already in progress, CDDS is populated with live data to determine the adequacy of the programming.  It is anticipated that Phase II testing will begin in February 2002, and will add expanded capability to allow the PLFAs to input deployment data via the worldwide web.  The contractors involvement in CDDS Phase II testing will be consistent with the requirements identified in Phase I testing.  Follow-on employment of an approved CDDS will require continued contractor support, including all the requirements levied under Phase I and Phase II testing.  CDDS will enable the potential DCST applicants to access/execute routine administrative information and tasks such as submitting deployment information, accessing class schedules and receiving welcome letters.  Data resident in CDDS will be extracted for use in preparation of travel orders.  The contractor shall have access to classified information.  A DD Form 254 "Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification" will be required.
