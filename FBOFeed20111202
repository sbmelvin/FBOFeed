A contract modification reflecting this extension and resultantincrease in the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) of the contract will be issued on or beforeDecember 31, 2011, the expiration date of the current protective services contract.Contract NNA04CI14T, awarded as a result of full and open competition under a GSASchedule to SECTEK Inc., on June 1, 2004, provides protective services which includessecurity, emergency response, risk assessment, vulnerability analyses, innovative andstrategic recommendations for security enhancements and upgrades, international visitorrequests, infrastructure security and badging operations, safeguards andcounterintelligence services.  Additional services include staffing a 24/7 operationduring emergency or disaster periods.	 This three-month extension is necessary to maintain the critical continuity of protectiveservices until the current procurement process for the follow-on contract has beencompleted and a new contract awarded. Because SECTEK Inc. provides unique expertise inmeeting the protective services requirements of the Center, no alternate source couldadequately provide for the maintenance of the Centers comprehensive security preventionprogram during this brief extension period. Award to another source during theprocurement phase of the follow-on contract would result not only in substantialduplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered throughcompetition, but also unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>JOANNE M. MURPHY, Contracting Officer, Email joanne.murphy@bsee.gov
<DESC>&lt;DESC&gt;Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number E12PS00004 for Proposed Research on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental ShelfDESCRIPTION:The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Technology Assessment and Research (TA&amp;R) Program on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf. When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research. For a summary of TA&amp;R research recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering<br />.aspx. Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.<br />BACKGROUND: <br />The BSEE TA&amp;R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals. Proposals selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding from FY 2012. The BSEE anticipates $5,000,000, based on funding availability, for the initiation of new research addressing topics identified through this announcement. Please keep proposals under $1,000,000. NOTICE: The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review. Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE. The BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. <br />OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2012 safety research funding should be limited to the following topics: <br />1. Assess Kick Detection Regulations<br />Identify and assess recently developed equipment and technologies capable of and/or designed to detect kicks and analyze current requirements for any possible improvements to those requirements.<br />Explore methods of kick detection before an influx rises above the BOP stack and the effect of water depth on prompt kick detection and response times.
<p>2. Optimize Blow Out Preventer (BOP) Stack Sequencing and Centralization, Stack Configuration, and Flowing Well Conditions. <br />Assess BOP stack sequencing, which includes auto-shear and dead-man systems for deep-water rigs, to optimize the order and time when rams should be closed to secure a well. For BOP systems that require centralization of pipe to seal/cut, assess centralization when the drill pipe is compressed or forced from center. Include effects of a fully flowing well (e.g., blowout conditions) on the ability of a subsea BOP to shear pipe and ways to improve blind shear design. Also, include improved BOP stack configuration to minimize unsupported pipe in order to reduce likelihood of elastic buckling.</p>
<p>3. Subsea Blow Out Preventer (BOP) Monitoring and Well Control.<br />Perform an evaluation of methods for detecting failure and monitoring the BOP and using state of the art technology to prevent failure.<br />Explore the reliability of a complete independent, acoustically controlled system for subsea BOP (short stack) in deep-water Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>4. Comparison of Synthetic Mooring Design, Manufacturing, and Installation Requirements.<br />API RP 2SM and the ABS Guide to Synthetic Mooring System have both been revised and published or submitted for approval this past year. Compare and explain differences between the old and new versions of the documents, particularly with regard to the design, testing, and manufacturing. In the updated documents explain how each change individually and collectively affects the safety factor and conservatism of overall design.</p>
<p>5. Corrosion Damage of Risers and Structures. <br />Evaluate the methods of detection, monitoring, and inspection of corrosion damage of risers and subsea/splash-zones. <br />6. Cement Comparison: Laboratory vs. Field Determine whether laboratory formulations, testing, analysis, etc. are adequate to accurately reflect cement characteristics during offshore field implementation. <br />7. Impact of Implementing the Safety and Environmental Management System requirements. <br />Develop a methodology to evaluate the impact of implementing the safety and environmental management system (SEMS) requirements on OCS oil and gas industry performance (30 CFR part 250 subpart S). Gather Baseline data beginning with calendar year 2012.</p>
<p>8. Deep-water Pipeline and Pipeline Riser Pressure Testing Methods Describe and review pressure testing methods for pipelines and pipeline risers located in 1000 feet to 10000 feet of water on the OCS.<br />Pipelines in deep water may either be un-insulated pipe, insulated pipe or pipe-in-pipe. Identify the positive and negative attributes of each pressure testing method and identify if any methods are superior.</p>

<DESC>1.	Background
The FAA is charged with maintaining the safest, most efficient airspace system in the world. The National Airspace System (NAS) consists of a complex collection of systems, procedures, facilities, aircraft, and people. The NAS and the technologies it uses are constantly evolving. With increasing demand for flights in limited airspace, the FAA is constantly working to balance demand and capacity by minimizing delays and congestion while maximizing volume. The Air Traffic Organization represents the Terminal, En Route, System Operations, and Technical Operations workforces that ensure safety and efficiency within the NAS. The Technical Operations workforce includes those charged with installation, testing, troubleshooting, repair, monitoring, and certification of systems and equipment used to maintain the NAS.  As Technical Operations hires new employees to ensure its facilities are safely staffed for the air traffic of tomorrow, the Office of Technical Operations Training Administration serves as a bridge to the future by providing technical training programs that meet requirements set by the operational service units.
2.	Introduction/Purpose
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to maintain its resource base of technicians educated to maintain and repair existing Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) equipment provided by Eaton Power Quality Corporation. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has UPS equipment, purchased by Eaton Power Quality Corporation, in multiple sites throughout the United States.  Technicians trained to repair and maintain this equipment are critical to preserve a healthy building environment sufficient for housing personnel.  The goal is to train FAA technicians on the Eaton Power Quality UPS equipment; to provide an introduction to the equipment by explaining the composition, function and components; and to provide instruction on equipment processes, repair and maintenance.
The FAA is looking for a suitable vendor to provide delivery of training to our technicians on this proprietary equipment for the following courses.
FAA49400007 Powerware 9390 50-160 KVA.  5-Day Course.  This course covers the meaning of unique individual specifications of each model of the Powerware 9390, 50-160 KVA UPS.  Students will learn to verify correct installation; perform initial software set-up of the UPS; return the UPS to service after emergency maintenance is performed; remotely communicate with the UPS interrogate microprocessor diagnostics when troubleshooting; set up UPS options including remote notify.  FAA48292-9315.  5-Day Course.  Course provides Level II (ADV) training for technicians and engineers on Exide UPS 180/500 KVA Balanced Power (BP) III.  It is 50% lecture and 50% lab.  This course reviews and expands on topics covered in Level I Training.  Advanced troubleshooting procedures are described to further enhance the user in differentiating between hardware and software problems.  This course is designed for individuals who perform installation verification and full maintenance of the UPS equipment including parallel redundant configuration.  This course is also designed for individuals who provide technical support and basic training to on-site personnel.  
FAA48281-9315.  5-Day Course.  Course provides training for technicians on the Exide Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) Powerware Plus 180/500 KVA BP III.  This course is 40% lecture and 60% laboratory.  Subjects include troubleshooting, restoration, and system procedures.  Eaton Power Quality Corporation currently provides all training for their UPS equipment.  The Eaton Power Quality Corporation courseware is proprietary; the FAA does not have data rights to the courseware; the FAA will not provide courseware to vendors. 
The FAA requires that the provider conduct the classes on a daily one-shift basis, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday through Friday.  Training will be continuous during these days except for federally established holidays.  
3.     Incumbent Contractor 
The FAA has a current contract with Eaton Power Quality Corporation to provide training on UPS equipment.  The FAA has identified the need for additional courses over the next four years.  The additional quantity of courses required will triple the quantity of courses on the current contract.  4.     Market Survey
The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at present.  The agency may consider either a full and open competition or award to a single source, depending on responses to the market survey.
5.     Market Research Standard

<CONTACT>Christine S. Biser, Contract Specialist, Phone 3015949987, Fax 3014804226, Email ChristineBi@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The mission of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is to conduct and support research on many of the most serious diseases affecting public health. The institute supports much of the clinical research on the diseases of internal medicine and related subspecialty fields, as well as many basic science disciplines. Among these diseases are end-stage liver diseases. To understand the pathophysiology of these diseases, it is essential to provide researchers with access to liver tissue and cells from a variety of end-stage liver diseases, as well as normal livers. These specimens would not be available to researchers who work outside a liver transplant center.<br /><br />The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) requires an organization to provide the infrastructure for procurement and distribution of liver tissues and cells from a variety of end-stage liver diseases and normal livers to basic scientific investigators. The requirement seeks to facilitate the distribution of discarded liver tissue to qualified investigators to stimulate research on liver diseases. Recipients of cells and tissue from diseased livers are primarily investigators whose projects have been vetted by the NIDDK grant process. Available supplies of isolated hepatocytes from normal liver currently dictate that these are provided only to investigators at the National Institutes of Health.
<p>The scope of the program is comprised of procuring, isolating, purifying, preserving and distributing donor liver tissue, as well as reporting on this process. Donor tissue shall include whole or sectioned human liver tissue that is normal or shows pathology from a variety of liver diseases. This tissue shall be processed into liver tissue blocks (frozen, paraffin embedded,), hepatocytes suitable for cellular and molecular studies, and other preparations.</p>
<p>To facilitate progress in liver research, to respond to the need of the investigators and to assess the evolution of the services, the contractor shall obtain periodic input from the scientific community regarding the provision of other liver specimens, particularly non-parenchyma cells.</p>
<p>The requirement shall consist of the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Clinical tasks, focused primarily on procuring donor tissue in a clinical setting. Specifically, the requirement shall include obtaining informed consent of organ donors; building a synopsis of donor's medical history and laboratory data; collecting whole or partial livers; and delivering this to a biotech laboratory for further processing.</p>
<p>2. Technical tasks, focused primarily on the isolating, purifying, and preserving the liver tissue in a biotech laboratory setting. The primary objective for tissues prepared with cryopreservation or histology techniques is a preparation that clearly preserves characteristic structures and pathology. The primary objective for cells is to maintain a high rate of cell viability.</p>
<p>3. Order Management tasks, focusing primarily on distributing the tissue to basic investigators. The primary objective is to deliver specimens in excellent condition; process financial accounting information; and track the production process. The system shall receive user requests; review and prioritize requests; maintain a fee schedule; receive and process payments; and communicate with investigators via a website; and support activities of a Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p>4. Reporting tasks, focusing primarily on collecting, analyzing and reporting data on the tasks described above. Specifically, data shall be presented on demographics, metrics, quality control, cost information, inventories, transaction activity and benefits of the program, such as the citations of publications resulting from this service. These data shall be analyzed and presented in graphic form. The requirement includes the ability to customize data queries, export query results to spreadsheet applications and graphically summarize and print query results. This task shall support the Coordinating Committee's strategic decision-making by providing the following types of information: review of operating procedures, quality control procedures, tissue processing procedures, information storage and management procedures, and operating policies ensuring equitable access to contract services.</p>
<p>A cost-reimbursement type contract using NAICS code 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), is contemplated. NLM intends to award a contract consisting of a base award and four option years on or about July 29, 2012. FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to compete this procurement with full and open competition. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals will be released on or about December 21, 2011 at the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<p>It is EPA's intent to award one (1) performance based, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a hybrid cost reimbursement and fixed price components at the work assignments level. The Government reserves the right to make contract type a matter of negotiation. The contract's period of performance shall be for a one-year base period with four one-year option periods for a total contract performance period of five (5) years.</p>
<p>Detailed information for this requirement is provided through the Performance Work Statement (PWS); Conflicts of Interest (COI) Clauses; the Minimum Standards for EPA Contractors' Conflict of Interest Plans; and other associated documents which will be posted on the EPA's website at the following address:</p>
<p>http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/hcsc/eras/index.htm<br /><br />The EPA has identified a need to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual and potential contractor conflicts of interest (COI). It is imperative that the selected contractor be beyond reproach and free from any improper influence or bias, as the potential for conflict could dramatically erode public confidence in EPA?s ability to accomplish its mission of protecting human health and the environment. Prospective offerors are hereby notified that they must address and comply with the COI concerns, provisions, and clauses in the RFP. The following provisions and clauses will be included in the solicitation and resulting contract(s) to avoid COI:</p>
<p><strong>A. Solicitation Stage</strong></p>
<p>To mitigate significant potential for COI the following provisions will appear in the solicitation:</p>
<p>Section K - ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-72) (APR 1984)<br />Section L- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-70) (APR 1984)<br />Section L- CONFLICT OF INTERST PLAN (LOCAL LC-09-04) (DEC 2001)<br />The plan described in section L entitled "conflict of Interest Plan" will be evaluated as acceptable or not acceptable. Notwithstanding the evaluation of an offeror with respect to the technical evaluation criteria or the evaluation of an offeror's cost, an offeror that submits a plan that ultimately is unacceptable at the time of award will not be eligible for contract award. The contractor's COI plan will be evaluated as part of the contractor's responsibility determination.<br />Section L- DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST<br />Section M- EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN (LOCAL LRT-09-07) (DEC 2001)</p>
<p>The full text for EPAAR provisions and clauses can be found at the following website:<br /><br />http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=52c48b59c02b4481b8576a658c6e69ab&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title48/48cfrv6_02.tpl</p>
<p><strong>B. Contract Management</strong></p>
<p>The contract will require the contractor to certify annually that no conflicts or potential conflicts of interest exist, or that they have been disclosed or mitigated. In addition, the contractor must certify that all personnel who are to perform work under a task order have been informed of their obligation to report any personal or organizational COI, and that the contractor understands its continuing obligation to search for and to report any COI. The solicitation and resultant contract will also contain the following COI contract clauses:</p>
<p>Section H- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (EPAAR 1552.209-71) (MAY 1994)<br />Section H- NOTIFICATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST REGARDING PERSONNEL (EPAAR 1552.209-73) (MAY 1994) <br />Section H - ANNUAL CERTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-75) (MAY 1994)<br />Section H - PROJECT EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (EPAAR 1552.227-76) (MAY 1994)</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify sources capable of manufacturing the Flexible Linear Shaped  Charge, 225 Grains Per Foot, NSN:  1375-01-079-3905, DODIC:  ML15.  This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the United States Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, to determine interest in a potential Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 procurement for the 225 GPF Flexible Linear Shaped Charge.  The Government anticipates inclusion of evaluated option quantities for the item, for a total estimated contract length of 3-5 years.  <br><br>Item Description:  The ML15 is a flexible linear charge comprised of a continuous explosive core enclosed in a seamless lead sheath.  The charge is shaped in the form of an inverted "V", the continuous liner and explosive produce a linear cutting action.  The explosive core consists of 225 grains of CH-6 explosive per foot.  This charge can be primed for either electrical or nonelectrical firing or by nonelectric detonator firing.  After the charge is prepared for firing operation of the source of power activates a blasting cap or another applicable priming system which, in turn, detonates the CH-6 explosive.  The 225 grains per foot charges are packed 15 four-foot lengths per metal container. <br><br>The manufacturing process of the ML15 encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) extruding the explosive with the lead sheath, (2) marking equipment for the charge and packaging, and (3) load, assemble, and pack (LAP) of the item.  For different stages of the manufacturing process, special inspection and test equipment is required to ensure that the final products comply with Government requirements.  The Contractor will be required to provide First Article and Lot Acceptance samples to the Government for First Article Acceptance and Lot Acceptance tests on the Charges.  Production of the Flexible Linear Charges requires the special capability to extrude CH-6 explosive with a lead sheath.  The Flexible Linear Shaped Charges are procured to a U.S. Government Technical Data Package (TDP).  The Government anticipates providing the CH-6 explosive as Government Furnished Material for this planned contract.  <br><br>The entire U.S. Government TDP will not be provided for this announcement; however a top-level drawing is available for interested sources.  The ML15 top-level drawing is Distribution Statement C, which means distribution is authorized to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors.  Interested contractors that would like to obtain the top-level drawing must submit a written request to the POC identified below.  The written request must include the company's cage code and Joint Certification Number (JCP) (see http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/).

<DESC>This requirement defines the Omnibus Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (OSETA) support services for the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) and all subordinate Joint Program managers (JPMs) and their project and product offices. This is a Non-Commercial Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with, when applicable, performance based task orders for the Joint Program Executive Office-Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and other customers under the auspices of the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP).   The support required by this contract is categorized into five domain area requirements:  Program Management, Administrative, and Management Support; Specialty Medical; Engineering Management; Logistics and Sustainment and Electronics and Communication.  Offerors are permitted to propose as the Prime Contractor for only one of the five domains.  The cumulative total of all task orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $498,000,000 over the life of the contract.  The Government anticipates that there is a strong potential for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) to materialize over the life of the contract.  Organizational conflicts of interest occur when a firm has access to nonpublic information that would give it an advantage in competing for work. Conflicts also could appear when a contractor is performing tasks that are subjective and could have a financial impact. These situations would include a company helping to prepare a statement of work and then bidding on the same project.  Due to the limitations of the 2009 Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act and DFARS Clause 252.209-7009(c) (Dec 2010), this action will be 100% set aside to Small Businesses. NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, applies with a small business size standard exception of $27,000,000.   Offerors are strongly encouraged to joint venture, team with small businesses or establish a small business entity.  Performance of this requirement may include access or exposure to private information subject to compliance to FAR Subpart 52.224-1 and 52.224-2.  Performance of this requirement does include strict prohibition of dissemination of information / publishing that is subject to compliance with client requirements and data that is subject to data right restrictions by the client.  Any violation of such may result in administration of penalties.  The expectation is that one or more Firm-Fixed Price type contracts will be awarded and such recipients need not have an approved accounting system, but are still subject to restrictions/guidelines associated with defective pricing.

<DESC>THIS RFI IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE AIR FORCE TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT.
<p>TO: All Potential Respondents</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) to Support the Air Force's Financial Improvement and<br />Audit Readiness (FIAR) Requirements</p>
<p>Background: The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Directorate of Financial Management (SAF/FM) developed the Air Force Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) to assist financial managers in their decision-making processes by providing relevant and reliable financial information. A major objective of this plan is to achieve an unqualified or "clean" audit opinion for each Air Force financial statement. In response to the FIP, each organization within the Air Force is responsible for: identifying measureable steps to ensure that each financial End to End (E2E) business process is auditable; ensuring that all major accounting and reporting deficiencies are resolved; and providing dates when approved areas will be ready for validation and audit by independent external auditors.</p>
<p>The FIP process requires developed assertion packages that fully describe "audit trail" information for each E2E business process and provide compliancy information for each primary and feeder system involved in the development of these financial statements. This information is compiled and incorporated into each management assertion package.</p>
<p><br />If you meet the qualifications as specified in the attached Request for Information and are interested in proposing on this acquisition, we request you respond to this RFI with a short statement of your capabilities (no longer than two (2) pages in length), addressing the qualifications below. Responses are to be submitted electronically to Mr. Brian Halston no later than 12 December 2011 at 12:00 PM EST.</p>
<p><br />THIS RFI IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE AIR FORCE TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government shall not pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of responses to the RFI. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development.</p>
<p>By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which the Financial Operations, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Management and Comptroller, releases and disseminates the information for review. As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as, or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) such information submitted may be disclosed to third parties, and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information.</p>
<p>This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not intend to award a contract at this time. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<SUBJECT>Towards Maximizing the Scientific Return on the Womens Health Initiative Biological Resource
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-CSB-WH-SS-13-01
<CONTACT>Stacy C. Turner, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-6676, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email turners@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND

The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) has unique features that make it extraordinarily valuable for laboratory studies aimed at enhancing understanding of the role of genetic and blood markers in disease etiology. It is very large (enrolling 161 thousand women), it is diverse, it comprises the largest cohort of older women (~30,000 are now over age 80), it has a long follow-up (up to 19 years), serially collected and stored bloods, extensive phenotyping, carefully adjudicated data on large numbers of clinical outcomes, and it includes three clinical trial exposures. The latter feature leverages opportunities to study mechanisms of treatment effects on disease outcomes, both short-term and long-term. 

The WHI program has set aside bloods (serum and plasma) and DNA samples for the purpose of this acquisition. Archived bloods are available at baseline, and either 1 year for clinical trials participants or 3 years observational study participants. In addition, follow-up bloods and clinical examination data will be obtained from 8000 participants aged 78+ in 2012, which provides an important opportunity to study questions related to aging including absence or presence of cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors, maintaining good physical and cognitive function, and the predictors of change in biomarkers, DNA methylation and RNA expression, telomere length and the interrelationships of markers in their association with health status. It is anticipated the laboratory assays may include newer high-throughput technologies such as those from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. 

ACQUISITION PLAN

This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals that will maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data in the Womens Health Initiative (WHI), by soliciting the best ideas for laboratory-based research studies to apply to the WHI biologic resource.

This BAA is the third of a series. Altogether 22 contracts were awarded in 2007 and in 2009. This BAA will differ from the previous ones in several respects: it will focus on study questions relevant to the NHLBI mission and in particular factors leading to an increased risk of CVD in older women (and conversely factors leading to healthy aging with absence of CVD); it will encourage the application of multiple technologies (using biospecimens) in an integrated fashion; and it will explicitly require involvement of early stage investigators.  

The BAA mechanism encourages wide access to the bio-specimens, while still allowing for coordination of specimen use, achieving programmatic balance, and wide data sharing. This mechanism is in addition to the regular ancillary study mechanisms mostly funded through ROIs where access to the resource is governed by study investigators. Study investigators welcome wide collaboration and details of procedures for establishing collaborations can be found at www.whiscience.org.

EVALUATION PLAN

Awards will be made based on the weighted evaluation factors of technical merit, programmatic balance, and funds availability. It is anticipated that the individual award amounts will vary depending on the scope and capacity of the technical objectives for the award. Two to four awards are anticipated, in the range of approximately $1.5 to $3.5 million each in early calendar year 2013. Costs are anticipated to be somewhat lower during the first year which includes planning, finalizing sample selection, receiving samples, and preliminary laboratory analyses. Higher costs are likely to be incurred during the second year when samples are run at full capacity. During the third year costs are likely to be somewhat lower as laboratory data are finalized and statistical analyses and manuscript preparation are done. At the sole discretion of the NHLBI, meritorious proposals that cannot be funded within the amount currently available under this BAA may be forwarded to other Institutes and/or Centers under the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for their consideration.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is interested in identifying sources with the requisite capabilities and qualifications to develop an interim platform for providing access and functionality to the Neuro-QOL, which is an instrument for assessing quality of life outcomes in neurological disorders. The Neuro-QOL instrument was developed under a contract that ended on September 30, 2010 with delivery to the government of all instruments, programs, algorithms, and related documentation. In order to make the instrument available for researchers to use, a platform needs to be developed to support access, implementation, and maintenance. In the near future NINDS expects to release a solicitation for long-term maintenance of the Neuro-QOL. Thus, in order to make the instruments and documentation available to researchers to begin testing and using Neuro-QOL, as well as to potential offerors to aid in their proposals for a future solicitation, we need to have an interim platform that will be publicly available.</p>
<p>The NINDS anticipates initiating a contract to design and develop a web-based platform that will allow researchers or clinicians to create study-specific web-based data collection pages; will include all Neuro-QOL instruments that include Computer Adaptive Testing for administration to research participants; will provide for scoring and exporting of data; and will provide technical support and consultation to researchers on the use of Neuro-QOL instruments, including data collection and data export functions. In addition, the contractor will conduct up to 3 training sessions/workshops to introduce researchers to the development and methodology of Neuro-QOL, provide education on IRT, CAT, and item bank construction, and train investigators in the use of the web-based Neuro-QOL platform in their research. We anticipate that these requirements will be completed in a one-year period.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> On September 30, 2004, NINDS awarded a contract to develop a psychometrically robust health-related quality of life (HRQL) measurement tool that is accepted by the neurology clinical trials and clinical research communities. The contractor developed, tested, and completed validation of the required instruments and provided all required deliverables. As of September 30, 2010, 13 adult and 9 pediatric item banks or scales, totaling more than 700 questions, were delivered to NINDS, along with supporting reports, a comprehensive user manual, and a plan for sustainability of Neuro-QOL. The feasibility of the sustainability plan and subsequent deliberations and decisions by NINDS will determine the best way to manage the distribution and delivery of Neuro-QOL so that it is freely available to the NIH-sponsored clinical research community. To some degree, sustainability is enabled through posting print-ready instruments on the Neuro-QOL website for download; however, this does not provide the user with a system for administering a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) or collecting other Neuro-QOL short-form instruments online. Simply posting the instruments also does not provide for the substantial need for expert consulting in their use and interpretation and the technical support required by clinical researchers who wish to use Neuro-QOL but may lack expertise in patient reported outcomes measurement.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION REQUESTED:</strong> With consideration to the above, the NINDS is requesting the following specific information as part of our market research efforts in support of this potential requirement. In a requirement-specific Capability Statement, document your organizational and technical abilities and related scientific and managerial experience and capabilities for the following activities: 1) establishing a web-based platform to make available for public access the Neuro-QOL instruments, CAT, and scoring algorithms; 2) providing technical support and consultation to researchers in the use of the Neuro-QOL materials, including data collection and data export functions; 3) providing ongoing technical support and consultation with respect to research design, instrument selection, analysis and interpretation; 4) hosting the Neuro-QOL website, refining and upgrading the website's quality and functionality, and improving Neuro-QOL's visibility targeting appropriate components of the research community; 5) conducting up to 3 training sessions and/or workshops to introduce researchers to the development and methodology of Neuro-QOL, to provide education on IRT, CAT, and item bank construction, and to train investigators in the use of the web-based Neuro-QOL platform in their research.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future requirement for a small business set-aside or an open competition to include both large and small business, a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement will be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 or fewer employees. Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52-219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Submitted Capability Statements must address how the business meets the applicable size standard designated for this project.</p>
<p>All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Educational Institution, Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a).</p>
<p>If submitting hard copies, please send to: Laurie A. Leonard, Contracting Officer, National Institutes of Health, NINDS R&amp;D CMB, 6001 Executive Blvd., Suite 3287, Bethesda, MD 20892-9531 or via courier to Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<p>Description/Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration anticipates a future procurement for construction services necessary to stabilize, conserve, and selectively restore portions of the Clara Barton Museum Building, a District of Columbia boarding house where Clara Baron, founder of the American Red Cross, lived and worked during and immediately following the American Civil War. Open to the public, the Clara Barton Building will serve as a one-of-a-kind museum documenting life in a mid-nineteenth century boarding house. Museum patrons will experience the intimate, long forgotten spaces (approximately 4,000 SF) Clara Barton inhabited while conducting inquiries into lost in action, Civil War soldiers. The estimated construction cost range is between $1,000,000.00 and $3,000,000.00. All work shall be performed <br />in accordance with the GSA's authorized and approved standards found in 2010 Facilities Standards for the Public Building Service (P-100), the standards in the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, the standards in National Park Service, and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitation, Restoring, &amp; Reconstructing Historic Buildings. Situated inside a privately owned building in which GSA holds an in-perpetuity preservation easement, the museum shall encompass portions of the basement and first floor and the entire third floor. The third floor contains fragile original finishes that must be stabilized and preserved while building systems are carefully integrated to avoid harming historic materials or the character of spaces occupied by Barton.</p>
<p>Construction services include, but are not limited to, the following: preservation project scope management, selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors, including conservators and systems experts specializing in restoration; administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts; coordination of regular construction meetings; critical path method (CPM) scheduling and scheduling control, maintaining construction records, including daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring construction costs; progress reporting; resolving unforeseen challenges associated with the historic space conditions and requirements, conduction and coordinating inspections and testing to ensure proper functioning of the building; coordination of commissioning and turnover to the designated building management staff and tenants; performing closeout procedures and all other required services necessary for a complete historical museum. Experience managing comparable house museum restoration and rehabilitation requirements to DOI and AMA standards is required.</p>

If you are responding to this Notice from outside the geographic location of the work, please provide a narrative detailing how you would perform the work at a fair and reasonable price to the Government.</p>
<p>Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor not being considered as an interested concern.</p>

The locations include remote, mountainous, rural, and/or metropolitan sites. A yearly site lease is established where ATF communications equipment is housed and renewed annually thereafter as long as there is an existing need for LMR coverage to support ATF operations. THIS IS A PARTIAL SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. Eight (8) of these requirements are for large businesses and one (1) is for a small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 531390 with a size standard of $2 million dollars.

The NSET Subcommittee is the coordinating body for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). <br />The NSET Subcommittee has approved a budget that includes funds for NNCO to subscribe to the LRNI service for FY12. This service will provide access for all NSET Subcommittee members to the series of reports on nanotechnology that LUX Research has prepared over the past several years, and any new reports that they publish over the coming year. These reports are the most frequently cited source of information on nanotechnology investment trends and market opportunities, both within the United States and around the world.<br />The breadth of detailed information available through the LRNI service is not available from any other source. The NSET Subcommittee requires access to the LUX Research information in order to be better able to compare other sources of information to the LUX Research information, and therefore to evaluate the validity of the highly cited LUX Research reports. Purchasing this subscription to the LRNI service will also provide NNCO staff members and NSET Subcommittee members with direct access to LUX Research analysts who prepared these reports, and will therefore enable direct communication concerning the methodologies that LUX has been using to develop its nanotechnology reports, thus allowing for better assessment of the validity of those reports.&nbsp; The period of performance will be the base year of&nbsp;January 1, 2012 -December 31, 2012, with one option year with a period of Janaury 1, 2013 - December 31, 2013.&nbsp; Firms that beleivve they can supply an eqivalent product are invited to submit capability statements no later than December 9, 2011, for consideration by the NSF.<br />

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Sole Source to PerkinElmer for Instrument Repair Contract
<SOLNBR>

<a href="mailto:Fisher.Trina@epa.gov">Fisher, Trina</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 811219
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. for purchase of a One Year Repair Coverage Service Contract for three PerkinElmer instrument systems.
Scope and Capabilities: Repair Coverage Service Contracts are necessary to ensure that these four instruments are operating at their optimum performance, and to ensure that they are maintained in a safe condition.  The four instrument systems are: PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV, serial # 077N5121301,  PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV, serial # 077C8060201, PerkinElmer ElanDRCII, serial #Al12870707, and PekinElmer Series 200 Peltier oven, serial # OVP0910151912, Series 200 Quaternary pump, serial # 291N9101302A, Series 200 Autosampler, serial # 293N9100502A. The requirements for all four instrument systems on Repair Coverage Service Contract include: Service calls are given priority status over non-service agreement holders, all parts (excluding consumables), labor, and travel expenses of the field service engineer to maintain this instrument in normal working operation, and free telephone troubleshooting and technical support.  Additional Requirements for all four instrument systems on  Repair Coverage Service Contract include: Timely responses to service calls.  Service engineer(s) should be stationed locally in order to respond rapidly and minimize instrument down-time.  Initial service calls must be responded to within 24 hours and an on-site visit by the service engineer must occur within 48 hours;  Must be factory-trained and must stay up-to-date with PerkinElmer?s instrument specific service bulletins;  Must be able to analyze the instrument specific software?s failure log; and Must have extensive knowledge of the specific instrument software.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE  PerkinElmer is the company that manufactures the Optima 5300 DV, the Elan DRCII, and LC and is the best source of service for all these instruments. Performance issues are best known by the service engineers of the manufacturing company. In addition, this kind of information is distributed to PerkinElmer service engineers as a ?service data bulletin? Service engineers from PerkinElmer are more informed about any developing problems and the subsequent repairs or replacement parts needed in order to repair and improve these instruments as a result of their access to these service bulletins. A service provider other than PerkinElmer may not be able to readily access this information or even acquire any service issue updates relevant to the instrument. All PerkinElmer service engineers have access to applications specialists in their instrumentation area and are able to contact the design engineers for the specific instrument to  discuss problems and find solutions. Open access to such specific application and design expertise would not be available through another service provider. Furthermore, PerkinElmer service engineers have extensive training in the instrument software systems. Since these instruments are now controlled by software commands, it is critical that a service provider have a complete understanding of the software. The software is essential in diagnosing instrument problems and has `hidden? areas for a trained service engineer to access in order to determine what problems have occurred with the instrument. Any other service provider not the manufacturer may not have complete knowledge of this software. Lastly, a rapid service response time is necessary for all of these instrument systems. PerkinElmer has a local service engineer with an excellent service response record making it unlikely that there would be excessive instrument down-time. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is  capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST 10 calendar days after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC><br>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North, Fort Detrick, MD, intends to negotiate a Sole Source procurement with OpGen, Gaithersburg, MD to provide a Argus Optical Mapping System, to the USAFSAM, Brooks City Base, TX.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Point of contact Jessica Ely, Contract Specialist, e-mail: Jessica.ely@us.army.mil<br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br>The Air Force Surgeon Genera funded project entitled "Evaluation of Full Genome Restriction Mapping for the Detection of Disease" requires the use of an Argus Optical Mapping System for its successful completion.  No other vendor can currently manufacture or provide an instrument with the capabilities found in the Argus Optical Mapping System.   OpGen, Inc. has developed a unique and powerful Optical Mapping Technology that rapidly generates high resolution, ordered, whole genome restriction maps from single DNA molecules extracted from bacteria, yeast or fungi. Optical Maps are generated de novo, independent of sequence information, and provide a comprehensive view of the entire genomic architecture.  The device provides a new means to compare microbial genomes to identify regions of similarity and dissimilarity across the whole genome.   This vendor has further demonstrated the ability of the device to handle complex or mixed samples of bacteria, and correctly identify them in such circumstances.  This Optical Mapping method is a proprietary technology and is unique in that it employs a process of stretching and immobilizing high molecular weight DNA across a linear surface.  Proprietary software then assembles the fragments to form a consensus Optical Map of the entire genome. No other technology generates high resolution, ordered, whole genome restriction maps of this type. The technology is protected by a number of OPGEN owned patents making this the only vendor that can provide these services.   The suitability and company owned intellectual properties make this vendor the only one able to fulfill the needed of the AF mission-related project.   <br><br><br>

<p>UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW - READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095 <br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>(e) Questions concerning payments:</p>
<p>(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.</p>
<p>(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number or invoice number to inquire about the payment.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Support Ankle. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is April 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization</strong> <strong>Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <br /><br /></strong></span><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172109 or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172106</strong>.</p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Support Ankle. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $979,236.34. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, ninety-three (93) of the total one hundred seventy-three (173) line items represent the top seven (7) products and accounts for 82.76% ($810,499.74) of the total volume in sales ($979,236.34) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO RFIAQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The ten (10) requirements below must be answered and all supporting documentation provided with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong></span>1.

The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately thirteen (13) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: <br />1. NAICS 339113-Patient Comfort - Product is lightweight. The ankle support must be lightweight in order to provide patient comfort due to the duration the device may need to be applied.<br />2. NAICS 339113-Proper Fit and Patient Safety - The product has adjustable securement devices. The ankle support must have securement devices that allow for proper fit and reduced migration resistance to stabilize the injured or diseased lower extremity body part.<br />3. NAICS 339113-Patient Comfort - Product has features to provide comfort and stability to the injured/diseased body part. The ankle support must have padding that contours to the injured or diseased lower body part providing support and stabilization necessary for healing.</p>
<p>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

<DESC>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries. This research is parsed among three Offices: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe &amp; Secure Operations. This BAA solicits proposals for the Office of Safe and Secure Operations.
<p><br />Information technology has qualitatively changed and continues to transform the intelligence enterprise. BAA 10-07 solicits research to enhance mission performance while assuring the security of information at rest and in motion. Examples include:</p>
<p>&bull; Computational methods based on architectures other than digital Turing machines whose attributes are matched to efficient or secure solution of intelligence problems. (e.g. optical, analog, biological, brain-based, quantum, or hybrid computing systems.)</p>
<p>&bull; New approaches to secure transmission of information using optical, electromagnetic, digital packet, chemical, or biological signals. This includes synchronous and asynchronous communications, bandwidth-constrained digital transmission, and triage of large data flows.</p>
<p>&bull; Detection, classification, and mitigation of attempts by adversaries to manipulate electronic data or networked infrastructure.</p>
<p>&bull; Resiliency: approaches to operating securely with imperfect equipment and a compromised network.</p>
<p>&bull; Research to elucidate new approaches to low-energy, low-latency, high-density cryogenic memory as an enabler for superconducting logic as described in IARPA RFI-11-01 (<a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/rfi_eecm.html">http://www.iarpa.gov/rfi_eecm.html</a>). Proposals should include as many of the following goals as is practical: 1) demonstration of basic memory element at cryogenic temperatures; 2) determination of memory element read/write energies and time; 3) understanding of how memory elements will fit into possible memory hierarchies; 4) plan for controller, with estimates of energy per read/write and latency; 5) system model for use as a main memory, cache, or register, to enable trade-off evaluation; and 6) pilot controller/decoder design and demonstration.</p>
<p>Ideas that substantially enhance the safety or security with which information is collected, stored, analyzed, and disseminated are also encouraged, even if they do not explicitly involve information technology.</p>
<p>This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations.

This research is parsed among three Offices: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe &amp; Secure Operations. This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Incisive Analysis (IA).
<p><br />IA focuses on maximizing insights from the massive, disparate, unreliable and dynamic data that are - or could be - available to analysts, in a timely manner. We are pursuing new sources of information from existing and novel data, and developing innovative techniques that can be utilized in the processes of analysis. IA programs are in diverse technical disciplines, but have common features: (a) Create technologies that can earn the trust of the analyst user by providing the reasoning for results; (b) Address data uncertainty and provenance explicitly.</p>
<p>The following topics are of interest to IA:</p>
<p>&bull; Understanding how knowledge and ideas are transmitted and change within groups, organizations, and cultures<br /><br />&bull; Analysis of social, cultural, and linguistic data</p>
<p>&bull; Multidisciplinary approaches to assessing linguistic data sets</p>
<p>&bull; Methods for measuring and improving human judgment and human reasoning</p>
<p>&bull; Extraction and representation of the information in non-technical structured documents, including legal and regulatory<br /><br />&bull; Extraction and representation of the information in the non-textual contents of documents, including figures, diagrams, and tables<br /><br />&bull; Understanding and managing massive, dynamic data</p>
<p>&bull; Effective analysis of massive, unreliable, and diverse data<br /><br />&bull; Assessing relevancy of new data</p>
<p>&bull; Processing noisy audio and speech</p>
<p>&bull; Top-down models of visual perception and visual cognition</p>

MARCH 12, 2010 VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
APPENDIX C
C-1
VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR
INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

1. GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and
National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other
than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the
degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised
(made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
 (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating
the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been
compromised.

9. TRAINING

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
(2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
(3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
(4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.

c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

MARCH 12, 2010 VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
APPENDIX D

CONTRACTOR RULES OF BEHAVIOR

This User Agreement contains rights and authorizations regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This User Agreement covers my access to all VA data whether electronic or hard copy ("Data"), VA information systems and resources ("Systems"), and VA sites ("Sites"). This User Agreement
incorporates Rules of Behavior for using VA, and other information systems and resources under the contract.

1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER
THE CONTRACT:

a. I understand and agree that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in accessing or using any VA, or other Federal Government information systems.

b. I consent to reviews and actions by the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) staff designated and authorized by the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and to the VA OIG regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. These actions may include monitoring, recording, copying, inspecting, restricting access, blocking,
tracking, and disclosing to all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel as directed by the VA CIO without my prior consent or notification.

c. I consent to reviews and actions by authorized VA systems administrators and Information Security Officers solely for protection of the VA infrastructure, including, but not limited to monitoring, recording, auditing, inspecting, investigating, restricting access, blocking, tracking, disclosing to authorized personnel, or any other authorized actions by all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel.

d. I understand and accept that unauthorized attempts or acts to access, upload, change, or delete information on Federal Government systems; modify Federal government systems; deny access to Federal government systems; accrue resources for unauthorized use on Federal government systems; or otherwise misuse Federal government systems or resources are prohibited.

e. I understand that such unauthorized attempts or acts are subject to action that may result in criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. This includes penalties for violations of Federal laws including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) and 18 U.S.C. 2701 (unlawful access to stored communications).

f. I agree that OI&T staff, in the course of obtaining access to information or systems on my behalf for performance under the contract, may provide information about me including, but not limited to, appropriate unique personal identifiers such as date of birth and social security number to other system administrators, Information Security Officers (ISOs), or other authorized staff without further notifying me or obtaining additional written or verbal permission from me.

g. I understand I must comply with VA's security and data privacy directives and handbooks. I understand that copies of those directives and handbooks can be obtained from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COTR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for
resolution. 
h. I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COTR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.


2. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR

a. Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.

b. The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
(1) Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
(2) Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
(3) I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract. If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
(4) Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
(5) Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COTR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
(6) Contractors' use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
(7) Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
(8) Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
(9) Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.
(10) Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
(11) Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders.
(12) Ensure that the COTR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
(13) Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COTR.
(14) Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COTR.
(15) Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
(16) Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COTR.
(17) Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
(18) Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.

3. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
RESOURCES

a. When required to complete work under the contract, I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible. If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA approved remote access software and services.

b. Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.

c. I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COTR.

d. I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.

4. STATEMENT ON LITIGATION

This User Agreement does not and should not be relied upon to create any other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law, by a party to litigation with the United States Government.

5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE

I acknowledge receipt of this User Agreement. I understand and accept all terms and conditions of this User Agreement, and I will comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement and any additional VA warning banners, directives, handbooks, notices, or directions regarding access to or use of information systems or information.

Each proposal submitted will be reviewed before it is evaluated to confirm that the offer meets the pre-qualification criteria set forth above. If the offer does not meet the pre-qualification criteria by the time and date the proposals are due, the offeror could be disqualified. If the offeror meets the pre-qualification criteria, then the technical proposal will be evaluated on the basis of the evaluation factors listed below. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance with their relative evaluation values. Offerors will be ranked according to their scores to determine the competitive range of the most highly rated proposals, with the highest score representing the most highly technically qualified offeror. Business/price proposals of the offerors within the competitive range will then be evaluated to determine the offeror's responsibility and to determine if their proposed prices are realistic and reasonable. The Government may evaluate the price proposals without discussions, except for clarifications. Therefore, the offeror's initial price proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint.
<p>Proposals shall be submitted in two separate volumes/files: 1. A Technical Proposal which content and arrangement shall be as described in the provision entitles, "Instruction for Preparing the Technical Proposal". This will also address the source selection evaluation factors and 2. A Price Proposal which shall be prepared in detail on a basis as described and set forth in the provision entitled, "Instruction for Preparing the Price Proposal". Instructions for Preparing Technical Proposal: a) The technical proposal shall effectively demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW), Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and demonstrate the offerors ability to meet the project requirements and provide the deliverables described in the work statement.(b) Technical proposal should be practical, legible, clear and coherent. General statements that the offeror can comply with the requirements will not, by themselves, be adequate. Failure to provide the technical information requested may be reason for rejection of the offer. To permit objective evaluation of the technical proposal no cost or price information shall be included in the Technical Proposal. (c) Technical proposals shall also address at a minimum, the Best Value Source Selection Evaluation Factors as follows:<br />Factor 1: Experience in federal financial audit deficiency remediation. 40% This factor evaluates the Offeror's experience in resolving Federal financial audit deficiencies and its approach to this Statement of Work (SOW). The evaluation will consider the Offeror's explanation of audit remediation work performed and its demonstrated success of such efforts, including explanations of how its work contributed to or resolved the Federal entity's material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, control deficiencies, etc. This factor evaluates the Offeror's project management capabilities and its approach to resolve NRCS' audit identified issues: undelivered orders, revenue and unfilled customer orders, accruals, financial reporting, property, plant and equipment, general access and application controls and purchase and fleet card transactions. Additionally, this factor evaluates the Offeror's knowledge and experience surrounding implementing and enhancing agency A-123 programs. This factor evaluates the Offeror's knowledge of the legal and regulatory rules governing federal grants, agreements, and contracting processes. The evaluation will rate the contractor's previous experience in these areas and in applying the relevant rules and regulations. This factor evaluates the contractor's knowledge of Federal accounting standards (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and its experience in applying GAAP to ensure proper, compliant business processes. <br />Factor 2: Experience in developing and implementing standardized business practices. 30% <br />This factor evaluates the contractor's experience in developing and implementing efficient, cost effective standardized business processes that are compliant with Federal GAAP, statutes, rules and regulations. The evaluation will include a review of the contractor's previous experience in developing and implementing efficient standard business practices. Specific experience developing standardized business practices in a de-centralized environment will also be evaluated. <br />Factor 3: Staffing plan, mix, and expertise. 20% <br />This factor evaluates the proposed staffing plan, ensuring that proposed personnel are adequate to complete the job within the given timelines and proposed labor mix to accomplish the SOW. The review will consider the qualifications and experience of the individuals proposed and the likelihood that the contractor has or can provide necessary staffing levels. The evaluation will also consider the contractor's staffing strategy to address the audit remediation work in a cost efficient, effective manner.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Past Performance. 10%<br />This factor evaluates the Offeror's past performance which includes the offeror's demonstrated record of performance on recent/relevant efforts. Current contracts or subcontracts completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years from the issuance of solicitation will be considered RECENT. Contracts of similar size and complexity and have a logical connection with the work being acquired are considered RELEVANT. Relevant contracts represent much of the scope of the effort for a Government agency valued between $5M - $8M. Relevant contracts include providing strategies, quality control plans, monthly status reports and training.<br />Please complete the attached Contractor's Qualification and Financial Information Sheet.<br />Instruction for Preparing Price Proposal: (a) A lump sum shall be submitted by line item by each offeror for the required services.

(b) Offerors are hereby notified that even if other cost or pricing data are not initially requested in this solicitation, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request such data if it is later found necessary. (c) Travel for specified contract locations will be at the rate in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations. (d) Wages must be in accordance with the FAR 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees : This provision requires that offerors submit for evaluation a total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating unrealistically low professional employees compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award. (e) Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed to show an inherent lack of technical competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements. This may be grounds for the rejection of the proposal. (e) Task orders will be issued for this contract. (f) Place of Performance: USDA/National Resources Conservation Services, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 532490 Other Commercial Machinery and Equipment Industrial Rental and Leasing.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-54 (Effective on 02 NOV 2011).

DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) order; Contract Line Item No.(CLIN) 0001 is for the rental of one (1) low pressure air compressor (LPAC) for the period of performance 12/19/2011  01/17/2012 for the USS SAN FRANCISCO (SSN-711).

DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Item shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.

52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(i)	  Technical capability of the item quoted to meet the Government requirement
(ii)	  Customer responsiveness
(iii)	  Price

Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award.  Customer responsiveness will be assessed based on past dealings between the quoter and the customer - Naval Submarine Base Point Loma.  If the quoter has never dealt with this customer before, they will be considered to have adequate customer responsiveness for award purposes.
  Alternate customers apart from Naval Submarine Base Point Loma will not be surveyed to make a customer responsiveness determination.  The lowest priced quote that is determined to be technically acceptable and submitted by a company with acceptable customer responsiveness shall be selected for award.

(b) Options (not applicable).
 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 

(d) Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the item required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to W31P4Q-12-T-0038 is to provide answers to the following questions that were submitted:<br><br>Question 12:  In regards to the Virtual Servers and Dedicated Servers Security, what DoD regulations/policies/standards should the AGS adhere to?<br><br>Answer 12:  Required perimeter security services for service provider:<br> - Manageable Network Firewall <br> - Distributed Denial of Service Detection and Prevention <br> - Virtual Private Network (VPN) accessible<br><br>Question 13: Would the contractor be performing the physical to virtual<br>conversions in the current environment?<br><br>Answer 13:  Not sure what this means....there is no current environment.  This is a new requirement.  The government expects the cloud and dedicated servers to be set up and running on the provider's existing service network for AGS to use, therefore all physical to virtual conversions would have been done by the provider.<br><br>Question 14:  In regards to Backup Services for the Virtual and Dedicated Servers, what level of details are needed for the backup requirements as stated in the SOO?<br><br>Answer 14:  There is additional backup information included in the synopsis change dated Dec. 01 2011 11:41 am.  The provider's quote should show the government how they plan to address the 4 bullets listed under the backup services for both dedicated and cloud servers to ensure the government that the provider can meet this requirement.  The detailed plan for backup services can be provided 30 days after award. <br><br>Question 15:  What specific metrics does AGS need to have monitored?<br><br>Answer 15:  Currently, the only metrics that the provider would need to provide is basic network statistics or metrics, for example: connectivity, number of active connections, cpu and hardware utilization, memory utilization.  These metrics should include the incoming and outgoing bandwidth use for both the dedicated servers and cloud servers.  This should also include any bandwidth use "internal" to the network, for instance dedicated to cloud and vice versa.  The government would like to have the right to modify the metrics reported during the life of the contract if needed by AGS.<br>

<DESC><p>The following are questions from potential offerors and the Governments response:</p>
<p><br />1. Is the label size actually 3.75 web x 3.5? Not sure if your sizes<br />below include the liner or not. the liner and gap or is that the actual size<br />of the label? Is there a gap in between them or are they butt cut? <br /><br />Response: The labels are butt cut; the size stated is the size of the liner and the label: 3.75 web x 3.5. The edges of the labels should be rounded.</p>
<p>2. If you have been buying these labels already can you say if they<br />come with a black mark on them for sensing?</p>
<p>Response: There is not a black mark on the labels for sensing</p>
<p><br />3. Also, we can flood coat a direct thermal, but normally we recommend a<br />screen to protect the life of the printhead, however there would be a plate<br />charge for the screen. Again, if you are already buying these do you know if<br />they have a screen to protect the printhead?</p>
<p>Response: The requirement did not specifically mention a screen on the labels. Based on the samples we used and tested, there was no mention of a screen. Flood coat was a requirement of the RFQ. If Floodcoat is not compatible with a screen then it is not a part of the requirement.</p>
<p><br />4. It would be helpful if you can send a picture or actual samples of<br />the labels as well.</p>
<p>Response: I do not have a picture of the labels as we were only provided a limited amount of them and we have used them for testing.</p>
<p>5. Can we send some sample for your evaluation?</p>
<p>Response: The Government will request samples as needed. Please do not send samples unless requested.</p>
<p><br />6. What is the actual size of label?</p>
<p>Response: 3.75 web x 3.5</p>
<p>7. What is the application of label?</p>
<p>Response: The Government uses the labels to identify property in a warehouse setting as well as an outdoor setting<br /><br />8. Are they for interior or exterior application?</p>
<p>Response: They are put on the exterior of packages/property; the packages/property can be stored outside in rain, snow, cold and heat. The labels must be weather resistant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9. Temperature sensitive? This is regarding the environment which the labels will be used.</p>
<p>Response: The packages/property can be stored outside in rain, snow, cold and heat. The labels must be weather resistant.</p>
<p><br />10. What type of Adhesive on the label?</p>
<p>Response: GB720 is the adhesive that should be used</p>
<p>11. Is there a gap between each label or are the labels butt cut? (Answered in last email)</p>
<p>Response: The labels are required to be butt cut</p>
<p>12. Are there any timing marks on the liner?</p>
<p>Response: There are not timing marks on the liners.</p>
<p>13. Are the labels round corner rectangle or square cut?</p>
<p>Response: Corners should be rounded</p>
<p>14. How many rolls are packed in one box?</p>
<p>Response: Rolls per box is not a concern.</p>
<p>15. There are 100s of different shades of yellow, what specific PMS number is associate with the yellow you are requesting? (We have used PMS106 for other bar code labels).</p>
<p>Response: Pantone 012C</p>
<p>16. The core is .75 inches. Are there any other slits or notches in the core?</p>
<p>Response: No, there aren't any other notches in the core, it is solid</p>
<p>17 Would it be possible to mail me a used roll with 2 or 3 labels still attached to the roll?</p>
<p>Response: Sample rolls were used in previous testing, none are available.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 0005<br /><br />The following questions have been sent by prospective offerors and the Government's responses are below:<br /><br />1. Size stated is 3.75 web X 3.5: At one point it says the 3.75 web<br />includes the exposed liner on each side of the label. At another point it says the actual label size is 3.75. We assume that the 3.75 web includes the standard liner size of 1/8" which would make the label 3.5" X 3.5" with a<br />1/16 inch liner showing on each side of the label. Is this correct?</p>
<p>Response: Yes, that is correct. The line is exposed on each side of the label, the measurement exposed is 1/16th of an inch. <br /><br />2. It is stated that the label MUST be butt cut which means there is<br />no gap in between the labels. It is also stated that there is no black mark on the liner. The printer senses the start of a new label by a gap or black mark on the liner. If the labels were manufactured with a butt cut (no gap) and without a black mark on the liner, the printer would have no way of sensing the start and stop of a label. OR are you sensing based on an entry of the top of form in your printing format? Are you able to print without a black bar or a gap between labels?</p>
<p>Response: The printing is formatted within the application. A perforation is required on the label, the printer may sense the perforation as its stop and start point.</p>
<p>3. A direct thermal label is specified. Direct thermal labels would<br />never be recommended for outdoor applications as they will have a short shelf life.</p>
<p>Response: The printer that we are using requires a Direct Thermal Label, we will manage the shelf life issue as needed.</p>
<p>4. Since you have a spec number for the adhesive, do you have a<br />material spec number for the face stock?</p>
<p>Response: The face stock must be Direct Thermal paper, I do not have a Spec Number for the stock.</p>
<p><br />5. If your labels are butt cut (meaning there is no gap between the labels) you would require the need of a timing mark on the back of the liner so the printer would know when to advance the label. If there is an industry standard of 1/8" between each there is no need for a timing mark or notch, so please advise when you can.</p>
<p>Response: The printing is formatted within the application. A perforation is required on the label, the printer may sense the perforation as its stop and start point.<br /><br />6. Additionally, you have called out for a certain adhesive GB720. Is there a reason for this one adhesive in particular? We had quoted on a very good all-temp adhesive with high initial tact and that is able to withstand a very cold environment. What is the environment that your labels are being subjected to? Furthermore, are you receptive to an alternative adhesive that should always be tested before any order is placed from anyone.</p>
<p>Response: The adhesive that we identified is the adhesive that have proven to work in extreme heat (up to 140 degrees) and cold (below Zero). This is the requirement for any adhesive proposed. Environment the labels are subjected to are inside and outside storage in High Temperature (Arizona, New Mexico), High Humidity (Florida), Cold and extreme cold Temperature (Minnesota, North Dakota).<br /><br />Timeframe for asking question is now over please respond by Tuesday 11 Oct 2011, 4:30 PM Eastern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the questions that were received in response to this posting.
Questions and Answers for UV Detector RFQ
1) Please confirm if the instrument requires a standard 19-inch rack frame/enclosure or 23-inch one. 
The instrument must be able to fit in a 19 inch rack. It does not require standard 19 inch rack mounts.
2) Can you provide any other detailed information about the external blower systems to be developed by EPA ORD? For example, dimensions, flow rate, interface, etc.
The design of the external blower is a function of the instrument cell volume. The volume must be completely exchanged in between sampling events. There are significant design and final cost advantages for a smaller cell vs a larger cell. The instrument has to interface with a 10m long sample line, size to be determined by flow rate and pressure drop requirements. 

3) If the instrument has a built-in pump for active air sampling, is it acceptable? If so, what is the preferred sampling flow rate? 
An internal pump is not required.
4) What is the expected time for need or delivery, if there is one?
No later than March 1, 2012
5) How many units would potentially be needed for this purchase order? Any information for future units needed would be helpful too.
One unit is anticipated. No additional units are planned.
6) What is the anticipated budget range for this PO?
The EPA is unable to provide this information.
7) What is the payment term? Would the total price or cost for the PO be paid before delivery, after delivery, or several scheduled payments?
Payment will be made Net 30 after successful delivery and acceptance.
8) Please advise if any further specifications/manufacturer part numbers are available for the items being requested in order to quote for the exact product required.
No additional information is available.
9) Is there a specific format required for the technical submission?
No
10) Please advise if any further specifications / manufacturer part numbers are available for items requested in subject solicitation in order to quote for the exact product required. 
No additional information is available.

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default</p>

<DESC>The mission of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is to conduct and support research on many of the most serious diseases affecting public health. The institute supports much of the clinical research on the diseases of internal medicine and related subspecialty fields, as well as many basic science disciplines. Among these diseases are end-stage liver diseases. To understand the pathophysiology of these diseases, it is essential to provide researchers with access to liver tissue and cells from a variety of end-stage liver diseases, as well as normal livers. These specimens would not be available to researchers who work outside a liver transplant center.<br /><br />The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) requires an organization to provide the infrastructure for procurement and distribution of liver tissues and cells from a variety of end-stage liver diseases and normal livers to basic scientific investigators. The requirement seeks to facilitate the distribution of discarded liver tissue to qualified investigators to stimulate research on liver diseases. Recipients of cells and tissue from diseased livers are primarily investigators whose projects have been vetted by the NIDDK grant process. Available supplies of isolated hepatocytes from normal liver currently dictate that these are provided only to investigators at the National Institutes of Health.
<p><br />The scope of the program is comprised of procuring, isolating, purifying, preserving and distributing donor liver tissue, as well as reporting on this process. Donor tissue shall include whole or sectioned human liver tissue that is normal or shows pathology from a variety of liver diseases. This tissue shall be processed into liver tissue blocks (frozen, paraffin embedded,), hepatocytes suitable for cellular and molecular studies, and other preparations.</p>
<p>To facilitate progress in liver research, to respond to the need of the investigators and to assess the evolution of the services, the contractor shall obtain periodic input from the scientific community regarding the provision of other liver specimens, particularly non-parenchyma cells.</p>
<p>The requirement shall consist of the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Clinical tasks, focused primarily on procuring donor tissue in a clinical setting. Specifically, the requirement shall include obtaining informed consent of organ donors; building a synopsis of donor's medical history and laboratory data; collecting whole or partial livers; and delivering this to a biotech laboratory for further processing.</p>
<p>2. Technical tasks, focused primarily on the isolating, purifying, and preserving the liver tissue in a biotech laboratory setting. The primary objective for tissues prepared with cryopreservation or histology techniques is a preparation that clearly preserves characteristic structures and pathology. The primary objective for cells is to maintain a high rate of cell viability.</p>
<p>3. Order Management tasks, focusing primarily on distributing the tissue to basic investigators. The primary objective is to deliver specimens in excellent condition; process financial accounting information; and track the production process. The system shall receive user requests; review and prioritize requests; maintain a fee schedule; receive and process payments; and communicate with investigators via a website; and support activities of a Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p>4. Reporting tasks, focusing primarily on collecting, analyzing and reporting data on the tasks described above. Specifically, data shall be presented on demographics, metrics, quality control, cost information, inventories, transaction activity and benefits of the program, such as the citations of publications resulting from this service. These data shall be analyzed and presented in graphic form. The requirement includes the ability to customize data queries, export query results to spreadsheet applications and graphically summarize and print query results. This task shall support the Coordinating Committee's strategic decision-making by providing the following types of information: review of operating procedures, quality control procedures, tissue processing procedures, information storage and management procedures, and operating policies ensuring equitable access to contract services.</p>
<p>A cost-reimbursement type contract using NAICS code 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), is contemplated. NLM intends to award a contract consisting of a base award and four option years on or about July 29, 2012. FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to compete this procurement with full and open competition. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals will be released on or about December 21, 2011 at the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br /><br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br /><br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies may provide government points of contact to corrobate information provided on each sub-system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE<br />The following is an outline for a response to this RFI. Please provide the following per subsystem response. This outline will minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Section 1 Technological Capability <br />Identify technological capability related to the subsystem addressed. Identify open architecture, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, software and methodologies employed for signal and antenna pattern development. Identify target processors, operating systems and development environments. Identify any proprietary aspects. Identify interface standards used.

<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>

<p>334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)</p>
<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>
<p>3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>

NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>
<p>Companies may provide government points of contact to corrobate information provided on each sub-system.</p>
<p>4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.</p>
<p>5. SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE<br />The following is an outline for a response to this RFI. Please provide the following per subsystem response. This outline will minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.</p>
<p>Section 1 Technological Capability <br />Identify technological capability related to the subsystem addressed. Identify open architecture, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, software and methodologies employed for signal and antenna pattern development. Identify target processors, operating systems and development environments. Identify any proprietary aspects. Identify interface standards used. Identify Built-In-Test (BIT) capability and calibration techniques.</p>

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.</p>

<p>3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):</p>
<p>a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz.</p>
<p>b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS.</p>
<p>c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.</p>
<p>d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The four subsystems described are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as <br />JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.</p>
<p>b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.</p>

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments.

It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time.

<SUBJECT>RFI - Acquisition Reporting Tool-Amend 4
<SOLNBR>RFI-ACQ-RPT-TOOL-04-15-2011
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<CONTACT>Sheryl D. Sanders, Phone 2024823401, Email ssanders@doc.gov
<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 The date responses are due is amended to read "NOT LATER THAN Tuesday, May 10, 2011, 12:00 p.m. (EDT)" The deadline for questions related to this RFI are due not later than May 6, 2011, 12:00 (EDT) (Added). This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial market for potential Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions to improve the current acquisition reporting tools utilized by the Department of Commerce. Contracting Office Address: U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) Commerce Acquisition Systems Division (CASD) 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Suite 6060 Washington, DC 20230 This is not a solicitation for proposals Request for Information for a Acquisition Reporting Tool THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY &ndash; Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government. All response and response contents to this RFI will be considered information only and will not be binding on the parties. Contractors responding to this request will not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the costs provided as a result of this request are &ldquo;best&rdquo; estimates only. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. The U.S. Department of Commerce is seeking sources, product capability information and pricing information to support a business case and budget for a new acquisition reporting tool/solution. The focus of this RFI is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends. In its current state, the acquisition reporting system is cumbersome and time consuming. Data must be pulled from various disparate systems in order to respond to diverse, mandated reporting requests. The acquisition data for the Department of Commerce currently resides in the following systems: Existing DoC Data Stores Used for Reporting Data # Name Description Owner Database 1 C.Request Census Requisition data DoC/Census Oracle 2 C.Request NOAA Requisition data DoC/NOAA Oracle 3 C.Request NIST Requisition data DoC/NIST Oracle 4 C.Request OS Requisition data DoC/OS Oracle 5 C.Buy Census Contract data DoC/Census Oracle 6 C.Buy NOAA Contract data DoC/NOAA Oracle 7 C.Buy NIST Contract data DoC/NIST Oracle 8 C.Buy OS Contract data DoC/OS Oracle 9 FIDO/FAAPS DoC Acquisition Planning data GSA MS SQL Server 10 CFS Census Financial data DoC/Census Oracle 11 CFS NOAA Financial data DoC/NOAA Oracle 12 CFS NIST Financial data DoC/NIST Oracle 13 CFS OS Financial data DoC/OS Oracle 14 Momentum PTO Acquisition/Financial data DoC/PTO Oracle 15 FPDS-NG DoC Contract Summary data GSA Oracle 16 CCR DoC Vendor data GSA Oracle 17 Bank Card NOAA Bankcard System DoC/NOAA Oracle NOTE: Some DoC systems allow for cross-service functionality. Specifically, NOAA, NIST and OS perform acquisition and financial services for other internal DoC bureaus and for each other. Therefore, a bureau&rsquo;s acquisition or financial data may contain cross-serviced bureau data too. Many of the systems used by Commerce do not provide a robust data collection and reporting environment which necessitates the need for a more efficient reporting tool/solution. Further, several systems are separate and provide further challenges regarding consolidating and collection data from all DoC bureaus. For example, there are four production instances of C.Buy deployed at Commerce one each for: the Office of the Secretary (OS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Census Bureau. The DOT Enterprise Services Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma hosts acquisition data for Census, OS, and NOAA. DOT provides each bureau with their own environment that includes a separate instance of the C.Buy application and Oracle database. Although also using C.Buy, NIST operates and maintains a separate instance at their Gaithersburg, MD offices. Collectively, this means that C.Buy is currently located physically at two locations, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Gaithersburg, Maryland. In addition, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) employs the Momentum finance and procurement system . The majority of DoC utilizes Oracle-based financial systems. These systems provide commitment, obligation and payment data. The Commerce Business Solutions (CBS) Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland maintains the department&rsquo;s Core Financial System (CFS). This system exchanges financial data with the requisition and contract systems. The PTO employs Momentum as their financial and procurement system. Momentum is XML based on their application layer and SQL on their database layer (it does support Oracle). NTIS has a financial system called Budget, Accounting, and Purchasing System (BAPS) and is Government-owned, off-the-shelf software. Like all other government agencies, DoC is required to integrate and exchange certain acquisition data with components of the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE). At a minimum, the reporting tool/solution should be able to query and receive data from FedBizOpps, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Federal Procurement Data System &ndash; Next Generation (FPDS-NG). While each bureau's data is currently stored in disparate databases, DoC would like to utilize a single reporting tool solution for collecting, consolidating and reporting data. The overall objective is to expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency at the Department of Commerce for acquisition and financial data with one reporting tool for all data. The long-term objective is to include other types of &lsquo;business&rsquo; data (i.e., property, human resource, etc.) The various systems at DoC continue to evolve. It is anticipated that in December 2011, DoC will migrate the current acquisition system (C.Buy) with a new acquisition system called C.Award. This is also an Oracle based contract writing system that is more tightly coupled and highly integrated with the current DoC requisition system (C.Request). Therefore, our acquisition reporting tool must be easily configurable to meet the ever changing system needs of the department. Overall Goal Expand and improve the quality and timeliness of reporting efficiency with one reporting tool Objectives: 1.Transform from a reactive acquisition reporting environment to a proactive acquisition reporting environment; a transactional environment to an analytical environment 2.Provide quick start-up, ease-of-use, reduce need for intensive &amp; repeated user training 3.Easily configurable to meet changing data systems 4.Achieve reporting interface with (NOAA, OS, Census, NIST, PTO) planning, requisition, contract, IAE, and financial systems 5.Measure and track acquisition results and savings 6.Utilize mature, best of breed products 7.Compliant with all federal legislation and mandates High Level Functional Requirements 1.Utilize current data warehouse technology and reporting tools. 2.Support Interactive Queries.

Do you offer an acquisition system data warehouse as a service instead of, or as well as, a product? 14.If you have a GSA schedule, please provide the contract number. 15.What hosting portfolio of solutions for cloud computing and virtualization does your company provide? Pricing Information Request: INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide pricing information (in thousands of dollars) for each activity by fiscal year. Pricing data should be provided over the 5 year lifecycle and the out-years should reflect inflation factors as determined by your pricing model. Budget planning is for the system implementation to begin in FY 2011 and be complete by FY 2011. While costs in FY 2011 may include both non-recurring and recurring costs, it is anticipated that FY 2012 and beyond will be only steady state recurring operation and maintenance costs. For budget planning we distinguish between non-recurring costs to deploy the system (Implementation Activities) and recurring year-to year costs which represent Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Activities. You will see some elements such as training in both acquisition and in operations and maintenance. In this case, training in the acquisition phase is to train the initial workforce on new software, while in the operations and maintenance phase, the concentration is training of new features and hires. It is important to keep the concept of segregating recurring from non-recurring costs. Some O&amp;M activities are not performed annually, such as certification and accreditation (a as tri-annual federal requirement) or hardware refresh on a three to five year cycle (depending on your own estimate). While these are not annual activities, they are considered recurring costs to be reflected in the O&amp;M section because they are not associated directly with deploying the system as opposed to maintaining the system. Specific pricing information for activities will be considered a rough order of magnitude and should be based on experience with other similar projects and understanding. It would be most helpful to include estimates along with quality remarks that you would deem to be beneficial in understanding your estimates. These should be provided in a narrative separate from the spreadsheet in a separate MS Word or Adobe Acrobat document. Following are the descriptions for the price elements to be completed in the spreadsheet. Where reference are made to additional requested comments, please do not put these in the spreadsheet, but include them in a separate narrative in a Microsoft Word 2003 (or earlier version) or Adobe Acrobat document. Implementation Activities: Hardware may include the following: - Cost associated with new hardware such as servers and networking equipment needed to utilize the new acquisition reporting tool. Software may include the following: - The cost associated with purchasing the recommended software tool meaning either the license or base fee for a subscription-based pricing structure. - The cost associated with any underlying software that would support the new software tool (e.g. Oracle). Services may include the following: - Preparing, developing or acquiring the information you will use to design and implement the system. - Developing process flow diagrams, data dictionaries, engineering and design studies, and prototypes. - Identifying necessary process changes and data standardization efforts that need to occur. - Installation and testing of newly acquired software.

<DESC>Womack Army Medical Center Vascular Surgery Service is seeking to establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for endovascular devices (see listing below), to include but not limited to balloons, stents, catheters, atherectomy devices and embolic protection devices from multiple companies. The purpose of these BPAs (with their associated consignment agreements) will allow the manufacturers to have a limited stock of devices present in the Cath Lab and Interventional Radiology Supply for use on patients without the need to purchase large quantities of the devices. The Vascular Surgery Service seeks BPAs with consignment agreements with the following companies, each with devices that are unique in their properties: ev3, Gore Medical and Abbott Laboratories. The intent is to have a comprehensive supply of endovascular devices that are available for use at the discretion of the operating surgeon based on the patient's unique procedural needs. As the products are utilized, the items used will be recorded and purchased from the manufacturer using the Vascular Surgery Service's credit card account. The individual company representatives will be responsible for delivering the initial stock of products and devices, conducting regular inventory of product, rotating stock and working with the Vascular Surgery Service nurse for all purchasing issues. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses via email ONLY to George W.

<AWARDEE>Reno-Sparks Convention-Visitors Authority, 4001 S Virginia St. Ste G, Reno, NV 89502 US
<DESC>The only convention center large enough to house a competition of this magnitude in Reno, Nevada is the Reno Sparks Convention Center and Authority.
<p>The Metal and Nonmetal National Mine Rescue Competition was first held in 1973 at Las Vegas, Nevada. The state of Nevada was originally chosen because of its central location relative to the metal and nonmetal mining community. The event was moved to Reno, Nevada in 2002 because the Las Vegas Visitor's Bureau increased the fees of their convention center several hundred percent, thereby pricing their facilities far beyond the Mine Safety and Health Administration's budget. Consequently, other cities were researched considering factors such as location, availability of accommodating convention floor space, hospitality rates, airfare, other travel expenses and government per diem rates. The research concluded that the City of Reno and the Reno/Sparks Convention Visitor Authority's (RSCVA) convention center proved to be the best value.</p>
<p>Extensive outreach to the nation's metal and nonmetal mine rescue community ensued for nearly a year in order to ensure the community that the new location could comfortably accommodate the event. The outreach came at substantial expense to the government.</p>
<p>In 2010, as has been standard practice of the event planning committee, this venue was compared with other cities in the western United States. Once again, the city of Reno and the RSCVA convention center proved to be the best value when compared to the cities of Denver, Colorado and Dallas, Texas.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, West Palm Beach VA Medical Center (WPB VAMC).

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This action is to establish a temporary Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor Lakeside Health Center nursing home to provide nursing home services to two VA patients that reside in Lakeside Health Center. This Basic Ordering Agreement will be established for six months as a firm fixed price with an economic price adjustment.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

a)	The WPB VAMC provide care to two veterans whose primary residence is Lakeside Health Center ,the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a policy that nursing home care may be provided in licensed nursing facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) expense. 

b)	The VA Community Nursing Home (CNH) Program is designed to assist Veterans and their families in making the transition from an episode of hospital care, nursing home care, or domiciliary care to the community. The primary goal of the CNH Program is to maintain or restore the Veteran to the highest level of health and well-being attainable. 

c)	The CNH Program has two cornerstones: some level of patient choice in choosing a nursing home in close proximity to their home and family; and an approach to local oversight of CNHs consisting of annual reviews and monthly patient visits. Following this approach, the West Palm Beach VA has established contracts in various areas throughout Southeastern Florida. 

d)	The Contractor is to provide nursing home care in accordance with the VHA Community Nursing Home Procedures specified in VHA Handbook 1143.2. The facility has to meet all state licensing requirements including the state requirement pertaining to level of medical liability insurance.

e)	Payment to the CNH is subject to the State Medicaid rates which change semi-annually; however, our agreement allows only an annual change to reduce administration.

f)	The estimated value of the agreement over six months, January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012 is $98,930.37. 


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Lakeside Health Center is the primary residence for two WPB VAMC Veterans. This facility was chosen by the veterans as it is in close proximity to their home, family and friends, these Veterans have adapted to the facility and its staff; these Veterans and family have become accustomed to the daily routine provided by Lakeside Health Center and any change could jeopardize their health. The primary goal of the WPB VAMC is to maintain or restore the Veterans to the highest level well-being, while assisting Veterans and their families in making the transition from an episode nursing home care to the community, therefore changing facilities at this time is not in the best interest to the Veterans. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This action is to establish a temporary Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor Lakeside Health Center, this agreement is established to allow the WPB VAMC time to execute a five year multiple award Basic Ordering Agreement.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The pricing for this acquisition will be based on the established current Medicaid rate for the State of Florida.  Based on the guidance given in M5 Part II chapter 3, a conversion from Medicare RUGs to Medicaid rates is used.  The WPB VAMC uses Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.  A negotiated percentage to the SMA Rate will be given and remain constant throughout the life of the agreement, in accordance with the Economic Price Adjustment Clause of the contract rates may fluctuate.  The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable as Medicaid rates for nursing home care is standardized categorized by geographical location and levels of care.


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was performed finding there are several businesses in the same area as Lakeside Health Center that provide nursing home care.  Market research for future agreements is dependent on the needs of the patients and resources of the VA Medical Center which is customarily administer d by Social Work service. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Lakeside Health Center is the primary residence for two WPB VAMC Veterans, this nursing home is in close proximity to their home, family and friends; these Veterans have adapted to the facility and its staff; and have become accustomed to the daily routine provided by Lakeside Health Center.  Change in care could jeopardize the health of these Veterans; therefore changing facilities at this time is not in the best interest to the Veterans. 


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  No other nursing homes located in the same proximity as Lakeside Health Center have expressed interest in establishing a contract with the WPB VAMC.  However, any nursing home that expresses interest in contracting with the WPB VAMC shall be evaluated and considered for a contract, based on the WPB VAMC geographical need, specific care needs, and quality of care.
 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  All future procurements will be posted through the Government point of entry. Any potential source who expresses interest in providing these services may be considered.  Proposed action is for six months.
