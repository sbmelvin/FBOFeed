<DESC>Description: ?Support to the organizational phase of the Center for Petroleum Asset Risk                       Management (CPARM)? DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to The University of Texas at Austin, Center for Petroleum Asset Risk Management (CPARM)? to increase capital efficiency while reducing risk in hydrocarbon exploration and production  as stated below.                                                          Statement of Work        ?Support to the organizational phase of the Center for Petroleum Asset Risk Management               (CPARM)? APPROACH The overall goal of the CPARM is to increase capital efficiency while reducing risk in hydrocarbon exploration and production.  The CPARM is a unique public-private partnership sponsored by exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies, R&D organizations, and government agencies, with the University of Texas at Austin as the managing partner. OBJECTIVES Three units of the University have come together to create the Center; the geoscience, engineering and business units.  The program elements include:  - basic methods in the decision and risk analysis,  - development of tools such as software, databases and model,  - design and testing of workflow,  - organization processes and change management, and  - awareness and skill development through a variety of gatherings The CPARM will bring the participating partners together to review the research proposed and determine the priorities for funding.   This followed by the actual research management and transfer of the results to the appropriate stakeholders. STATEMENT OF WORK The scope of activities under this contract is defined below. 1.  Provide access and membership to the Management Committee  The DOE/NETL will have a respresentative presence on the CPARM Management Committee and participate in discussions and decisions on the development and management of the organization.  The DOE will recuse itself from voting on decisions regarding the selection and funding of research project carried out by the Center 2.  First Year Progress Report and Presentation  A detailed report of the progress during the funding year will be prepared and presented to DOE/NETL at a DOE location.   The report will contain both the organizing efforts and the resulting research. PROJECT DELIVERABLES The following items are the deliverables associated with the project. 1.  Provide access and membership to the Management Committee 2. First Year Progress Report and Presentation This purchase order is being issued to the CPARM because they are uniquely qualified to perform this work since they have a unique public-private partnership sponsored by exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies, R&D organizations, and government agencies, with the University of Texas at Austin as the managing partner.  Real asset risk management technology is the synthesis of subsurface and aboveground uncertainty characterization, risk and decision analysis, real options valuation and value of information estimation, and portfolio optimization with the skills, organizational workflow and processes needed to yield decisions that create value and minimize risk. Real asset risk management technology holds substantial promise to improve the performance of the petroleum exploration and production industry, with potentially vase benefits to the U.S. economy and the public.  Risk management is, however, an immature science, one for which market forces discourage the needed research and development by individual private firms.  The CPARM of the University of Texas at Austin is a public-private partnership established specifically to overcome these market barriers. This request is considered to be sole source to The University of Texas at Austin, Center for Petroleum Asset Risk Management.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Ms. Rhonda Lindsey 918-699-2019.

<SUBJECT>B--IDENTIFICATION OF NAVY TECHNOLOGIES TRANSFERABLE TO THE OFFSHORE ENERGY INDUSTRY
<SOLNBR>DE-RQ26-03NT30751

<DESC>Description: Identification of Navy Technologies Transferable to the Offshore Energy Industry. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to the Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC), The Woodlands, TX to identify to the industry applicable Navy technology for high value - high quality and low cost as stated below:                                                      Statement of Work        ?Identification of Navy Technologies Transferable to the Offshore Energy Industry? STATEMENT OF WORK - APPROACH The overall goal of the project is to identify to the industry applicable Navy technology for high value - high quality and low cost. The specific objective is to identify currently available Navy technologies related to the offshore energy industry. Recognizing that there are numerous technologies that could be included, the project will be limited to an initial effort to catalog technologies. After performing the initial cataloging, a workshop will be held with industry representatives to solicit comments and direction for expanding the catalog. In order to accomplish the above, the following approach will be taken. 1.  Identify NAVSEA-Carderock Technologies/Develop Initial, Preliminary Catalog   Applicable NAVSEA-Carderock technologies that may impact the supply of domestic oil and gas will be identified. The offshore industry?s most pressing technological needs have never been mapped against the immense inventory of available U.S.  Navy technologies. The portion of the Navy?s technology inventory that is most closely aligned with the offshore energy industry resides at the Navy?s Carderock Laboratory facility, known as NAVSEA-Carderock, in West Bethesda, Maryland.  A preliminary catalog of a selection of NAVSEA-Carderock technologies will be developed. NAVSEA-Carderock has patented over six hundred inventions since 1980. Beyond these patents the technical body of knowledge at NAVSEA-Carderock includes numerous working prototypes, full-scale field applications and system technology demonstrations. This entire body of knowledge needs to be organized into categories that relate directly to the offshore industry?s existing needs. The project will result in a catalog that can be used to demonstrate to the industry the possibilities available from NAVSEA-Carderock. This catalog will then be discussed with the industry to determine further work required.  As previously discussed, the Navy has developed considerable expertise that is applicable to the offshore and maritime industry. For example the Navy?s experience in materials (to withstand pressure, temperature, and corrosion typical in marine environments), subsea communications, acoustics, ships? hull design, propulsion, seals and valves have direct application. 2. Conduct Public Forum  The NAVSEA-Carderock Division will host a Technology Forum to discuss the preliminary catalog and to create an awareness of technologies, facilities, expertise and patents available at Carderock. Carderock will present its special capabilities and experience and how it may impact on offshore industry future. The Forum will underscore Carderock?s commitment to dual-use programs and to transition its knowledge and facilities to offshore energy industry.  At the Forum, Carderock will present briefings and posters.  Attendees will have a chance to network with the presenters and tour specific facilities. The forum may be a part of a broader effort by the federal government to create an awareness of technologies available in the Federal labs and expanding partnerships with business. 3. Develop Final Report PROJECT DELIVERABLES The following items are the deliverables associated with the project. 1.  Document that consists of a preliminary catalog of selected NAVSEA-Carderock developed technology. Only selected technologies will be included in the catalog. Different indexes for assessing the Navy?s technology will be devised to determine the readiness of technology for transfer to the offshore industry. 2.  Plan for Public Peer Review/Forum at NAVSEA-Carderock Facility 3.  Meeting proceedings including documented issues where NAVSEA-Carderock technologies have been showcased. 4.  Project briefings to DOE staff. 5.  Draft Final Report. This report will be based primarily upon lessons-learned from this project. The report will detail for the Department of Energy opportunities to expand, or modify, its working relationship with the performing organizations. In addition, the report will detail any joint industry projects that develop as a result of this effort. This purchase order is being issued to the HARC because they are uniquely qualified to perform this work since they have an existing agreement and working relationship with the U.S. Navy? Naval Sea Systems Command-Carderock (NAVSE-Carderock) through a Memoranda of Understanding and a CRADA entitled, ?Sustainable Deep Ocean Systems? (NCRADA-NSECCA-01-050).  HARC has broad experience in working with industry, government and academia in establishing and managing consortia.  HARC?s ability to provide the forum for government-to-industry networking and fostering the marketing of lab technologies, supported by their success in documenting case studies and ability to offer technology transfer opportunities is crucial to the success of this project. This request is considered to be sole source to the Houston Advanced Research Center, The Woodlands, TX.  Therefore, no solicitation will result for this announcement.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.

Within CAMCODA, the Human Development Unit (HDU) focuses on national and international research addressing health and developmental consequences and conditions associated with drug abuse in fetal, infant, child, and youth (pre-adolescent, adolescent, and young adult) populations.  The CAMCODA human development program is also involved in collaborative planning and implementation of child and adolescent research on topics that cut across CAMCODA program areas and those of other NIDA Divisions and Offices.  Mr. Salandry will perform preparation of research newsletters, assistance with planning and implementation of the upcoming scientific conference, and performance of analyses for the development of new research priorities.  The period of performance will begin in September 2003, and end in September, 2004.  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, and Size Standard is 500.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC, has a requirement for Glass, Quartz and Teflon filters.  The quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler. The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM 2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution.  It is important that all filters of the same type from the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run.  EPA anticipates the award(s) of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity/Firm-Fixed Price/Performance Based contract(s) with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty months.   The Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts under this solicitation; one (1) for each of the three filter types (glass, quartz and teflon) as a result of this single solicitation.  Any one offeror may receive up to three (3) awards as a result of this solicitation -- one award for each filter type.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation No. Q5340030510 is issued as a Request for Request for Quote (RFQ) and will be awarded as a firm-fixed price Order for Commercial Items, using simplified acquisition procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541720; the size standard is $5.0 million.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15. The solicitation items are as follows: The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA) has proposed to reduce fuels along the wildland - urban interface.  This action is needed to reduce the risks of damage to structures and improve the ability of firefighters to safely fight wildland fires.  Much of the boundary areas of CRNRA are in contact with urban areas.  We propose to target specific areas as top priority for fuels reduction. The CRNRA encompasses 48 miles of the Chattahoochee River in northeast Georgia and was established by Congress in 1978.  The Chattahoochee River Corridor has been heavily occupied for thousands of years. Cultural sites from many prehistoric periods have been found in the area of the Chattahoochee River Corridor. The river was a border between Cherokee and Creek Indian Nations and between Cherokee and United States Territory.  Border towns, home sites, and other sites have been found. Mills used the river and its tributaries for power up until the early 1900s. Many were burned during Sherman's March on Atlanta and rebuilt after the Civil War.  Undisturbed prehistoric and historic archeological sites found on the CRNRA are of sufficient interest and quality to be considered eligible for the National Register. The "Cultural Resources Overview and Predictive Model for the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, Cobb, Forsyth, Fulton, and Gwinnett Counties, Georgia" (2001) indicates that new archaeological sites are continuously found during detailed archeological surveys in the environs of the Chattahoochee River.   The rich cultural history of the Chattahoochee River Corridor needs to be preserved for future generations. We are proposing to reduce fuels and create defensible areas in boundary areas that have not had detailed archeological surveys. These studies will need to be completed prior to implementation of any proposed ground disturbing activities.  General Statement of Work The work of this project includes the detailed archaeological survey of specified boundary areas. These areas are listed below.  The surveys will include visual surveys to verify the locations of previously known sites and detect other possible archeological sites. National Park Service policies on archeological sites will be followed. Visual surveys and physical testing should be conducted in areas that have not previously been surveyed in detail.  An evaluation of the site and exact location of sites not previously documented will be included in a report. The discovery of any previously unknown sites will be recorded so that CRNRA can report the findings to SEAC and SHPO. Drawings of the any new sites, locations of physical testing, specification of the type and age of the new sites, artifacts found on the surface and during physical testing and any other pertinent information will be included in the report. A final report documenting the cultural resources in these areas both on CD and hardcopy will be given to the CRNRA two weeks after completion of the surveys.  Special Contract Conditions/Considerations National Park Service Management Policies affirm a long-term commitment to the appropriate investigation, documentation, preservation, interpretation, and protection of archeological resources inside units of the National Park System. All of the archeological resources in CRNRA are subject to the care and management required by laws, regulations, policies, Director's Orders and guidelines described and referred in NPS Director's Order 28b: Archeology.  If human remains are found during physical testing, all testing in the area should stop and the proper authorities should be notified. Care should be taken to minimize subsequent damage to the site. Proper authorities include but are not limited to Park Superintendent, County or City Coroner, and Head of Cultural Resources Southeast Regional Office National Park Service. If a significant cultural site is found the attached form must be filled out and attached to the final report. Evaluation of any undocumented site as to whether it has yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history should be made. If a site extends out of the survey area on the CRNRA side, the extent of the site should be determined Any artifacts found during shovel testing will be documented and returned to the ground. Any artifacts found during surveys should have exact location determined.  Association with a nearby site and other pertinent information will be provided along with the artifact to Kevin Cheri, Park Superintendent for proper care and deposition. The areas under consideration for thinning of trees and shrubs are generally overgrown with vegetation. Dense vegetation including kudzu and blackberries can make passage difficult.  Since CRNRA prefers to discourage the public from creating new trails, care should be taken to minimize permanent damage to vegetation in the area of trails where possible.  It is important that while conducting archeological surveys that surveyors be responsive to park visitors and neighbors. However, specific information on location of sites is considered sensitive information.   The areas proposed for initial fuels reduction include Cochran Shoals northwest boundary, McGinnis Ferry north boundary near McGinnis Ferry Road, Gold Branch west boundary, Bowman's Island north border, and Johnson Ferry North near historical Washburn Lodge.  The proposed areas of fuels reduction are as indicted on the attached spreadsheets.  Maps of the areas will be provided before survey work is done.  The following FAR provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.2211-06 Brand Name or Equal  FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-03 Offeror Representations And Certifications - Commercial Items FAR 52.212-04, Contract Terms and Conditions-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-05, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities FAR 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, FAR 52.225-11 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases FAR 52.232-34 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor Registration FAR Clause 52.212-2, "Evaluation Commercial Items" applies to this solicitation and the following criteria evaluation criteria (arranged in their order of importance) shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Past Performance (2) Technical capability to meet the Government Requirement and (3) Price.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-15. The NAIC code is 541330 and the small business size standard for this procurement is $4 million. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1. This notice is being issued as a Request for Offer (RFO) for: Item 1) Engineering Services for Two-dimensional simulation studies of wide-bandgap heterojunction devices (SiC and GaN). The Contractor shall furnish Engineering Services for Two-dimensional simulation studies of wide-bandgap heterojunction devices (SiC and GaN) in accordance with the following specifications.  Item 1: Engineering Services for Two-dimensional simulation studies of wide-bandgap heterojunction devices (SiC and GaN) NASA-GRC has been working in the field of wide-bandgap semiconductor devices for future high frequency, high power devices.  Numerical simulation is essential for guidance in design, and corroboration of measurements in the lab.  NASA has been using the software package from SILVACO DATA SYSTEMS, INC., and requires its use to perform this effort.   The contractor shall perform the tasks listed below.  Required input data for Silvaco ATLAS and MOCASIM simulations will be provided by NASA Glenn. Tasks:	 1.   Predict static I-V curves for 3C/4H SiC diodes.  The doping, trap state density, soft breakdown, and lifetimes are the design parameters.  After reasonable design, the switching speed as a function of parameters and temperature will be determined.	2.   Generate I-V characteristics of GaN/4H-SiC and GaN/6H-SiC diodes and transistors, and correlate these with published results in the literature (Pankove, et al). This means a parametric study of gain, stability, as functions of leakage with temperatures up to 500 degrees C.  3.   Develop static I-V characteristics for a DHBJT consisting of GaN/3C/4H-SiC.  Initial epi-doping, layer thicknesses, and metallization layout will be provided by GRC.  Once the static relations appear desirable, the contractor shall develop [S] parameters over the 8-10 GHz band at 100 MHz steps.	 4.    Determine temperature profiles of AlGaN/GaN/SiC HEMTs, designed for operation in the 32-36 GHz band.  This requires a 3-Dimensional analysis with the subroutine GIGA.  The gate widths, lengths, and source-drain separations will be varied, along with the number of gates, to determine optimum designs for minimal self-heating.  Once the layout is determined, calculation of [S], and [Y]-parameters over this band as a function of channel temperature is needed.  The contractor shall determine the MAG, MSG, and absolute value of the output/input hybrid current gain parameter with frequency.	The contractor shall determine both the cut-off frequency and maximum frequency of oscillation for all design geometries. The contractor shall generate graphs, plots, and charts to facilitate display of the results.  The contractor shall interact with the NASA Glenn technical point of contact three (3) days a week.  The interaction shall occur at NASA GRC, as necessary, with the NASA technical point of contact guiding the Contractor’s performance.	 The deliverables will be: 1. Determine S-parameters ( in the .5 to 35 GHz range )  for NASA specified Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN ) semiconductor electronic devices at temperatures ranging from -5 to 600 degrees Celsius. 2. Imbed the above devices into the mixed-mode Silvaco Data Systems simulator to determine complete circuit responses.  This includes transient and steady-state cases. 3. Provide Smith Chart plots for display of power gain and stability circles. 4. Use the routines GIGA and FASTBLAZE to determine temperature profiles for a specified bias, and power gain condition. 5. Provide Tony-plots of device geometry with charge distributions, electric fields, and current densities. The Period of Performance for the effort is 3 months.  (Anticipate a start date of 9/22/03 or 9/29/03.)  The Level of Effort shall be not more than 360 hours.  The Contractor is required to perform the effort at NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio 3 days a week during those 3 months.  The Contractor shall be a US Citizen or permanent resident.  The Government will furnish a Farnsworth workstation, the software tools, and sufficient furniture/supplies necessary to perform the effort. The Contractor shall perform the required services Monday-Friday, non-federal holidays, during normal business hours at NASA GRC (typically 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.).  Actual workdays and hours will be those directed by the NASA Technical Point of Contact. Completion and delivery to NASA Glenn Research Center is required within 90 days.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by September 12, 2003, 4:30p.m. GRC local time and may be mailed to NASA Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Road, MS 500-306, Cleveland, OH  44135, and include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), Cage Code, taxpayer identification number (TIN) and other Representations and Certifications (52.212-3), identification of any special commercial terms, description of items offered per 52.212-1 and as modified, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The National Cancer Insitute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Pouplations Sciences (DCCPS), Cancer Statistics Branch (CSB), Surveillance Research Program (SRB), plans to procure through the basis of sole source from Artificial Intelligence in Medicine , Inc., 2 Berkeley Street, Suite 403, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5A 2W3 SEER Electronic Pathology Software.  The SEER Program of the National Cancer Insitute is an authoritative source of information on cancer incidence and survival in the United States, which began on January 1, 1973.  The SEER Program currently collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from 11 population-based cancer registries and three supplemental registries covering approximately 14 percent of the US Population.  Included in these SEER registries are more than 3 million in situ and invasive cancer cases and approximately 170,000 new cases are accessioned each year.  About 95% of cancer are diagnosed by pathology and as a result, cancer registries rely heavily on pathology reports to identify new cases and key characteristics of the cancer required for its classification.  Historically, pathology data gathering has been performed manually whereas the use of electronic pathology will allow SEER's registries to automate a major source of case finding with the accompanying increases in data completeness, timeliness and quality.  Referred to "Electronic Pathology" or E-Path, the software to accomplish such automation would require the following capabilities: 1) Pre-existing pathology reports, consisting of both text-based and coded portions of the overall report, must be searched in order to select the potential cancer cases.  2) Selected cases are then transmitted from the pathology laboratory in the registry.  This must include complete tracking and an audit trail.  The transmission system must be secure and conform to all HIPAA requirements, and 3) the informaton must be easily incorporated into the registry's data management operation. Artificial Intelligence In Medicine, Inc., (AIM) is the sole source provider of this software and is proprietary to AIM.  AIM is the only known source to the NCI that has the technology developed to automate the review of pathology reports for cancer case finding and the dissemination of those that are required by a cancer registry.  The contract period will consist of one (1) base year and four (4) additional option years.  FAR clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract and 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services are included by reference.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must bein writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researchers to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M., EDT (local Washington, D.C. time, on September 12, 2003.  This requirement is being procured under FAR Part 2, and is being processed in accordance with the test program under simplifeid procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. All questions should be directed to Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on(301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 541511.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute( NCI), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB), plans on entering into a sole source contract with the University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, Department of Biostatistics, Ann Arbor MI 48109. The SRAB conducts and supports statistical research, modeling, and collaboration related to the cancer surveillance and cancer control missions of the NCI.  Essential corollaries to the development of cancer surveillance databases and cancer control interventions are the statistical analyses and mathematical modeling that contribute insight into the interpretation of these data.  Research within SRAB is targeted at improving and developing statistical methods and models for use in the analysis and presentation of population-based cancer statistics, as well as in the broader areas of cancer surveillance and cancer control research.  SRAB promotes and faciliteates the use of these methods at NCI, other federal agencies, as well as throughout the extramural research commmunity.  Currently there is no single survey that can provide direct estimates of the prevalence of cancer risk factors for small area such as counties.  One strategy is to combine information from multiple surveys for this purpose.   Previous contracts (263-MQ-116962 and 263-MQ-311439) developed computer code and made small area estimates for the period 1997-2000 using data from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)for a number of outcomes of interest to cancer surveillance researchers including the following: 1) smoking (current and lifetime) and 2) cancer screening examinations (pap smear, mammography, sigmoidoscopy, and blood stool).  Monitoring these estiimates is consistent with meeting the objectives of Healthy People 2010, which includes objectives for smoking and cancer screening.  These estimates form a means of measuring health disparities, and the reduciton of health disparities is a major goal of NCI, NIH, and the DHHS.  The computer code that will be used as a starting point for this contract was developed by a graduate student of the University of Michigan.  In this proposed project the NCI DCCPS computer contractor, IMS, will take over computer code development and build on the computer code that created the NHIS/BRFSS combined estimates by adding additional codes that will address the shortfalls herein.  The University of Michigan is the only source known to the NCI that has access to this computer code development.  However, if any interested parties believes it can provide this requirement, it may submit  a statement of capabilities.  The satement of capabilities must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M. EDT on September 17, 2003.  This acquisition is in accordance with FAR 13 to use simplified acquisition procedures.  The NAICS Code is 541990.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the electrical, natural gas, water and wastewater infrastructure systems at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, New York. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, New York. System Descriptions: Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater. The station occupies approximately 985 acres on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant. The station has expanded several times and currently has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial type buildings). In addition, the station has Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing. The electrical distribution system is supplied power by Niagara-Mohawk Power Corporation by two separate feeds. The 914th Airlift Wing is supplied by a 13.2 kV electrical line that enters the base on the north side. The 107th Air Refueling wing is supplied by a 13.2 kV electrical supply line that enters the base on the west side. Each Air Wing has its own electrical distribution system, but they are connected by a switch that is locked in the open position. The electrical distribution system for the 914th portion of the base consists of approximately 24,400 feet of new overhead primary line and 2200 feet of overhead secondary line. The electrical distribution system for the 107th portion of the base consists of approximately 5,100 linear feet of underground primary line and 500 feet of underground secondary line. Pole mounted and pad mounted transformers of various sizes are used throughout the system. The electrical system supports approximately 130 outside area lights. The water distribution system is supplied by the City of Niagara Falls, New York. Water is distributed throughout the base in approximately 48,300 linear feet of cast iron, transite, and PVC water mains. Sizes range up to 10 inches in diameter. A pump station, located approximately one-quarter mile south of the southeast corner of the base boosts pressure. The water system also includes approximately 88 fire hydrants. The town of Wheatfield provides an emergency water source to the water system through a clay valve that releases if pressure in the base system drops to an unacceptable level. The natural gas distribution system is supplied by National Fuel Gas Company at two locations. Natural Gas for the 914th Air Wing is fed by a line that enters on the north side of the base. Natural gas for the 107th Air Refueling Wing is fed from the west side of the base. Approximately 25,000 feet of steel and plastic pipe make up the gas distribution system for the 914th Air Wing. Approximately 6,800 linear feet of steel and plastic line make up the natural gas distribution system. The wastewater collection system is discharged to the Niagara County Sewage District No.1 sewer system east of the base. The Niagara Falls wastewater collection system includes approximately 36,600 linear feet of pipe (ductile iron, reinforced concrete and PVC). Sizes range from 4 inch to 12 inch. The wastewater collection system is a combination of gravity flow and forced main and includes 3 pump stations.  See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), plan to procure on a sole source basis services for the implementation of a Quitline Consortium from the Center for Tobacco Cessation (CTC), American Cancer Society, 901 E Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC  20004.   In November 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) published the national health objectives related to tobacco use, covering tobacco use in population groups, cessation and treatment, exposure to secondhand smoke, and social and environmental changes. In addition, Healthy People 2010 has identified that reducing tobacco use is one of the 10 Leading Health Indicators for the nation with a goal to improve the health of the U.S. population by reducing cigarette smoking by adults from 24 percent to 12 percent by 2010. Cessation efforts are an important part of a comprehensive approach to tobacco control and it is critical to help smokers quit. The National Action Plan for Tobacco Cessation, prepared by the Subcommittee on Cessation of the DHHS Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health (ICSH), recommended establishment of a federally funded National Tobacco Quitlines network (quitline consortium) by FY 2005.  Such a quitline consortium will provide universal access to evidence-based counseling and medications for tobacco cessation and a national portal to available state or regionally managed quitlines. CTC shall work with NCI and collaborating agencies and organizations to develop a plan that implements the ICSH Cessation Subcommittee’s recommendations related to tobacco cessation telephone counseling and accomplishes the recommendations set forth from the North American Conference of Smoking Cessation Quitlines. These recommendations include:  1) Promote formation of a consortium, develop a mission statement and clear expectations, and establish an administrative infrastructure; 2) Develop minimum data sets and guidelines for evaluation; 3) Develop strategies for communication and information sharing; 4) Improve public and policy awareness of quitlines’ efficacy at local and national levels; 5) Establish benchmarks and standards; and 6) Build research capacity.  CTC is a leader in implementation of a quitline consortium and is the best source of available science on cessation, effective tobacco dependence treatments and activities. CTC has received grants from leading organizations, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and will be able to perform the work in the most effective and efficient manner as a result of its existing infrastructure and solid relationships with the organizations and individuals involved in the blueprints and quitlines consortium efforts. CTC has in place the operational systems, such as communications vehicles (an electronic newsletter and Web site) and information and contact management systems (databases) that can be used to conduct the work that will be required. In addition, CTC has existing key relationships at the national and state levels and the credibility among these groups that will be necessary to accomplish this work.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 17, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990

<DESC>Description.
NAICS code 541199.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13 "Simplified Acquisition Procedures" (48 CFR Part 13), the United States Department of Commerce is providing widespread notice of this acquisition opportunity and is requesting proposals to provide technical assistance to the Government of Egypt (GOE) to supplement training provided to Egyptian diplomats at the Institute of Diplomatic Studies (IDS) in Cairo, Egypt.  The successful offeror will work with United States Department of Commerce Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), IDS and the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to teach diplomatic attaches how to use electronic commerce (E-commerce) to promote foreign trade and investment in Egypt. Housed in the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), IDS serves as the main mechanism for training both MOFA diplomatic attaches and the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Trade (MOFT) commercial attaches.  The attaches are assigned to Egyptian embassies worldwide and represent Egypt at high profile events, negotiations, and trade missions, relating to foreign and commercial affairs.  Thus, the training offered to newly appointed attaches at IDS offers critical expertise in negotiation skills, business communication skills, inter-agency coordination, E-commerce, and trade mission’s strategies.       

In coordination with the IDS, a CLDP advisor with expertise in the use of E-commerce and information technology will travel to Cairo, Egypt, for two weeks to prepare for and train IDS attaches on how to use these tools to promote foreign investment and trade in Egypt.  The goal of this program is to promote the use of E-commerce and information technology to facilitate trade between foreign and Egyptian companies.  This program will include both lectures and simulation exercises.
 
This contract is for up to fifteen (15) days of work.  The successful offeror will be required to work with U.S. Government and GOE officials for two weeks in Cairo, Egypt. It is anticipated that work in the Country will commence on or about November 28, 2003. 

Evaluation Criteria. The offerors should have the following technical capabilities: 

1. Significant experience (at least 10 years) training public and private sector representatives on the use of E-commerce and information technology for trade and investment; and
2. Significant experience (at least 10 years) working in emerging markets or developing countries.

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors are requested to submit a brief capability statement (not to exceed five (5) pages) which comprehensively addresses each criterion set forth above. Cost and technical proposals are not required and will not be considered at this time. The Government will review and evaluate timely received capability statements and those offerors who meet the Evaluation Criteria will be deemed "qualified". The Government will then furnish each qualified offeror with a draft copy of the Statement of Work, source selection criteria and proposal instructions. The Government may enter into discussions with qualified offeror after receipt of capability statements and after receipt of proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that such discussions are necessary, the Government will notify qualified offeror of the date/time for such discussions. For the sake of clarity, the Government may communicate with qualified offeror at any point during evaluation of the capability statements and proposal evaluation process. The Government also reserves the right to award without discussions at the Contracting Officer’s discretion.   

Contract Type and Period of Performance. The Government anticipates issuing a Purchase Order for a firm-fixed price that will require the contractor to complete the required work within 30days of Purchase Order award. 

Additional Information. Compliance with protocol between the governments of the Country and the United States of America in connection with performance of the Contract will be required.  Qualified offerors will be briefed on the protocols and security requirements. The protocols and security requirements are not available for public dissemination.  Qualified offerors who have been provided with the protocol and security information will be forbidden from disclosing the terms, content and procedures of the protocol and security. Furthermore, while in the County, the selected contractor will be representing the Commercial Law Development Program, the U.S. Department of Commerce and, by extension, the United States Government. The contractor will therefore be required to adhere to all applicable ethics codes in effect in their respective jurisdictions and professions and contractors also must adhere to applicable federal conflict of interest statutes and standards of conduct.

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors must submit two (2) copies of capability statements on or before 09/16/03.  The capability statements must specifically and comprehensively address the Evaluation Criteria and be submitted in writing. The address to which Capability Statements must be addressed and sent is: Cherita Toulson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 6521, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230.  Electronic (e-mail) versions of the Capability Statements must be in Microsoft Word format and sent to Ctoulson@doc.gov. All Capability Statements must be sent to assure receipt by the Government on or before 3:00 p.m. EST, September 16, 2003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Question:  1) Who has been performing the campaign work to date? Response:  The current incumbent is Fleishman-Hillard, Inc. Question:  2) In your criteria, number three (3) asks that we describe the impact of corporate involvement with specific examples of how the impact was measured. We are unable to show behavior modification for some of our most relevant campaign work at this time due to the nature of the issue requiring more long range evaluation (substance abuse, diabetes education, etc.) but we are able to address message awareness. If we focus on message awareness, would that satisfy this criteria? Response:  The criteria we consider relevant are the same criteria the Government has been using to measure the corporate participation component to date: 1) value of in-kind donations from corporations, 2) the number of additional impressions generated by corporations, and 3) the relevance of corporate activities to campaign strategies   We consider corporate participation independent and separate from a paid advertising campaign.  Firms should provide their highest level evidence to demonstrate how their corporate outreach efforts are relevant to this acquisition.  Therefore, the evaluation criteria for this portion of the process remains unchanged."

<DESC>Question:  1)  It doesn't matter, but I assume the Department of Interior is going to manage the contract for the Office of National Drug Control Policies. I know at one time it was HHS and then the Department of Navy or the Federal Industrial Supply Center (FISC). Response:  The Department of the Interior/GovWorks will be the administering contracting office for this effort. Question:  2)  We will send the capabilities statement via email, but how many hard copies of the capabilities statement do you need/want?    Response:  All Offerors must submit an electronic copy  in Microsoft Word plus one (1) original hard copy to the Contracting Officer at the address specified herein.   Email submissions to Terrie.Callahan@mms.gov and Mary.Coleman@mms.gov.  The hard copy must be received by the contracting officer within 5 business days from the due date at 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170.  Please note:  It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission (electronic and/or hard copy) is received by the person specified herein, by the required due date.  Queston;   3)  Please confirm that the bios and cases count toward the 30 pages?  Response: The hard-copy must be not more than 30 pages, and in a font size not smaller than 12.  Therefore, the submission shall not be more than 30 pages in it's entirety. Question:  4)  How many case studies are you looking for?  Five?   Response:  The Government asks that the offerors submit as many examples as they feel relevant to this effort as long as it does not exceed the 30 page limit. Question:  5)  Do you want creative samples, and if so, may we include as an addendum so they will not count against the 30 pages?   Response:  Yes, creative examples can be submitted as an addendum, as long as it does not exceed the 30 page limit. Question:  6)  Is it safe to assume the Key Personnel will be the Project Director and the Project Manager or you thinking that all staff working on the project will be considered Key Personnel.   Response:  The Government anticipates that the Offeror(s) will identify their key personnel based on their solution to the Government's needs and requirements for this effort.  Therefore, it is up to the vendors to make their own assumptions regarding their proposed key personnel.

<DESC>High speed camera specifications are amended as follows:  Specification number 2 is modified to read: Resolution must be at least 512 x 512 pixels at 1000+ fps and resolution at higher frame rates (ea. Ca. 32000 fps) must be sufficient to allow photo analysis with minimum blur with an ability to image individual splash droplets as small as 0.5 mm – 5 mm in diameter. High resolutions at high frame rates are required to get the most accurate measurements.  Higher frame rates give more data points and therefore allow better estimates of droplet velocity and visualization of droplet impact on leaf surfaces.  A sufficient number of images must be taken to allow estimation of speed and size of droplets.  Appropriate frames per second, shutter speed and resolution must provide this capability. Specification 3 is added as follows: Depth of field is an important criterion in a given lighting situation.  The lens and camera should maximize depth of field in a given lighting situation to capture droplets clearly as they move through the plane of view. Remaining specifications are renumbered accordingly.  Due date for receipt of quotes has been extended until 1:00 PM EDT September 9, 2003. All else in this solicitation remains the same

SECTION 1:  SUMMARY/BACKGROUND

The U.S. Commercial Service (CS) maintains approximately 20 databases and this Request for Quotes (RFQ) seeks quotes from contractors who are able to merge these databases into one database that will be used for CS marketing purposes.  After creating one consolidated database, the contractor shall remove duplicates and evergreen the list.  The contractor shall also be called upon to recommend additional contact lists that should be procured to augment the existing consolidated list. 

The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service ("US&FCS" or "Commercial Service"), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), operates over 100 Export Assistance Centers (EACs) domestically, and approximately 175 Commercial Posts in 78 countries overseas. US&FCS is statutorily mandated to promote U.S. exports by providing export promotion and facilitation services, products and programs to small-to-medium-sized U.S. business enterprises (SMEs).  US&FCS Commercial Officers and Specialists in our overseas posts, and Trade Specialists in our EACs in the United States, counsel U.S. firms, offer strategic export planning expertise, assist with trade event participation, and develop and deliver market intelligence and trade data on a cost-recovery fee basis. 

SECTION 2:  SCOPE, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE

This solicitation seeks a contractor to merge approximately 20 databases containing approximately 300,000 records.  The contractor shall merge these files together, append certain fields, and remove all duplicates.  The resulting file shall then be run against the U.S. Postal Service National Change of Address Database and the Commercial Service "Do Not Contact" list.  The contractor shall process the files 4-6 times per year, based on the needs of US&FCS.
The Government will provide the contractor with the necessary files of all databases to be processed on zip disks or CDs, electronic files as listed below and possible additional databases as the contract period progresses:

ATI - 64,001
Exim-37,800 
Water Quality Association (IBP) - 136
AAIW - 201
California Farm Show - 27
CorpTech - 58,685
Housewares (IBP) - 65
International Franchise Exposition - 206
CS Trade Mission - 109
International Catalog Exhibition - 7,850
Natural Products - 54
Pack Expo - 741
SHOPA - 229
TFC Mexico - 69
CNUSA - 288
EPS - 26,660
Louisiana - 563
Marketing - 2,923
TryUS2002-8,152
USA Trade - 5,706

Databases will be provided in Dbase format and each database will contain the following fields:  Source, first name, last name, title, company name, address1, address2, city, state, zip, phone number, fax number, email, web site, woman or minority owned (yes/no), current CS client (yes/no), revenue, number of employees, industry, product description and products used. 

SECTION 3:  Statement of Work:

The Contractor shall:
¢	Combine all databases into one consolidated database 4-6 times per year as determined by the US&FCS COTR.  
¢	Separate fields as needed. For example, "first name" and "last name", and "address1" and "address2."
¢	Remove duplicates from consolidated list.
A duplicate is defined as a record that contains the same last name, company name, AND address as another record.  If no last name exists, a duplicate is defined as the same company name and address.
¢ Remove specific information in certain company records as requested.
¢	Compare the consolidated list against the U.S. Postal Service National Change of Address list to update addresses and other contact information for each record.
¢	Compare the resulting list against the "Do Not Call" list provided by the Commercial Service.  
¢	Identify all fields that have a one-to-many relationship to the organization record, such as "source," "industry," and "country of interest" and list these items in one field using a delimiter.
¢	Use outside sources to append the email field (and possibly the fax field) of records in the resulting CS Master List.
¢	Return the evergreened consolidated list via zip disk or CD Rom to the U.S. Commercial Service in an ASCII comma delimited format. 
¢	Maintain copies of all of our databases, including the "Do Not Contact" list, and be able to provide copies, when requested.
¢	Maintain copy of the resulting CS Master List and be able to add new databases to the existing CS Master List so that the Government will not need to "reclean" the lists each time we run the merging/de-duping program.
¢	Serve as a "list broker" to provide additional company contact information on U.S. exporters to augment our CS Master List.

SECTION 3:  DELIVERY SCHEDULE/DELIVERABLES

The Contractor Shall Deliver:
Approximately four to six times per year: A single, large database that has all duplicate entries removed.  Deliverables shall also include highly researched additional databases of U.S. exporters that meet the criterion that they complement CS's current database.  Deliverable shall be due within 15 working days of receiving all databases from the U.S. Commercial Service.  
When changes are necessary, the contractor shall have ten (10) working days to make necessary changes.

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a solicitation to procure printing, distribution, and processing services for the  2004 Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) Open Season.  The OPM, Center for Retirement and Insurance Services, administers health benefits coverage for an estimated nine (9) million active employees, dependents, and annuitants.  The FEHBP is the world’s largest voluntary employer-sponsored health benefits insurance program and is mandated by the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act to conduct an annual health benefits open season to allow FEHBP participants to make changes to their health plan enrollment and level of coverage.  The statute also requires that the OPM provide health plan information to all employees and eligible annuitants.  The OPM is seeking a cContractor to design and print guides and envelopes, in addition to personalization, distribution and processing of materials related to the annual FEHB Open Season for annuitants.  Using a database of approximately 1.8 million individuals supplied by the OPM, the Contractor prints, personalizes, and mails letters, notices, guides, and other informational materials to annuitants enrolled in the FEHBP.   Subsequently, annuitants may request health benefits enrollment changes, and/or additional information by using, at a minimum Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology or other advanced technologies including the Internet.  The Contractor must then process these requests.  After the initial mailing, the Contractor must mail additional informational packages on a continuing basis, mail notices and enrollment change information to annuitants as well as the 220+ FEHBP plans.  In addition to the printing and mailing of 1.8 million open season packages to actively enrolled annuitants, the Contractor is required to print and mail a separate open season package to annuitants not currently enrolled in the FEHBP but are eligible to reenroll during the open season.  The health benefits enrollment and address changes that result from processing annuitant requests are recorded and sent to OPM through electronic transmissions.  The Contractor must also be able to send this information through electronic transmissions to a centralized enrollment data “hub” and meet the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Regardless of the volume received, the Contractor is required to process all actions within 3 days of receipt and with a high level of accuracy.  Throughout these processes, the Contractor is required to integrate a multifaceted operation, involving multiple phases, in order to perform the numerous and complex edit, and validation routines necessary to assure that the actions taken are appropriate.  Prior to the start of the open season, the contractor must perform a full scale test to validate its data base retrieval system and its automated processing system, which includes: (a) laser printing messages, letters and FEHBP plan information; (b) personalizing individual letters and notices from a Government provided data base; (c) processing open season requests including enrollment and address changes, requests for additional information, generating new individualized letters with printed error messages and/or other special notices, generating summaries of actions including enrollment changes for annuitants, enrollment changes for former spouses, requests for health benefits plan brochures, enrollment confirmation letters, special handling items and submitting those actions to OPM in an automated fashion; (d) generating a series of test reports and electronic transmissions in the format specified by OPM from the processed transactions.  The Contractor may be required, at any time during the open season period and with little notice, to provide additional programming services, design, print, fold, insert, and mail special notices to a large volume of individuals.  The Contractor must grant positive assurance that its electronic data processing systems, can routinely generate the required volume of automated outputs with an immediate turnaround time with the high degree of accuracy required by OPM.  The OPM is interested in knowing what the capability of the small business community is for performing work of this type.  Interested small businesses should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC).  The SOC should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.  Any other specific and pertinent information as it pertains to this particular procurement requirement that would support your SOC and strengthen our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Capability Statements should be submitted to the address above, not later than 3:00 pm, September 19, 2003.  All Capability Statements received after the closing date and not postmarked at least five (5) days prior to the closing date, will be considered late and will not be given consideration. The North American Industry Classification System code for this project is 511140, and the definition of a small business is a firm that has 500 employees or less.

<SUBJECT>A -- AFRL/MNG Request for Information
<DESC>The government is soliciting the submission of whitepapers from commercial sources for the following topics.  The whitepapers should provide a description of the company capabilities in the topic areas.  Limit length of whitepapers to a maximum of 10 pages.  Send whitepapers to Martin Kradlak, AFRL/MNK, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810 or e-mail to martin.kradlak@eglin.af.mil.  For technical questions the POC is Dr. Brian H. Miles, AFRL/MNGS, (850) 882-1724 ext 110, brian.miles@eglin.af.mil

Topic:  The government is soliciting the submission of whitepapers from commercial sources that have demonstrated advanced technology for two color focal plane array (FPA) detector arrays sensitive in the 1-2.3 micron region.  Each detector in the array must provide two distinct current outputs, one for each band of interest.  The two bands will be spectrally separated by at least 50nm.  It is expected that the focal plane will be used to measure two laser wavelengths simultaneously.  For example, the two wavebands might be any (but not limited to) of the following waveband pairings 1.2 /1.8 microns, 1.0 /1.6 microns, or 1.5/2.1 microns.  Individual detector elements in the focal plane array must have bandwidth in excess of 1GHz.  Detector-to-detector spacing or pitch should be on the order of 40-100 microns.  The detector array should have very good sensitivity and the FPA should be capable of providing simultaneous output through a suitably designed readout of all pixels.  Note only detector technology and not readout technology is being sought in this listing.  The focal plane effective fill factor (with or without microlens array) should be in excess of 80%.  It is preferred that each spectral channel of the detector array provide a high degree of isolation (>20dB) from the adjacent detector, but other approaches including detector differencing, while less desirable, may be considered as well.  The detector is expected to be highly sensitive and will not be subjected to high laser fluence.

Topic:  The government is soliciting the submission of whitepapers from commercial sources that have demonstrated advanced product technology in the area of optical micropolarizer arrays or arrays of micropolarizers.  Specifically, the micropolarizers should have high (>100:1) extinction ratio at any wavelength from 1-2.3 microns.  The size of the overall micropolarizer array could reach 1 inch on each side with individual micropolarizers on the order of 50-100 microns square.  The micropolarizers can be etched into the FPA array, bonded to the FPA or suspended above the FPA.  While it is expected that the main interest is in micropolarizers which are linear diattenuators or linear polarizers, sources of combinations of linear micropolarizers and micro-retarder plates are sought as well.  Products are sought that provide minimal cross talk between channels, high overall transmission and low absorption for the “pass” state of polarization.  The micropolarizer array will not be subject to high optical power.

<SUBJECT>79 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  

The Committee has been asked to consider adding for the GSA Multiple Award Schedules the following items:  H2Orange2 (7930-00-NIB-0163 – Ultimate Cleaner/Degreaser); (7930-00-NIB-0326 – Concentrate 117 Cleaner/Degreaser); (7930-00-NIB-0327 – Grout Safe); (7930-00-NIB-0341 – Crystal Carpet Concentrate); (7930-00-NIB-0342 – Quick Spot Crystal Carpet Spot Remover); (7930-00-NIB-0353 – Mineral Shock Cleaner) and Professional LYSOL Brand II Aerosol Disinfectant Spray (6840-00-NIB-0039 – Original Scent); (6840-00-NIB-0040 – Fresh Scent); (6840-00-NIB-0041 – Country Scent); (6840-00-NIB-0042 – Crisp Linen Scent); (6840-00-NIB-0043 – Sprint Waterfall); (6840-00-NIB-0044 – Plus Fabric Refresher).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms.  To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 

For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

(End of clause) STATEMENT OF WORK U.S. Southern Command Human Rights Division STATEMENT OF WORK  (SOW) Secretariat  Human Rights Initiative (HRI) 1.0  Client Organization:  Headquarters, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM),  ATTN:  SCJ5/HR, 3511 NW 91st Avenue, Miami, Florida,  33172 2.0  Project Background:  The nations of Latin America and the Caribbean experienced a turbulent history of widespread gross violations of human rights in the second half of the 20th  century.  Democracy swept the region in the 1990Ã¢Â€Â™s and today every nation but one has a democratically elected leader.  Throughout the region, political and military leaders are working to develop democratic institutions through constitutional, legal, and judicial reforms.  Unfortunately, lack of economic development and continuing high levels of poverty have lead to popular disillusionment with the democratic, free market experiments, presenting a difficult challenge to these fledgling democracies. Currently, many nations in the region are experiencing increasing levels o f political and social unrest, with several already at a critical mass for violent outbursts.  The civilian leaders in a number of these countries are calling upon the military and security forces to assist police forces in maintaining public order without  benefit of commensurate resources and training.  USSOUTHCOM remains committed to supporting Ã¢Â€Âœa community of military and security forces which are committed to democratic values and principles [and] demonstrate respect for human rights.Ã¢Â€Â   To th is end, in 1995, the Command established the Human Rights Division that is currently charged with managing a long-term, pro-active strategy designed to work with regional militaries in fostering a culture of respect for HR within their respective instituti ons. 3.0  Project Focus:  The Human Rights Initiative (HRI) is a major engagement tool for USSOUTHCOM and a key component of the CommandÃ¢Â€Â™s Theater Security Cooperation Plan (TSCP).  Since 1996, USSOUTHCOM has been working with the armed forces of the regio n, civilian governmental and non-governmental organizations and international organizations, as well as academics on the development of a regional Consensus Document whose objective is to create zero tolerance on the part of military and security forces fo r any violations of Human Rights (HR) or International Humanitarian Law (IHL) which its members may commit.  The goals of the Consensus Document are to instill a culture of respect for human rights within the military and security forces and to evaluate th e effectiveness of initiatives designed to establish/enforce HR and IHL standards of conduct.  To this end, the Consensus Document contains common objectives, standards, and measures of effectiveness in the areas of Doctrine, Education and Training, Intern al Control, and Cooperation with Civilian Authorities.  The Consensus Document was approved by the 31 participating nations of the region in March of 2002, marking the end of the Development and Approval Phase (Phase I).  Phase II of the HRI consists of th e implementation of the Consensus Document at the national level in each of the participating nations.  The implementation of the Consensus Document will require the continued and increased involvement of the USSOUTHCOM HR Division, supporting the diverse committed institutions and organizations.  In particular, the participants have requested that the USSOUTHCOM HR Division assume the responsibility of establishing/leading an Executive Committee to coordinate implementation initiatives and a Secretariat to  elaborate projects and strategies and to assist in procuring funds for their execution.   4.0  Statement of Work:  4.1  Needs Assesment:  Research, analyze, and coordinate needs and activities of the military and security forces of the participating nations who are involved in, or choose to become involved in, the HRI, in order to assist in the development of education  and training initiatives which support the implementation of the plans of action contained in the Consensus Document.   4. 2  Procurement of Funds:  Prepare proposals and seek financing for education and training initiatives that  support the implementation of the plans of action contained in the Consensus Document. Provide logistical, technical, and academic support of all th e activities that are financed. 4.3  Administrative Support:  Provide administrative assistance to the HRI Executive Committee and execute and coordinate HRI activities to include seminars, conferences, and other events associated with the implementation of the Consensus Document. 4.4	Dissemination of HRI Information:  Prepare and distribute periodic bulletins on the plans and progress made toward implementation of the Consensus Document. 4.5  Technical Assistance:  Establish and maintain appropriate databases on the diverse technical aspects of implementation in order to establish institutional integrity and continuity of the HRI implementation process.  Provide technical assistance to the  development and maintenance of the HRI Web page.  Prepare didactic, audiovisual, and photographic material that supports the implementation of the Consensus Document and marketing of the HRI. 4.6  Academic Support:  Prepare didactic material for use in training activities.   4.7  Information and Dissemination Strategies:  Develop strategies to approach and inform HR international organizations in order to cultivate support for the implementation of the HRI. 5.0  Performance:  Work is to be accomplished for the USSOUTHCOM HR Division.  Certification by the Government of satisfactory services provided is contingent upon the contractor performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the  contract.  The  HR Division representative(s) and the Secretariat representative(s) will meet at least on a quarterly basis and at least once a month telephonically, to review performance objectives.   6.0   Deliverables:  All deliverables must meet professional standards and meet the requirements set forth in contractual documentation.

The following provisions and/or clauses are incorporated by reference and apply to this RFQ:  

	FAR 52.212-1, “Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (OCT 2000)” is incorporated by reference.
	FAR 52.212-2, “Evaluation – Commercial Items (JAN 1999)” is incorporated in full text as follows:  

52.212-2 - Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
	LISTED IN ORDER OF DESCENDING IMPORTANCE
	1.  Federal Aviation Administration (or Air Transport Canada) 
			certification and compliance
		2.  Facilities to store the aircraft per the Statement of Work.
3.  Past Performance, to include evidence of past performance/
			experience refurbishing/overhauling DeHavilland of
			Canada aircraft; restoration of substantially aging
			Aircraft to full airworthiness; and capability of retrofitting
			(particularly aging) aircraft with COTS components.
		4.  Price/Cost, to include the hourly rate to be established for CLIN 0008.
[Contracting Officer shall insert the significant evaluation factors, such as (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) price; (iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304); (iv) small disadvantaged business participation; and include them in the relative order of importance of the evaluation factors, such as in descending order of importance.] 
The FAA certification (or Canadian equivalent); Facilities; and Past Performance factors, when combined, are of greater importance than price/cost.  Best value will be based on an integrated assessment of all above factors.  NOTE:  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except, clarifications as provided in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price/cost and technical standpoint.  [Contracting Officer state, in accordance with FAR 15.304, the relative importance of all other evaluation factors, when combined, when compared to price.] 

b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, Subpart 13.106 and Subpart 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  This is a full and open competition.  Description of Work to be performed: In December 1999, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) published a Rule establishing a set of eligibility requirements for appraisers seeking placement on the FHA Roster.  The regulation stipulated that, in order to be placed on the FHA Roster of Appraisers, appraisers must be licensed or certified in the state in which they operate and a pass a HUD/FHA examination on appraisal methods and reporting.  Only appraisers listed on the Roster are permitted to provide appraisal services for properties secured by FHA-insured mortgages.  As part of FHA requirements, Single Family Program Development (SFPD) has established and developed (2) examinations.   A national provider will administer the exams and the cost paid by the user. The following are the tests to be administered: 1.) FHA Appraiser Examination certifies appraisers' knowledge of HUD Handbook 4150.2 Valuation Analysis for Home Mortgage Insurance.  This examination is mandatory for placement on the FHA Roster of HUD-approved appraisers; and 2.) The Federal Housing Administration seeks to improve its certification process through a comprehensive examination "Qualifying Examination for 203 (K) Consultants" that will provide an objective measure of the 203 (K) consultant's knowledge and competence.  Passing the examination with a satisfactory score must be achieved before the 203 (K) consultant can receive HUD approval and provide services in that capacity. SFPD has developed examination questions and examination standards for the FHA exams.  HUD/SFPD is soliciting testing companies with the capability to administer the FHA Exams on a national level.  The total cost of the testing fee is to be paid by the examination applicants.  The testing/examination fee to the applicant and capabilities of each provider will be considered in choosing an individual company or companies to administer FHA Exams.  HUD/FHA will deliver examinations to the Contractor and the Contractor shall administer the examinations. The examination format is multiple-choice questions.  HUD must be able to change FHA Exam questions at any time, with a reasonable amount of notice from HUD to the Contractor.  Broad revisions are expected annually.  The Contractor shall be required to submit/transmit the examination results electronically to SFPD on a daily basis.  FHA Exam candidates must be afforded the opportunity to obtain additional copies of Official Score Reports (examination results) for a nominal fee to be determined by the National Test Administrator.  The Contractor shall be able to provide examination results to examinees at conclusion of examination.  The Contractor is not required to incur any unnecessary expense for advertising.  The contractor will provide a list of the test sites, locations, and testing times.  HUD will make this information available, via the HUD web, to any/all persons interested in taking the test.  SFPD is seeking a vendor to be a National Test Administrator (NTA).  The NTA will administer examinations provided by SFPD to applicants.

All fee rates to be charged will remain in effect for each one-year period (from date of contract award for 12 months for base year and each of two one year options).  The estimated number of applicants to be tested annually is between 1000 and 4000.
