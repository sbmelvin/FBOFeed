The demonstration is required for the assessment and clarification of potential engineering issues encountered during the demonstration of a guided parafoil intermediate delivery system for top-attack munitions from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  STARA is an operating small business that has previously developed an existing lightweight GPS-guided parafoil capable of meeting the demonstration requirements.  This agency is utilizing the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Sole source rationale comprises of developmental duplication costs and unacceptable programmatic delays to the Government.  This procurement action is intended to be a four-month Purchase Order.

Office moves may involve moving only a few pieces of furniture or equipment within one building or may involve moving an entire office or suite to another building.  Items to be moved may include, but are not limited to, boxed materials, office equipment, office supplies, furniture, cabinets, shelving units, safes, refrigerators, computer equipment, microwaves, and copying machines.  The services may include a variety of manual tasks involving moving; disassembling, reassembling and assembling of new and used office furnishings; transportation to destination; delivery to designated room(s) at new location; placement inside the room(s) as required and reassembling that which the Contractor disassembled.  In addition, the Contractor may be required to transport surplus Government property to a designated property disposition area.  The Contractor may also be required to support official functions of the Command Affairs Office located at the New Cumberland site, as necessary, by providing labor to set up chairs and stages for ceremonies and meetings.  The Government will provide the chairs and stage equipment to the Contractor.

The Contractor shall comply with all safety and building regulations pertaining to the movement of equipment.  All filing equipment shall be transported upright and all filing cabinet drawers must be taped or otherwise protected against opening.  Contractor personnel shall take particular care when moving computer equipment, typewriters, adding machines, calculators, and other machines of this type.  Contractor personnel shall take every precaution not to damage any equipment.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES SHALL NOT BE MOVED UNDER THIS CONTRACT.

The majority of the work to be done under this contract will be in buildings occupied by Government employees.  Therefore, the Contractor agrees to undertake its best effort to guarantee the work is performed in a way to ensure minimal disruption to the building occupants and agency operation.  For relocation services that require moving an entire office or suite to another building or site, the Contractor may be required to provide any or all of the following:
a.	conduct site visits with customer(s) to inspect sites where services are to be performed.
b.   furnish all packing containers and related supplies including, but not limited to, boxes and cartons, crating material, padding material, marking material, sealing tape and color coded marking tags.

Contract period is anticipated to be from January 20, 2004 through January 19, 2005 with four (4) option year periods.    

It is anticipated that approximately 95% of all work required under this contract will be paid via the Government Purchase Card (Visa credit card).  Therefore, in order to be considered for award, the Contractor must accept the Government Purchase Card as a payment method.  The other work (approximately 5%) may be required by customers who are not authorized to use the Government Purchase Card.  Payment for this other work will generally require the submission of an invoice to the payment office designated on the task order.  Submission of an offer in response to this solicitation represents Contractor’s acceptance of the Government Purchase Card as the major payment method for task order issued under the resultant contract.  Failure to accept the Government Purchase Card as the major payment method will result in rejection of the Contractor’s offer.

Since some payments for work performed under this contract may not be made via the Government Purchase Card and in order to comply with the Debt Improvement Collection Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 
1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas infrastructure system at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility system being privatized is described as follows: Installation: Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. System Description: Natural Gas.  The base size is approximately 4,524,064 square feet, which includes 365 buildings and 874 military family housing units. The natural gas distribution system is supplied to Luke Air Force Base at three separate locations by 175 pound per square inch gauge gas mains owned by Southwest Gas Corporation. The natural gas piping on the main base is almost entirely polyethylene (PE). Steel piping is located in the Military Family Housing area. The piping is coated, rather than wrapped, and includes a cathodic protection system. The system contains 19 rectifiers. There is no physical on-base production of gas or natural gas wells. The meters owned by the Air Force are used for billing purposes. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 119,000 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 20 years old, with some as old as 50 years. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  The cascading source selection method permits small and large businesses to submit offers.  Offers from small businesses will be considered first. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for award to a small business concern are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.

<DESC>Intent to award a sole source, TF04EBP0002.

There would be a negative impact to the mission of the Military Airlift operations, McChord AFB, Washington, if a break in service occurs.  The impact to the government would be egregious.  The current task order was issued against an expired BPA therefore a new task order is authorized with a period of performance of 3-months ending December 30, 2003.  The value of the new order is under $100,000.00.  This sole source is being awarded under FAR part 12. 

This task order is intended to meet the completion requirements of the Military Airlift operation and is an interim solution while a competitive solicitation is conducted.   Per FAR Part 13.106-1 2.b Soliciting From a Single Source “Contracting Officers may solicit from a single source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available”.  Conducting a full and open competition would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the 62nd Operations Squadron requirements (FAR 6.302-1) and would cause unacceptable delays and financial impacts therefore this sole source is intended to facilitate the time needed to put out a competitive solicitation.
  
Any and all questions need to be addressed to the Contracting Officer listed below.  The publisher will not answer questions regarding this posting.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR Design and Fabricate Vacuum Chamber.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers and to extend the response date to 9/23/03. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 9/23/2003. 1. The choice of materials is described as Alu or SS which are supposed to be non-magnetic (2.3). As SS contains substantial amounts of Fe still, it has a residual magnetic property of 1.01 at least. Aluminum is non-magnetic. If that is what they need, the choice of material is going to be Alu. Magnetic properties of 300-series stainless steels are acceptable. Material selection between aluminum and stainless steel should be based on lower weight and structural performance, not non-magnetic properties. 2. We have discussed stiffener ribs while at the same time keeping the weight under 800lbs while at the same time trying to accomodate the fixture holes (2.14). That is difficult to say the least. But we can accomplish all of the above by going to a fairly thick material Alu. The deflection then is about 2 mm in a worst case scenario in the center of any given plane. Please  verify if that is alright with them. Maximum deflection of 0.075 inches (1.9 mm) on all six walls is acceptable. 3. If the chamber needs to be made from Aluminum (as concluded above) we have to use either surface hardened aluminum CF flanges or stainless flanges with aluminum weld-neck. Both are pricey. If non-magnetism is an issue, the all-aluminum flanges should be used. Then however life expectancy of the knife edge is an issue as it rolls-over after 5-10 uses. But as indicated, they are willing to use Viton seals. If they are however, and as we are using lots of O-rings anyhow, the ISO flange standard may be a better choice. These can be made from Alu without a problem while sealing well and repetitively. Cost reductions will amount to a few thousand Dollars. Please advise Magnetic properties of stainless steel CF flanges is not a problem.  All equipment except for the windows have already been purchased with CF flange design, so ISO flange standard is not an option. 4. Just a comment: In drawing "Aft Vac Chamber Wall", there is a DN 50 (3.38") CF flange designated. We advise against using this flange diameter as there are discussions about phasing out this one from the standard. If there is an application tied to that, that may be a different matter. But if there is choice..... The equipment to attach to this specific CF flange has already been purchased in the flange size shown. 5. What bakeout temp do they request for certification ? Bakeout should be performed at 250 degrees F to remove adsorbed water molecules. 6. Is the chamber heated during the process ? What are the operating temps ? The chamber will only be indirectly heated by the process being conducted within it.  The equipment to be installed within the chamber has an operating temperature not to exceed 200 degrees F, so the chamber will not exceed this temperature.	The process will not be run continuously, so internal temperatures are expected to remain well below 200 degrees F on a routine basis. 7. How often do they remove the top cover ? ( We would suggest bolted closure, as they keep the sides "cleaner" in terms of design and generally provide a better seal. They are also allowing us to maximize the opening of the top. ) The top cover will only be removed for permanent installation of the positioning system into the bottom of the chamber, and for any maintenance that cannot be accomplished through the side doors.  A bolted closure for the top is acceptable.  The requirement for a removeable top may be eliminated from the specifications provided that the two side access doors are designed to allow for installation of the positioning system.  The positioning system measures 32.3 inches (in the fore-aft direction on the sketches) by 27.4 inches (in the right-left direction on the sketches) by 21.6 inches in height, and weighs approximately 100 lbs.  The side access doors shall still be hinged and interchangeable. 8. Yesterday, we have talked about the door frames being "outside" of the chamber, in order to maximize the door opening. Today we have stumbled accross the "24 x 24 or better" remark in the word doc (2.7) while at the same time calling for a maximum opening in the top (2.6). My comment yesterday did not take that in account. In this case, the door frames will have to be "internal" and the top cover frame external. See answer to previous question. My engineer has reviewed your specifications and has informed me that the chamber cannot be build to the specifications.  It you design the chamber to the safety factor of 2 based on material yeild strengh that the weight will be more like 2000 lbs. Material selection between aluminum and stainless steel should be based on lower weight and structural performance.  Factors of safety of less than 2 shall be specified. Most chambers designed today are based on a maximum deflection rate of between .050" to .100" in order for the chamber to handle the 14.7 lbs per square inch pressure pushing on the outside of the chamber.  If you do not use enough material to handle this load, then the welds will start to crack over time. This chamber may see a duty cycle of 3 vacuation/repressurizations per day, on average.  The chamber should be designed to avoid weld cracking due to this cyclic pressurization.  Maximum deflection of 0.075 inches (1.9 mm) on all six walls is acceptable. 9. As the chamber is intended to be portable, and as light as possible, but at the same time, minimally deflected under vacuum, we would like to know if the user has a maximum deflection value in mind, and if it is the same for all sides. Maximum deflection of 0.075 inches (1.9 mm) on all six walls is acceptable. 10. A related issue to making it light is stiffeners. Normally, on a box this size, we would not rely on wall thickness for strength, but rather on external stiffening elements (beams). Are there locations (other than at the actual flanges) where such beams would interfere with external equipment? No. 11. Another related issue is the internal support for hardware. These are shown as blind-tapped holes in the inside walls of the chamber, minimally 3/8 or 1/2" deep. This impacts minimum wall thickness, and points toward excessive total weight. We would like to suggest that these mounts be, instead, small, thick plates that are welded to the chamber surfaces. The mounting surfaces would then move inboard by a corresponding amount, which either would or would not be a problem for the user.  Opinion? Small thick plates welded to the chamber surfaces for mounting purposes are acceptable, provided that the plates do not exceed 1 inch in height for the top mounted hardware (wire feeder), and provided that the height of the chamber be adjusted to the thickness of the plates added to the bottom of the chamber (for the positioning system).  The positioning system mounted to the bottom of the chamber drives the height of the chamber, so if that has been raised within the chamber, the distance top of the chamber needs to be compensated accordingly.  The wire feeder at the top of the chamber does not require any compensation for the overall chamber height. 12. The doors. As described, the doors are minimally 24x24, but the viewport locations on the drawings require at least 30 3/4" in one dimension, which amounts to the full dimension of the chamber side. Since both doors are to be interchangeable, the minimum door size is, perhaps, 31x24. This causes some severe structural problems in trying to make a lightweight box, as there is no available flange space unless the door flanges protrude above the top and bottom, or the box itself is somewhat larger.  Then, of course, there is a problem with a full-opening top. If operational access to the chamber can be made exclusively by using the doors, we might propose eliminating the removable top from the spec. In fact, if we knew the maximum dimension of objects and hardware that had to transfer in and out, or be installed, we could propose a significantly different basic design. The requirement for a removeable top may be eliminated from the specifications provided that the two side access doors are designed to allow for installation of the positioning system.  The positioning system measures 32.3 inches (in the fore-aft direction on the sketches) by 27.4 inches (in the right-left direction on the sketches) by 21.6 inches in height, and weighs approximately 100 lbs.  The side access doors shall still be hinged and interchangeable. 13. Weld certification. This is normally not supplied on non-pressure vessels. Leak test data is taken to be sufficient. Can we drop the former? No.  Weld inspection and certification is still required. 14. Non-magnetic construction. Note 2.13 shows concern about magnetic thread inserts. Concern for such tiny fields is somewhat unusual in an e-beam tool operating at x-ray producing voltages. If we correctly remember a possibly related prior solicitation for the e-beam hardware, we understand that this is a high resolution, high positional accuracy application, that may, indeed have unusual requirements on residual fields.  If this is the case, we may need to suggest more exotic methods of construction, and materials. We have some experience with this, but need to know if there is a field specification, roughly at or below the Earth's own field. The user may also need to consider the effects of nearby equipment, such as the attached pump. Magnetic properties of stainless steel anywhere in the chamber, including threaded inserts and CF flanges, are not anticipated to cause problems with interference with magnetically steering the beam. 15. The solicitation restricts chamber weight to 800 pounds (ref paragraph 2.5). In the statement of work, there is reference to tapped holes in the chamber wall. Size preferred 1/4-20 x 1/2" deep. This requires a chamber wall thickness in excess of 1/2". Weight of a chamber of 1/2" exceeds the required weight. If one were to opt for the alternate 6-32 x 3/8 deep, that would require a 1/2" wall thickness also (reference paragraph 2.14). Is the 800 pound requirement realistic? Note also that the handholds specified for carrying the chamber (paragraph 2.10)imply that it will be manually carried.  Is that requirement realistic? Location of tapped holes is flexible to allow for aligning with stiffeners.  This would permit using a thinner minimum wall thickness thereby lowering overall weight.  The system may be manually moved on casters, thus handholds are requested for ease of positioning. 16. To achieve the required weight, it may be necessary to use non-flat sections for the doors. Would it be acceptable to have the viewports on short tubes, only long enough to allow the use of the non-flat sections. This approach would be acceptable.  Viewport tube length should be minimized to allow maximum visibility into the interior of the chamber. 17. There is a bracket that is shown on the top cover. It seems to be very close to the inside chamber wall. If the top is to be removable, the chamber will have to be made up to 3" larger to accommodate it. That makes the chamber larger and hence heavier. Can the bracket be redesigned? The bracket can be redesigned if necessary.  Provisions are still required to allow for hard mounting this hardware (a wire feeder) to the top of the chamber near the corner as shown in the sketches provided. Please answer the following questions: 17.  Are the dimensions shown on the PDF file inside chamber dimensions only? Yes. 18.  If yes, can there be structure intruding into the inside of the chamber? Yes.  Structure may intrude into the inside of the chamber on the four side walls and to the top of the chamber,	provided that the structure does not exceed 1 inch in height for the four side walls or the top, and provided that the height of the chamber be adjusted to the thickness of the structure added to the bottom of the chamber (for the positioning system).  The positioning system mounted to the bottom of the chamber drives the height of the chamber, so if that has been raised within the chamber, the distance top of the chamber needs to be compensated accordingly.  The design has attempted to minimize the chamber size as tightly yet allows installation of the positioning system within the chamber.  The positioning system measures 32.3 inches (in the fore-aft direction on the sketches) by 27.4 inches (in the right-left direction on the sketches) by 21.6 inches in height, and weighs approximately 100 lbs.

<DESC>This Amendment No. A001 is issued to provide questions and answers from the site visit held on 09/11/03.
1. QUESTION:  What type of UHF radio are you requesting, and what is the physical size, is it suitable for outdoor mounting, or will it require a NEMA 3R (weatherproof) enclosure, input parameters (audio input, type of PTT circuit, etc.), operating temperature ranges, power consumption/voltage/amps/watts, and the type of antenna to be used, as to size and Db. gain, impedance, and type of coax to connect the antenna/transmitter, (RG 58, RG213, RG214 etc).  All of this is addressed in the normal FAA type of VHF radio install and is covered by the type approval, but they have no guidelines for a UHF type of transmitter, as they normally don’t use UHF radios.
ANSWER:  As discussed at the site visit, FEMA is looking for the industry standard civilian/military for UHF weather station operations.  The Contractor shall install a UHF radio with the same type of weather protection/provisions as VHF radio.  The Contractor shall provide as part of their proposal the broadcast capabilities of their weather station, the type or model radio equipment the weather station can support, the power/connectivity requirements needed for the equipment, and what, if any, special protective enclosures their equipment will require.
2.  QUESTION:  Is the input format for FEMA’s in house cable system NTSC, PAL, baseband video, s-video, standard broadcast (VHF chn. 2-13, UHF chn. 14-83), or one of the cable TV bands (HRC, IHRC etc).  There is more than one type of system available from the vendors, with a wide range of cost and specifications.  What is compatible with FEMA’s system?  
ANSWER:  The input format is full broadband NTSC.
3.  QUESTION:  Reference paragraph B.10 of the Statement of Work.  Do you want 2 future displays provided now or the interface/ability to drive them at a later date?  Do you want 7 modems for telco dial in or 7 modems to interface with your network?
ANSWER:  The AWOS shall be integrated into an existing data processing system, LAN/Internet.  Location for (1) data processing computer is Bldg. 500.  Remote display locations are (1) Bldg. 420 and (1) Government install area.  As regards future displays, FEMA only wants 7 modems.  The remote modems shall be telephone dial in by hard-wired telephone lines.
4.  QUESTION: At Bldg. 500 at the electrical outlet, is there 220-volt electricity that the Contractor is to hook up to?
ANSWER:  The service is 208/120 volt, three phase, four wire.
The specified date for receipt of responses is unchanged from 09/19/03.  END OF AMENDMENT NO. A001 TO RFQ NO. EMV-2003-RQ-0028.

All responses are due not later than 11:00am (local time) Wednesday, October 1, 2003.  Comments, suggestions and questions about the proposed new technology may supplement or be incorporated into the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service’s (FNS) decision support system called the Anti-fraud Locator using EBT Retailer Transactions (ALERT).  FNS is in the process of formulating the acquisition and project strategy for the next base contract and as a result wants to identify commercially available technologies that could be either incorporated into the ALERT system or separately implemented.  FNS has obtained the support of Information Systems Support, Inc. (ISS) and MAXIMUS, Inc, as independent technical consultants assisting in the review of the RFI responses.  ISS/MAXIMUS is prohibited from submitting a proposal to any procurement request that may result from this RFI.  

All information submitted in response to this RFI will be used for planning purposes only.  FAR Clause 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) applies.  All information will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure.  Please ensure any sensitive or protected information is clearly marked as such.  FNS will consider all information received for future incorporation into ALERT as it evaluates the responses received from the vendor community.  This is not a formal solicitation under FAR Part 15 or a FAR Part 13 simplified acquisition, but a request for interested parties to provide information.  No solicitation document exists and requests for a solicitation will be unanswered.

An overview of data elements and other technical information regarding the current system may be accessed at the USDA website:  http://www.fns.usda.gov/.

COTS: Vendors with various technology products are encouraged to respond to this request with a high level concept paper that explains the approach and offers new technologies and/or methodologies that would improve the current tools of FNS in its analysis of ALERT data.  It is requested that responses include an estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude of the time and costs (hardware, software, and personnel) needed to design and implement.  We do not expect full cycle system developments to be offered, but are specifically interested in proven products, technologies and/or tools that enhance or provide additional capabilities to identify and monitor potential fraud using the existing and future data elements available from Food Stamp Program Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) transactions.  FNS will use the information received from the responses to this RFI to help determine the requirements for the next RFP for ALERT support.  FNS anticipates releasing the RFP for ALERT support in the 1st quarter of 2004.  

Current Architecture: The current ALERT application is a n-tiered server architecture that operates on Proliant 8500 servers using the Windows 2000 operating system and Sybase database system software.  The application software is programmed using Delphi.  There are four main software components 
¨	The ALERT analysis software includes specific scans that target certain suspect patterns of fraudulent activity.  ALERT utilizes data from two sources; transaction data that is received from the states operation EBT systems, and retailer data that is extracted from present mainframe systems that house the FNS national retailer database for authorizing and monitoring participating Food Stamp retailers.
¨	A web site provides user information on existing releases, tutorials and a data mart known as AMART.  
¨	ESSRA is a component which provides retailer management data that has been extracted weekly from the FNS national retailer tracking database.  ESSRA is used in the field and regional offices to manage daily retailer authorization activities and allows users to download data into standard Excel spreadsheets or Access tables for further manipulation 
¨	Watchlist is a management reporting tool designed to systemically track identified suspect retailers and the status of activities by FNS staff regarding each identified retailer.  
	
	FNS’ overall enterprise architecture is transitioning from mainframe to server and web-based technologies.  Current software standards require Section 508 compliance for all agency systems.  FNS is migrating to SQL Server 2000, which will become the database system for ALERT in the future.  Users are provided Windows 2000 and Office Suite products on their workstations or laptops installed with the ALERT application software.  Depending on access to the Department Wide Area Network, users connect via the WAN or utilize dial-in capabilities.  Future solutions may entail use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for secured connections via the Internet.  The solution we may deploy would need to be supportable on our present and future system architecture; however, we will not preclude any technological tools should they present an innovative tool that merits consideration in this initiative.  
	
	Background: ALERT is a decision support management system built around the retailer management and compliance requirements of the Food Stamp Program.  The primary purpose is to load and analyze food stamp transactional data, e.g., food stamp purchases in any of 150,000 authorized food stamp retailer locations.  Data is submitted to FNS by State EBT processors each month.   Only a few States remain to be implemented, the largest being California.  At present, there are nearly 70 million transactions processed monthly and a rolling 6 months of data is maintained on-line.  When all states have implemented EBT, monthly transaction data is estimated to be about 85 million transactions.  Key elements of each electronic transaction are extracted by the EBT processors and provided to the ALERT system.  This data includes information such as dollar amount, location, terminal ID, date and time of the transaction, type of entry (card swiped through a reader or manually key –entered), and whether a paper voucher was issued.
	
	Business Requirements: FNS is looking for technology and analytic tools that can enhance the current system functionality.  The FNS preference is that the system architecture is web and server based.  The system must be accessible to a user base of over 600 local and remote users that are accessing data for inquiry, query, and download.  Users currently access the system via a wide area network or through dial-up access.  Any proposed solution should be able to offer the following:  
¨	Ability to identify evolving trends in suspect retailer behavior as they change.
¨	Allow for ad hoc query capabilities
¨	Identify possible relationships that either enhance existing scans and pattern analysis or support the overall retailer management and integrity goals of FNS.
¨	Support set pattern analysis within the FNS systems environment.

There is considerable latitude for the range of proposed solutions.  These could include COTS solutions, improvement of existing methodologies, or some new technology.  The proposed solution is desired to be compatible with existing and planned systems architecture within FNS.  However, should a solution not be compatible with said architecture, yet otherwise possess merit and benefit to accomplishing the objectives of FNS, it will be considered.

Future Considerations:  The existing data analysis being performed within ALERT has undergone limited revision since its inception.  The current requirements for data being received from the EBT processors have not been altered since the system was initiated in 1996/1997.  There is additional information within the transaction data being collected by the EBT processors that may be of use to FNS, such as telephone nodes or card replacements.  Consequently, new data elements may be added in the future to the transaction records being received from the EBT processors.  Potential solutions being recommended by the vendor community should take this into consideration.

Responses:  Vendors interested in responding to this RFI need to submit a capability statement that clearly and convincingly identifies their capabilities.  In addition, potential vendors must substantiate their capability with the following supplemental information: methodology, technical data, design, brochures, product names, etc.  If these items are available under a GSA schedule, please provide the contract schedule and information.  All responses must be received no later than 11:00am (local time) Wednesday, October 1, 2003.  Responses must be submitted to the following address:  USDA/FNS/ASD/CMB, Tina M Nevitt Contracting Officer, 3101 Park Center Drive Room 228, Alexandria, VA   22302-1500.  Your response shall not exceed 15 single sided pages, plus supplemental information.  You are required to include an electronic copy in Microsoft Word or a compatible format (Adobe PDF).

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0002 is to respond to vendor questions received to date.  Amendment 0001 was erroneously posted twice on 15 Sep 03.  It is a duplicate amendment, please disregard one of them.  QUESTION:  What is the expected call volume?  It is requested that historical data be provided.  ANSWER:  We have no historical data since this is a new travel system and more people will be using the Defense Travel System than PerDiemAzing.  Also, we expect more calls when users first begin using DTS but that will level out after the users get familiar with the system and get through the learning curve.  We estimated that the first few months the Help Desk will receive 30-50 inquires each day for assistance.  After three or four months we expect the calls to level off to less than 25 calls a day.  QUESTION:   How many seats, desks, chairs, and telephones will DLA provide?  ANSWER:  One seat, two chairs (one for desk and one for a visitor), one phone.  QUESTION:  Are the DLA-provided telephones equipped with voice-mail capability?  ANSWER:  Yes.  QUESTION:   Are the DLA-provided telephones equipped with Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)?  If so, is it shared with other activities/programs?  ANSWER:  No.  QUESTION:  Will DLA provide multiple telephones with individual voice-mail capable of rollover?  No.  QUESTION:  Does DLA have a centralized telephone number for the Help Desk?  ANSWER:  Yes.  QUESTION:  Does DLA have a centralized 800 number for the Help Desk?  ANSWER:  No.  QUESTION:  Have the required Help Desk Reports been created?  ANSWER:  Yes.  The reports are in the system.  QUESTION:  Is report development and design required?  ANSWER:  No, DTS contains the reports.  You just need to tell the system the information you wish to pull to run the reports.  Offers are due no later than 22 September 2003, 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, and may be delivered to the Andrew T. McNamara Headquarters Complex, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Suite 1145, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6220.  Please contact Ms. Brenda Geist (brenda.geist@dla.mil) for information regarding the solicitation.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to modify contract number 200-2002-00540 with Westat, Inc. to add a data collection supplement to the National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). The supplement will include a survey of paraprofessional workers in a sub-sample of facilities participating in the NNHS.   To reduce data collection redundancy, reduce respondent burden, assure timely fielding of the paraprofessional workers’ supplement, and substantially reduce the costs of the supplement, the fielding of the supplemental data collection activity must be with the original contractor.  This announcement is not a request for proposal. (See Note 22).

<DESC>The U.S Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806- 5000 is interested in acquiring information to determine the  qualifications of private industry to manufacture full-scale, inert, M231 and M232 Training Aids that contain sectioned M231 and M232 charges in their  corresponding sectioned metal ammo storage containers. The 155mm M231/M232  propelling charges known as MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System) are two  different propelling charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal,  that provide a complete zoning solution for 155MM Artillery applications by  using multiples of a basic increment.  During development and fielding of the  MACS charge, the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted for the  creation of full-scale displays and reduced-scale training aids of the MACS to illustrate charge construction, packaging and field application. The M231  charges are used at lower zones (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3 through 6). The training aids include producing  thirty (30) M231 and thirty (30) M232 Packaged Cutaways that are displayed in  their metal ammunition storage container.  Since soldiers will be training  with these cutaways, it is important that they are of the same quality and  construction as the “live” version while using inert materials.  The MACS and  their components are on the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL), Aug  1996. Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act  (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to DoD Directives 5230.24 and  5230.25. Firms with experience in the areas cited above should provide a  summary of their company’s capabilities including a description of facilities,  personnel, past experience and indicate whether large or small business to meet this requirement. This Market survey is for planning purposes only and  should not be construed as a request for proposal or as a commitment on the  part of the Government to issue a solicitation. Any information or samples  supplied to the government in response to this market survey shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government is not  obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. All responses  should be sent by email to mrhines@pica.army.mil.  See numbered note 8.

Youth in transition to and from juvenile justice institutions are one of the most at-risk groups of students.  Making this transition work depends on three factors: 1) effective, appropriate academic instruction based on curriculum, with standards aligned with the schools and delivered based on the timely assessments of students; 2) provision of additional support for students with co-existing issues (e.g., substance abuse or mental heath issues) that may inhibit their ability to focus on and perform well in school; and 3) coordination around the student's needs between sending/receiving institutions and amongst the multiple service entities involved with helping the student.  Given these factors, the purpose of this contract is to find cases where institutions or States have used innovative approaches to address youth transition and produce a report that will discuss how this transition is addressed to support the academic achievement of institutionalized youth.  Task:  To develop summaries of states and sites focusing on and using innovative approaches to address the issues of youth transition to and from juvenile justice institutions.

<SUBJECT>F -- Disentanglement Services
<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, Eastern Administrative Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Center for Coastal Studies for disentanglement services in accordance with Congressional directives.  Several species of endangered marine mammals are subject to entanglement in active and derelict commercial fishing gear.  The endangered species of most concern in the Northeast Region is the northern right whale, Eubalaena glacialis.  The minimum population estimate upon which management actions are currently based is approximately 300 animals for the Western North Atlantic stock of the northern right whale population.  Scaring patterns on known individual right whales indicate that a minimum of 72% of the remaining population exhibit signs of entanglement in fishing gear.  A second species of concern is the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae.  For humpback whales, entanglement in fishing gear is the most prevalent human-induced take observed in the Northeast.  It has been estimated that 50% of the humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine sub-stock bear scars from entanglement.  The Center for Coastal Studies will be required to establish, maintain, and operate a program for responding to reports of entangled whales (alive or dead) and for dissemination of knowledge gained from the response effort.  This includes the U.S. coastline from Maine through and including the Atlantic coast of Florida.  The statutory authority for this action is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Oly One Responsible Source.

APPENDIX – A

DIAGNOSIS, REPAIR AND CND PROCESS
The contractor will diagnose the customer complaint to the component or the sub-assembly if component level repair is not possible.  If the customer complaint is verified and no estimate is required (see section 2.0), the contractor will perform repairs in accordance with manufacturers standard repair procedures and pricing as outlined in Appendix E. 
If the failure described by the customer cannot be duplicated, the contractor will perform the following procedure:
The unit will be placed in an environmental chamber.  Ambient temperature of the environmental chamber will be set to 0°C.  The contractor will then perform appropriate testing in an attempt to duplicate the customer complaint.   
If the customer complaint is not found during the cold cycle, the temperature of the environmental chamber will be increased to 50°C.  The unit will then be allowed to operate until the internal temperature of the test unit has stabilized. The contractor will then perform appropriate testing in an attempt to duplicate the customer complaint.  
If the problem cannot be duplicated, the contractor will involve Government Quality Assurance Representative (GQAR) or nominated representative.  Contractor and GQAR will review testing status and determine what additional steps may be taken to duplicate failure before the unit is returned.  
If contractor and GQAR believe a reasonable effort has been made to duplicate the customer complaint diagnostic testing shall be discontinued.  The contractor will contact the customer to discuss satisfactory resolution of the complaint.
If the failure is covered by the contract as a normal operational failure (see section 2.0), then the fixed firm pricing structure in appendix E will be used.
If an estimate is required (see section 2.0), the contractor will prepare and present an estimate based upon the failure, to the customer for their review. Customer approval will be by fax or other hardcopy documentation.  After receiving approval, repairs and/or replacements will proceed.  Estimated items not approved for repair and/or replacement by the customer will be left unrepaired.  
Contractor will replace module and continue troubleshooting the unit to confirm that unit is working properly. Once the unit is repaired to a satisfactory condition, the contractor will perform calibration and/or verification in accordance with steps outlined in paragraph 4.0 and 5.0.






APPENDIX - B

CALIBRATION OF TS4317-1
Before any electrical testing is carried out, the unit will receive a mechanical inspection, and any rework will be performed as required.  The unit will then be cased up.
Returned units will follow the cell line as detailed in appendix G.  After completion of each process activity (as detailed on the process map), a cell line operator will note on the cal/test sheet the type of activity performed under “TEST”, the date the activity was performed under “DATE” whether the unit passed or failed under “P/F” and the badge number of the person performing the test under “OPER”  
The unit will process through the ‘bring up’ station, Cell 1 through Cell 4 for calibration and verification and Cell 5 for verification. Test results will be generated as required.                                                                                                    
If a failure occurs at Cell 1, the unit will be returned to Cell 1. If the unit fails at any point after that, the unit will be repaired and returned to the cell line according to the recalibration-testing matrix. 
The appropriate calibration sticker will then be affixed to the outside of the unit.  The Contractor will complete the paperwork and deliver unit to Shipping/Receiving. 
If ANSI Compliant calibration was requested, contractor will deliver unit to QATA. QATA will perform ANSI Compliant testing and attach the appropriate calibration sticker to unit. 
Contractor will complete paperwork and deliver unit to Shipping/Receiving.



























APPENDIX - C

REQUIRED RETURN AUTHORIZATION

The contractor shall forward a copy of the return authorization to Shipping/Receiving, Quality Assurance and GQAR to notify them of the incoming unit  















APPENDIX - D
RECEIVING UNITS INTO THE WORKSHOP
Shipping/Receiving and GQAR shall unpack the unit, record its condition, and inventory accessories on the workshop computer system.   
Upon unpacking the unit, if visual damage is present, Shipping/Receiving shall carry out a physical inspection.  Shipping/Receiving shall save the shipping carton for shippers’ evaluation and complete the damage shipment form on the workshop receiving computer system.
If shipping damage is present, Shipping/Receiving shall deliver unit to QATA for ANSI-In testing. 
After paperwork is received, QATA shall perform ANSI-In testing, to document failure upon receiving damaged unit.
Upon completion of ANSI-In testing, contractor shall pick up unit from QATA for damage estimate.

The USUHS will work with the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) and use the definition of bioterrorist agents as defined by HRSA in the fiscal year 2002 Program Announcement. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program is not only preparing the Nation’s hospitals against bioterrorism attacks but also for mass casualty events against terrorist attacks using nuclear, chemical, or conventional weapons.  HRSA has provided funds to upgrade bioterrorism hospital preparedness to the state level.  Needed are: a tool to (1) provide a national measure of overall preparedness to serve as a baseline against which to later compare the effects of the fund allocation and (2) help guide any further allocation and a mechanism to validate the survey instrument.
The purpose of this study is to assess the readiness potential of individual hospitals as well as evaluating readiness based on individual communities, metropolitan statistical areas (MSA’s), and any other geographical or political separation. The study will also address readiness to respond to a variety of other circumstances, including response capability to biological, nuclear, radiation, chemical, and threats posed  by conventional weapons on a large scale.   The results of this study will be analyzed and explained in descriptive reports in order to be submitted to HRSA.  This study of bioterrorism preparedness of U. S. hospitals will involve not only individual hospital preparedness, but also the interaction and coordination of military and civilian counterparts, i. e. medical personnel, hospitals, disaster planners, first responders and researchers.  The potential contractor must have (1) demonstrated ability to support the USUHS led effort by creating an effective research support infrastructure, (2) academic affiliations providing access to cutting-edge science, technology, and cross-disciplinary knowledge in the field of bio-terrorism and response to emergency situations, (3) established relationships with military and civilian medical organizations involving medical executive and medical administration education, (4) proven ability to provide medical, scientific, management, and administrative, and support employees.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. 	General: Remove prairie dogs from FCI Englewood in accordance with state and local wildlife removal regulations.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining ALL applicable permits for the removal and transportation of extracted prairie dogs. Additionally, the contractor will be responsible for furnishing an insurance certificate providing the minimum liability requirements mandated by the state of Colorado.  This contract is for a one time removal process. 

2.	The contractor will be responsible for removing and relocating approximately 20 prairie dogs per acre from an area of approximately 200 acres.

3.        The contractor will remove all prairie dogs by non-lethal means from the established prairie             dog free zones.  Also, the contractor will utilize the same methods to reduce the numbers               of prairie dogs within the control zones to acceptable levels established by the Colorado                  Department of Wildlife, if the population exceeds the recommended population levels.  

4.        Live capture will be implemented during the time of year when ground conditions and                     reproductive cycles are most favorable for live capture.  If other wildlife is extracted                       and/or captured, they may be relocated also.  The desired target date for completion of the             removal and relocation is November 30, 2003. 

5.       Captured prairie dogs will be relocated elsewhere on the institution’s property (control                     zones if population levels permit), to areas participating in the black-footed ferret                            restoration program, or to other areas within the region where prairie dogs are being re-                 established in accordance with state and county requirements.  
	Relocation of prairie dogs to elsewhere on the institution’s property will only be considered when all of the following conditions occur:

	&#8210;	Other relocation programs are not available
	&#8210;	FCI Englewood has available unoccupied habitat in the prairie dog control zones
	&#8210;	There is no current outbreak of disease within ½ mile radius of the facility

6.       Per recommendations from the Colorado Division of Wildlife, a range of 5 to 10  prairie                 dogs per acre are to be left in the control zones.  FCI Englewood will use this                                 recommendation for prairie dogs remaining in the control zone.   

7.       Prior to relocation, captured prairie dogs should be held according to prescribed state                     wildlife regulations.  The approved release program is responsible for the final method of                 release once they are delivered.  The contractor is responsible for transportation and/or                  disposal of all prairie dogs removed from the institution property.

8.       Removal by lethal methods may be required when conditions do not favor non-lethal                       methods.  Dead animals that are recovered will be handled and disposed of by the                           contractor in compliance with local requirements. 


9.       For lethal methods, treat burrows located within the prairie dog free zone to eliminate any              remaining animals and animals that may try to reoccupy prairie dog free zones.

10.     Burrows that have been cleared by the contractor will be filled by the contractor.                             Establishment of habitat modifications, i.e., perches, barriers and vegetation will be                          conducted by the institution.
