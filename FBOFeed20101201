<DESC>NASA/ ARC desires to transition technical and operational materials and knowledgefrom  its developers to NASA/ ARC for sustaining engineering and operation of theSynchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) HardwareSystem. In support of this effort, NASA/ ARC has an instant requirement for Seven (7)units SPHERES Ground System Hardware and One hundred (100) Units SPHERES Flight SystemHardware with the following specifications:1. One (1) SPHERES Ground System Hardware consists with the    following:    One Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Module      o Sundance DSP Module SMT375 (Same Model as currently used         in flight SPHERES Satellite)    Delivery for SPHERE Ground System Hardware instructions:     o All units delivered within ten (10) weeks of award.     o Hold at AFS facility and Provide Letter of Receipt and         Acceptance to NASA Ames Research Center.2. One (1) SPHERES Flight System Hardware consists of  the    following:    One (1) SPHERES Flight certified Battery Pack     o Battery Pack- part number SPH-1-0800-020     o Flight Certification Documentation:	-Battery Specification Sheet	-Battery Vendor MSDS	-Battery Pack Materials List	-Battery Board Test Activity Logs	-Cell-Level Vacuum Test Logs	-Battery Pack Thermal Test Logs	-Hardware Assembly and Inspection Log	-Hardware Certificate of Compliance   Delivery for SPHERES Flight certified Battery Pack     instructions:     o All units delivered within ten (10) weeks of award. Phased       delivery acceptable. Minimum quantity per delivery 25        Units.     o Delivery Battery Packs and Flight Certification Hardware       to        NASA Ames Research Center.NASA/ ARC intends to procure these items on a non-competitive basis from Aurora FlightSciences (AFS). In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), AFS is determined to be the onlysource reasonably available given the proprietary and time-sensitive circumstances of theaction. AFS (jointly with MIT) is the original designer and manufacturer of the SPHERESGround and Flight Systems Hardware.The flight certified battery packs, the design and fabrication process of which areproprietary to AFS, are urgently needed to meet the proposed launch schedule. TheSundance DSP Module SMT375 is a long lead sub-component to be held at AFS forincorporation into the SPHERES Ground test satellite and electronic stack test-beds. Thismodel is specifically required because it is critical that the ground test hardware usedto perform verification and validation of the flight software is identical to the flighthardware currently used aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Sundance no longerproduces DSP Modules but dues to an existing relationship with AFS, Sundance willmanufacture the remaining required units within the required schedule.Although the Government does not anticipate competition, interested organizations maysubmit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort via email to theidentified point of contact no later than 10 a.m. local time on December 16, 2010. Suchcapabilities/ qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis,The NAICS Code and Standard Size are 336419 and 1,000 employees respectively.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>Market Survey / Request for Information (RFI) AnnouncementEnterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS) Small Business Set-Aside
This is a Market Survey Capability Assessment for Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS). This draft SIR (RFI) is intended to assess Small Business capabilities. 
1. IntroductionThe purpose of this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) is to: (1)	Obtain industry comments on the attached sections of the small business set-aside draft Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS) acquisition.  This is the second of two draft SIRs the FAA has released for industry review and comment.  The first SIR was posted to FAACO on September 15, 2010, and a Comments Response Matrix was posted on November 18, 2010.  The attached 'ECSS Small Business Set Aside SIR Change Matrix' reflects only the differences between the Full & Open and Set Aside as they relate to small business requirements.  Multiple other updates have been incorporated throughout the SIR as a result of the RFI comments received; and (2) Survey the marketplace to assess the level of interest among qualified providers of the required services.
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that: This is not a SIR or Request for Proposals; The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals; The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and Any costs associated with the market survey/RFI response submittals are solely at the interested party's expense.
2. Description of the Required ServicesThe ATC Communications Services Directorate is responsible for the implementation and execution of communications infrastructure programs supporting the National Airspace System (NAS).  Three of the programs - System Wide Information Management (SWIM), Data Communications (DataComm), and NAS Voice System (NVS) - are designated as "NextGen-enabling" programs because of their fundamental role in supporting the transformation of the NAS to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The ECSS Contractors will provide vital support to the planning, procurement, implementation, and execution of these and other ATC Communications programs as they progress through their life cycles. 
The contracts will provide a broad range of Program Management, Acquisition Support, System Engineering, Operations Management and Support, Business and Financial Management, and other services required by the Directorate.  The requirements are more fully described in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  
3. Nature of the CompetitionThe FAA is contemplating award of two competitive single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts (one unrestricted competition and one small business set-aside) each with periods of performance of seven years (two year base and five one-year option periods).
4. NAICS CodeThe NAICS codes for the small business set-aside have not yet been finalized, but are currently expected to be:- 541330, Engineering Services - Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, $27M; and - 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, 1,500 employees.
5. Incumbent ContractorsThe ATC Communications Directorate currently obtains its support services through a wide variety of large and small business service contracts and task orders, most of which are expiring in the next 12 to 18 months.  The current level of effort is approximately 350-380 full-time equivalents (FTEs), but the FAA expects that quantity to decrease under the ECSS contracts due to organizational realignments and other efficiency gains.  However, the ECSS contractors must be capable of sustaining the current level of support if the expected efficiency gains cannot be realized.  The specific staffing requirements will be definitized through the issuance of task orders and the FTE levels referenced in this announcement do not represent a commitment on the part of the FAA to staff the ECSS contracts at a particular level of effort.
6. Contract TypeThe FAA anticipates awarding IDIQ type contracts with Fixed Price Level of Effort task orders being issued for the required support services. 
7. Responses to the Market Survey/RFIInterested parties should submit the following items in response to this Market Survey/RFI by January 3, 2011.(a) A one page letter of transmittal.(b) A two page Capabilities Statement (12 point Times New Roman font, 1 inch margins) that includes the following information: Type of services provided by your company relative to the scope of the ECSS effort as described in the draft SIR.   Contracts under which your company has provided these types of services in the past 5 years including the name of the contract, client, your company's staffing level on the contract (# of FTEs), your company's percentage of the total staffing, and your company's role on the contract (prime or subcontractor).  Number of years your company has been in business. Geographical areas where your company can provide the services identified in the draft SIR.(c)  Completed Draft SIR Comment Matrix - Firms interested in commenting on the attached ECSS draft SIR sections may do so by providing any questions, recommendations, comments, or suggestions that may assist the FAA in the development of the final solicitation document.  The FAA may post responses to select questions/comments submitted by the due date.  The identity of the vendor submitting the comment/question will not be revealed. Please provide your response via email using the attached comment template.  There is no page limit for the completed comment matrix.(d) A completed and signed Business Declaration Form.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit for Medical Administrator Services (also known as the Third Party Administrator). The administrator will provide health care administration services for a group of Saudi military personnel assigned to the United States and Canada and their authorized dependants. This requirement is for administration and bill paying only and is not for the medical insurance itself. The Administrator will provide a claim system for the submittal of claims by various health care providers, screen the claims to determine if the coverage under the benefit conforms and are considered reasonable and customary, and promptly pay the provider accordingly.
 The Administrator will be reimbursed for claims paid out through the contract. The Administrator must have access to a working fund from which initial payments for claims will be made pending reimbursement under the contract.  These services are needed to support the Naval Education and Training Security Assistance Field Activity (NETSAFA), Pensacola, FL.  It is anticipated that the Navy will solicit a firm fixed price requirements type contract for the administrator services with cost type line items for reimbursement of the actual medical claims. The Period of Performance is 1 August 2011 through 31 July 2012, with four-one year option periods. Interested vendors will be required to submit price and technical proposals and the evaluation for contract award resulting from the forthcoming solicitation will consider the technical proposal more important than the price proposal.
 The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 524292 with a size standard of $7.0 million. The solicitation shall be solicited on an unrestricted basis. The Navy is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described services. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Navy. The RFP will be made available on or about 1/11/2011 on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil). The Government point of contact for this effort is Ms. Stephanie Wilson who can be reached at 215-697-9628 or via email at Stephanie.wilson1@navy.mil.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Procedures, and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan  48105, requires a commercially available a High Load, High Resolution, Mass Comparator Balance.
Many car manufacturers are now producing flexible fuel vehicles.  To facilitate the testing and ultimate certification of these vehicles, there is a need to blend specialty fuels or biofuels.  These fuels are blended in stainless steel fuel pods and the process includes adding small (trace) amounts of spiking component to a large amount of base fuel.  This has left us with a need to be able to accurately measure the trace amounts for mass percent.  We are currently using a vehicle scale which has a readability of a pound.  We need an accurate balance that has a readability and accuracy of one gram.
This balance shall be a commercial item, from an offeror that has manufactured the same item previously. It shall not be a prototype or one-of-a-kind unit.  The installation procedure shall meet ISO 17025 requirements. The calibration shall be NIST traceable, be calibrated as part of the installation, and a Calibration Certificate issued that meets ISO 17025 requirements.  	The balance shall have a capacity of at least 2500 kG. The mass at which this balance is expected to be used is very close to 2500 kG.  The balance shall have readability of 1G or better.  The balance shall have repeatability of 7G or less near the maximum capacity.  The balance shall have linearity of 100G or less.  The balance shall have a weighing range that extends up to the maximum capacity of the balance.  The balance shall have a tarring range that extends up to the maximum capacity of the balance.  The balance shall have a settling time of 5 seconds or less.  The balance platform shall have dimensi ons of at least 110 cm. by 125 cm. since the objects to be weighed are 107 cm. by 122 cm. at their base. It shall not exceed 130 cm. by 160 cm. due to footprint limitations and our ability to manage larger objects.
This procurement will be conducted under Full and Open Competition utilizing NAICS code 333999 with a size standard of 500 Employees.  Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria.  Any responsible source believing itself capable of providing the required Mass Comparator Balance may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation will be posted at the FedBizOpps website approximately 15 days after electronic posting of this synopsis.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be submitted in writing to Annette Niedermier via Fax (735) 214-4217 or email niedermier.annette @epa.gov

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for developing technology solutions addressing critical deficiencies in Live -Virtual - Constructive (LVC) training solutions for Naval aviation. As defined by the Department of Defense (DoD Instruction 1322.18) the components of LVC training include:
<p>1) Live Simulations, which represent the natural physical environment in which individuals or teams operate their systems and platforms for rehearsal and training purposes. Typically, these environments are closely similar to the expected operational environments, with modifications to the systems and platforms that support performance assessment and maintain range safety.</p>
<p>2) Virtual Simulations, which are synthetic environments that include the replication of warfighting equipment and operational environmental conditions; allows for the sharing of a common environment which multiple users can access; and supports interactions with simulated entities (including objects, avatars, and equipment) that mirror, in response fidelity, those that would occur in the real world.</p>
<p>3) Constructive Simulations which are simulated forces that respond to trainee actions. Typically, real human inputs are needed to fully operate these simulated forces which then carry out the resultant actions in a synthetic environment. Semi-automated Forces (SAFs) are one example of constructive simulations; Wargaming models are another example.</p>
<p>Current LVC environments do not adequately satisfy training fidelity requirements in terms of: the Virtual Simulations in which training occurs; the behaviors exhibited by the Constructive Simulations; and, the integration of the Virtual and Constructive components with the Live platforms and displays that trainees use. This call requests proposals that will improve the effectiveness of the training delivered by LVC technologies by delivering safer representations of Virtual and Constructive Simulations within Live platform displays; improving Virtual Simulation realism; and, creating more believable Constructive Simulation behaviors.</p>
<p>White Papers are required prior to submitting a Full Proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Technology Acquisition Center, located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ, intends to enter into a twelve-month firm-fixed-price contract, with options for Enhancements, on the basis of full and open competition for "Strategic Incubation Initiative - Development of a Chemotherapy Ordering Management System" for the VHA Innovation Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Office of Health Information (OHI).

The VHA has one of the largest cancer populations in the country. It is also the fastest growing group of patients within the VHA. Oncology, a uniquely high-risk and high-complexity domain of health care, has not been effectively implemented in the existing VA Electronic Health Record (EHR) - Veterans Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture (VistA). The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) lacks critical functions required for oncology. This creates a clinical environment with a lack of standardization and limited direct order entry of chemotherapy. On a site by site basis, the current hybrid oncology practice is a mix of paper-based and computer based practices and is associated with frequent error, adverse events, and inefficiencies.

The VHA Innovation Program is responsible for ensuring critical healthcare innovations reliant on information technology emerge from the field, which include all VA medical care facilities outside of headquarters.  This program enables information technology (IT) to evolve based on collaborative constructive review by communities of interest and ensures innovations will be piloted to a safe harbor.  Innovations that are proven and vetted from business and technical perspectives will have a pathway for organizational acceptance and diffusion.  

The goal of this Chemotherapy Ordering Management System effort is to develop a software code prototype that could ultimately be passed to VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) organization for possible nationwide implementation.  This innovative project will be an iterative progression of software code development to create modules of functionality using rapid and agile development methodologies which allow numerous user reviews and interactions of software code throughout the life of the contract to continually gain and gauge user/provider input driving to the best user centered product possible.

The Chemotherapy Ordering Management System shall be an automated ordering and management process available in the VHA clinical practice setting to accommodate the unique needs of chemotherapy ordering.  The Chemotherapy Ordering Management System shall enhance and standardize capabilities to meet direct entry of chemotherapy orders needs of the oncology practice.  It shall interface and interact with existing, applicable VHA health care systems, module and processes and CPRS/ Vista database.  The five main focus and priority areas for the initial system development are as follows: 

1. Chemotherapy Template Order Source - a central library of chemotherapy regimen templates that allows providers to download and modify on local level.
2. Order Entry Management - a user-friendly system that provides dose calculation transparency and consistency of ordering regardless of treatment location.
3. Flow Sheet - a patient-centered documentation of the administration of chemotherapy through relevant documentation and efficient display of information for multiple providers.
4. Nursing Documentation - a document of drug administration that fulfills legal/professional requirements and fulfills Joint Commission compliance
5. End of Treatment Summary - a chronological history of diagnosis, treatment, changes in treatment, tumor response and patient outcomes that take 10-15 minutes to complete

The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-11-RP-0014 and will be issued on or about December 13, 2010. An award date of no later than January 31, 2011 is desired. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS Code/Size is 541512/$25M. This notification shall close on Friday, December 10, 2010. Questions/responses shall be submitted to the contract specialist at Jaemi.victor@va.gov. The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Jaemi Victor, Contract Specialist, Jaemi.victor@va.gov and Jan Oberdick, Contracting Officer, jan.oberdick@va.gov.

<DESC><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAIABLE AT THIS TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO AND WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM POTENTIAL SOURCES AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.<br /><br />The 49th Contracting Squadron, Holloman AFB, New Mexico is seeking the interest of potential and eligible SMALL BUSINESS contractors for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC). This is a Sources Sought announcement; a market survey for written information only. This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing work which includes all materials, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, supervision, management and other services (including engineering/technical design support) necessary to accomplish non-complex minor construction, maintenance, repair and renovation work on real property with possible design requirements at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico federal installation.

<p>A brief functional overview is provided in an attachment to this notice. It is likely that there will be revisions to the functional responsibilities prior to any solicitation for this requirement.</p>
<p>Note that this Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only. The applicable NAICS code is 561210 with an associated small business size standard of $35,500,000 average annual revenue.</p>
<p>The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used to develop an acquisition strategy and future solicitation. The Air Force is considering whether to set aside this Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition for competitive 8(a), HUBZone SB, Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB, or SB concerns. If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on a "full and open" basis.</p>
<p>If this effort is to be set aside, then a clause such as FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel will have to be expended for employees of the prime contractor.</p>
<p>All interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns are invited to respond. In order to be considered, responses must be organized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Positive statement of intent to submit a proposal for this solicitation as a prime contractor. Include a description of how the 50% requirement would be met. Describe how anticipated subcontractors, if any, would be selected and which functional areas they would be responsible for.</p>
<p>2. Evidence of successful performance within the past three (3) years of no more than five (5) contract efforts similar in magnitude and scope to the work described in this notice. Include information such as Statements of Work and description of facilities support tasks, as well as contract amounts, performance periods, and points of contact.</p>
<p>3. Demonstration of access to organizational resources, especially qualified and experienced personnel, needed for this type of work. This may include resources either within the prime contractor's organization or available through a subcontracting relationship. Ensure it is clearly stated whether the resources would be available from the prime or subcontractor. If subcontracting is contemplated, indicate whether the prime and subcontractor have successfully fulfilled similar efforts together in the past.</p>
<p>4. Description of prime contractor's Program Management and Quality Control methodologies. This should be general and not exceed two (2) pages in length.</p>
<p>5. Description of how any significant geographic separation between the prime contractor's primary office and AFRL Rome Research Site would be successfully overcome. Please address the feasibility of a limited on-site presence, such as a contractor Program Manager.</p>
<p>6. Documentation of current 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, or SB status such as SBA certification letter or other evidence. (For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov)</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration invites you to submit a responseto this inquiry, to assist in planning for the development of woven materials for futureNASA exploration missions.  ARC is actively pursuing concepts and opportunities for technology development. Specifically this includes manufacturing techniques that could produce thermo-structuralcomponents (implemented in the dry or infused state) for applications at temperaturesreaching 2500-3000F.  We are interested in gaining a better understanding of industrialcapabilities to assist us in the development, maturation and incorporation of woventextile concepts. Woven materials and capabilities sought include, but are not limited to:1) Ability to weave 3-D textiles (provide minimum and maximum thickness capability interms of number of layers and dimensional units);2) Types of 3D tow/yarn architectures including off axis capability;3) Ability to weave multiple high temperature fiber types (carbon, phenolic, polyimide,oxide/ceramic fibers including silica and SiC) list specific types of each family;4) Ability to weave multiple fiber sizes into a single textile;5) Ability to adjust warp tow/yarn tension/straightness;6) Ability to vary the fiber density in thickness, warp, and weft directions;7) Ability to vary textile thickness in warp and weft directions;8) Ability to incorporate pockets, cells, and other internal features in both warp andweft directions (sizes, spacing, etc.);9) Ability to incorporate discrete loops, tangs, ears, ribs, or similar protrudingfeatures in both warp and weft directions (sizes, spacing, etc.);10) Ability to weave wide textiles in curved forms (~10m width at ~10m radius, and ifapplicable provide manufacturability of one with respect to the other, ie: can produce10m width with no curvature, 5m width at 10m radius, etc.);11) Ability to prevent woven textile ends from unraveling;12) Ability to join two woven textile ends via stitching;13) Ability to process textiles weighing several thousand pounds.ARC is interested in understanding the state-of-the-art of these capabilities on anindividual basis as well as understanding how the capabilities change when combined (ie:capability of processing a two thousand pound textile with internal pockets woven withcarbon and phenolic fibers).

Potential studies may focus on facilitating high-priority evaluation studies, evaluation and information syntheses, policy and environmental assessments, performance measurement tools and systems and strengthening evaluation capability.</p>
<p>Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency of HRSA-Supported Programs, Program Components and Initiatives may include studies that focus on the effectiveness and efficiency of HRSA-supported programs - for example, operations (i.e., the best way to accomplish program goals); achievement of specified objectives and goals; and potential development of performance measures in light of the Agency's GPRA and PART requirements.</p>
<p>Additional examples of potential studies include addressing such topics as: implementation of planned program models or designs; program functioning, including assessment of the efficiency of program management; quality improvement approaches and results; client perception of program availability and accessibility; accomplishment of operational targets, meeting standards, and following national guidelines; and identification of "best practices" among a number of similar program sites</p>
<p>Assessment of Environmental/Policy Issues which may impact HRSA-supported Activities includes those studies that will primarily focus on either 1) the external context of programs and how forces in the larger society affect HRSA programs and their progress toward achieving goals and objectives (e.g., health and human service system changes, such as the increase in managed care or the changes in the welfare system; social, economic and political changes, such as the increase in population without health insurance, etc.) or 2) the development and assessment of various policy alternatives related to HRSA programs or interests (i.e., how actual, planned, or potential changes in current public and private policies and implementation strategies would affect attainment of program goals and objectives. Examples of studies may include 1) interaction of local, state, and Federal policies with HRSA-supported activities; 2) impact of changes in financial policy by Federal payers on the recipients of HRSA funds and their clients or patients.<br />Strengthening Evaluation Capability includes those studies that will focus primarily on either 1) determination and strengthening of the capacity for health-related evaluation both within HRSA and among its grantees; or 2) design, development, and assessment of health-related evaluation data systems.</p>
<p>Studies related to the determination and strengthening of capacity for health-related evaluation could focus on the following types of activities: identifying current needs and recommendations for programs both within HRSA and among its grantees to conduct effective evaluation; providing technical assistance and training to help build evaluation capacity among HRSA grantees; support of activities that strengthen local health-related evaluation efforts.</p>
<p>Studies related to the design, development, and assessment of health-related evaluation data systems will focus on health-related evaluation data and data systems issues including such studies as: the design of data systems that could be used for program monitoring and to measure the performance and impact of HRSA-supported activities; the development and testing of these data systems; the evaluation, modification, or refinement of existing HRSA data systems to make them more useful for monitoring and evaluation purposes; exploration, development and implementation of methodologies for linking national data sets; linking national data sets with State data; and linking data across states.<br />Potential contractors must have in-depth knowledge and extensive experience in evaluation design, methodology, and implementation; assessment of the potential impact of environmental conditions and/or policy issues; and strengthening evaluation capability.</p>
<p>Potential contractors must have in-depth knowledge and thorough understanding of the inner workings with educational institutions to ensure that studies benefit from the cost saving derived by joint projects and expertise from environmental/policy issues which may impact effectives of HRSA supported programs.<br /><br />Interested organizations that have the capabilities to perform the above tasks may email Ms. Diane Coger at dcoger@hrsa.gov of their interest in this requirement and indicate whether the organization is a small business; non profit; educational; or other than small business within 10 calendar days of this notice.</p>
<p>NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED AT THIS TIME. THIS NOTICE IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH ONLY.<br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTIONThis is a Sources Sought Announcement No.  A2051110016 Dated December 1, 2010.
GENERAL: The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior (DOI), is conducting a sources sought for the work described below.  This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, knowledge and abilities required to successfully complete the effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise,  that a procurement will be accomplished.  The amount of interest will determine the possibility of a set-a-side or full and open competition.  This is NOT a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  The NPS requests interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Rebecca McNeiley at Rebecca_McNeiley@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-5015 by 4:00 PM MST on Tuesday December 21, 2010.  Clearly identify your firm's size status and provide your DUNS number in your response.  Also include your geographic preference/abilities as requested below. 
The NAICS Code for this work is 113210.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Government is seeking one or more revegetation/ecological restoration/exotics control organizations to perform the following tasks:"	Provide technical assistance including planning and analysis consultation in the fields of exotics control, native plant revegetation, ecological restoration and vista management."	Provide cultural landscape revegetation restoration using native and non native species and exotic control services to include revegetation and exotics control plans."	Prepare planting sites including occasional site grading, planting bed preparation, plant provision including historic (heirloom) species when genetic considerations are not applicable."	Salvage plants from designated areas ; deliver and install seeds and plants, and collect seed and cuttings; propagate native plants from DOI genetic stocks and non-native plants as appropriate; hold and care for plants if project delays require; provide establishment care; and monitor revegetation/restoration success.
Some portion of this work may focus on Florida and the Southeast Region exotics.  Other tasks may focus on producing Gulf shore species and their installation.  The variety of the work may include roadways, parkways and landscape (including cultural landscape) revegetation restoration throughout the states listed.
Geographic Coverage: This work will be performed for the NPS units and multiple partner agencies (BLM, USFW, USFS, and others) in the Northeast, Midwest and the Southeast, including the states along the Gulf of Mexico.  Specific states covered are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, West Virginia and Wisconsin.  
TYPE and NUMBERS OF PROCUREMENT EFFORTS:  The NPS is exploring the possibility of soliciting and awarding several multiple-year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (s) to satisfy this need and is trying to determine the contractor interest, availability and expertise for this type of requirement.  We currently anticipate two separate solicitation efforts based upon geographic pools, a SouthEast & NorthEast (to include Midwest).  Each solicitation would result in one or more awards within the primary geographic IDIQ pools.  Responses shall demonstrate ability and interest in the specific states listed above.  Note that at a minimum contractor awardees will be required to meet potential work requirements/orders in all states defined in proposed geographic pools.  Six of these states have been identified as "Border States", potential for either pool (Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia & North Carolina).  Please note which pool(s) your company is qualified for and which of these "border states" you find relevant for that pool.  Your response to this sources sought will help us establish which pool the border-states will be placed in or if the two separate pools are necessary.  
This IDIQ contract will consist of (1) one base year and (4) four one-year option periods.  The guaranteed minimum amount for each contract awarded will be $25,000.00.  The estimated maximum amount will be refined with market research.  It is currently anticipated that NorthEast contracts would have an established maximum of $4-6 Million which includes the base and option years combined.  SouthEast contracts would have an established maximum of $6-15 Million which includes the base and option years combined.  Based upon results of this and additional market research the Government reserves the right to combine all states into one Eastern IDIQ pool and increase that contract maximum dollar value as appropriate.  Note that all awarded contracts would be expected to provide secondary coverage in the alternate pool states as requested.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis<br /><br /></strong>This Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information (RFI) and for planning purposes only. This is not a pre-solicitation or solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded from this notice. The Department of State will not answer any questions regarding this market research. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice. <br /><strong><br />RFI Focus<br /></strong><br />The Department of State Office of Medical Services (MED) is interested in information, specifically capabilities and functionality descriptions, from businesses that offer a COTS Ambulatory Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The EHR system will be deployed worldwide. <br /><strong><br />Background<br /><br /></strong>MED's mission is to safeguard and promote the health and well-being of America's diplomatic community. MED is centrally staffed in Washington, D.C., and has a cadre of physicians, Foreign Service (FS) Health Practitioners, nurses, and medical technologists working in health units at US Embassies and Consulates world-wide, MED provides primary medical care and support to over 50,000 Foreign Service and other US Government personnel, and their families, overseas. In addition to providing primary medical care, MED provides mental health care, coordination of local medical care, medical evacuations, and medical clearance assessments. MED has approximately 185 direct hire clinicians (70 Doctors of Medicine (MDs), 115 Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) on staff.
<p>The overseas Health Units, located in approximately 170 countries, vary in size and capabilities: <br />&#61607; Medevac Centers are typically considered a Large Health Unit and is staffed with a mix of Regional Medical Officers (RMO), Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP), Regional Medical Officers/Psychiatrists (RMO/P), locally hired Registered Nurses (RN), and administrative personnel. Regional Medevac centers coordinate medical evacuations; provide primary healthcare and administrative functions. <br />&#61607; Large Health Units are staffed with a mix of RMOs, RMO/Ps, FSHPs, and locally hired clinical personnel including RNs, possibly MDs, Medical Technologists, and Pharmacists. Large Health Units provide a full range of MED health services including primary care, local hospitalization, and regional administrative support. <br />&#61607; Medium Health Units are staffed by either a RMO or FSHP and a limited number of locally hired clinical and administrative personnel. Medium sized Health Units provide on-site primary care but often medevac hospitalizations or complex cases. <br />&#61607; Small Health Units, often a consulate or embassy in a small country, are generally staffed by a local hire RN and occasionally a local hire MD, both of whom may only be on-site on a part-time basis. Small Health Units generally provide immunizations and first aid care, and have a very low threshold for medevac. <br /><br />In addition to the overseas Health Units, MED also has small domestic Travel Health and Immunization Clinics staffed by civil service RNs with oversight from a RMO. The Travel Health and Immunization Clinics provide immunizations plus limited occupational health care in Washington, D.C. <br /><br />Overall, MED's practice environment is relatively low volume and low acuity. MED does not provide in-patient care, have a closed pharmacy formulary, nor bill for its services. <br /><strong><br />RFI - Instructions for Respondents<br /></strong><br />1. Responses should be concise and not exceed 10 pages excluding cover page and table of contents. <br />2. Font should be 12 size font Times New Roman or 10 size font Arial. <br />3. Sales brochures, videos, and other marketing information materials will not be reviewed. <br />4. Cost or price information is not solicited and will not be reviewed. <br />5. No phone calls related to this RFI will be accepted. All correspondence shall be via email. <br /><br />All responses must include the following information:<br /><br />a. Company Name<br />b. Company Address<br />c. Business Classification<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] a. Small [ ] b. Other Than Small [ ] c. Disadvantage<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] d. Women-Owned [ ] e. HubZone [ ] f. Emerging Small Business <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] g. Service Disabled Veteran [ ] h. 8(a) Small Business<br /><br />d. Commercial and Government Entity Code (CAGE)<br />e. Product and Service Code (PSC)<br />f. Current North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Codes<br />g. Point-of-Contact name, telephone number, and email address<br /><strong><br />Capabilities<br /><br /></strong>1. Provide a summary of your company's relevant experience in conducting business with a Federal Agency.<br />2. Describe your company's approach to implementing an Ambulatory EHR system in MED's global enterprise environment as described above. Please specifically address constraints such as limited bandwidth and high latency network environments. <br />3. Provide a summary of how your company's system would address documenting non-FDA approved immunizations and/or medications. <br />4. Discuss your company's experience and/or approach with providing a modular yet scalable solution to your customers. <br />5. Please discuss any relevant implementation lessons learned and best practices.<br />6. Discuss how your Ambulatory EHR system allows for protection of data and role based access controls (e.g. Mental Health data is stored separately on its own and accessed only by Mental Health providers). <br />7. Describe how your Ambulatory EHR system is compliant with FISMA and NIST 800-53 standards.<br />8. Discuss how your company meets the Meaningful Use criteria and your current and planned Health Information Exchange capabilities. Specifically comment on immunization registry exchange.<br />9.

<SOLNBR>CP-12-01-10-01
<RESPDATE>121510
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 8040-00-NIB-0019<br />Name: Disposable Permanent Adhesive Tape Dispenser<br />Description: Dispenser, permanent adhesive tape, disposable, 3.5"L x .75"W x 2"H - Disposable permanent adhesive tape produced with post consumer recycled material. Ergonomic dispenser neatly applies a film of glue exactly where it is needed. Replaces glue sticks and messy liquid glue. Smooth, even adhesive tape is acid free. Size is 3.5"L x .75"W x 2"H and unit of issue is each (EA).</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Kansas City, MO.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 8040-00-NIB-0019<br />Similar Items: PRI-00-20725, PRI-10-00740-0, TOM-62114, SPR-86258</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 15, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis only. This is NOT a solicitation request for proposals or quotations. The purpose of this survey is to obtain information regarding the future Air Force Medical Service Support Agency (AFMSA) Hospital Aseptic Management Services (HAMS) Requirement.
<p>The United States Air Force is conducting market research via the linked Survey that will be used to assess the ability of companies to perform Hospital Aseptic Management Services (HAMS) for the Air Force. <br /><br />The survey is being administered for the USAF by Monterey Consultants, Inc. Monterey is a provider of business consulting services related to the federal government. <br /><br />Data collected from the survey will become the property of the United States Air Force, and will be used to provide a snapshot of how businesses who participated in the survey are capable of performing various areas of HAMS. The data will not be shared with any entity outside of the Air Force. Monterey has signed, Non-Disclosure Agreements in place and is constrained under Organizational Conflict of Interest clauses. Monterey is not engaged in the medical services industry and does not plan on doing business within that area in the foreseeable future. <br /><br />Neither Monterey nor the Air Force claim or suggest that participation in this year's survey will result in consideration/award of a federal contract. Participation in the survey is entirely voluntary and non-participation will not affect the Air Force's consideration of any company for future federal contracts. The survey will close at 3:00 PM, Central Standard Time (CST) on 6 Jan 2011.<br /><br />This survey is internet-based and does not require any special equipment or software beyond a typical web browser-capable computer. The survey should take no longer than approximately 20 - 30 minutes to complete. To participate, visit the following website: http://www.mcix.com/survey<br />(This is the link for the testing of the current survey draft only. It will<br />change when the approved survey goes live.)<br /><br />Questions about the survey should be directed to Monterey Survey Response Group email address cited below.&nbsp;<br /><br /> <a href="mailto:survey@mcix.com">survey@mcix.com</a><br /><br />Thank you for your participation.</p>

<CONTACT>Virginia S. Hennings, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-601-9447, Fax 703-601-9473, Email virginia.hennings@ssp.navy.mil
<DESC><br />1.0 Description
<p>1.1 The Department of the Navy, Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) is seeking information on how an interested party could provide automatic testing hardware and software to evaluate&nbsp;both copper and fiber optic cables.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. The RFI responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFPs, if any are issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />SSP oversees the development and deployment of the TRIDENT II Fleet Ballistic Missile Strategic Weapons System (SWS) onboard the Navy's SSBN submarines. The subsystems of the SWS are connected by various cables comprised of copper conductors and fiber optics, which need to be tested and certified to Navy, Shipyard, and SSP standards.</p>
<p>Hardware with both copper conductor and fiber optic testing capabilities in a single unit is the goal, but alternatives will be considered.</p>
<p>2.1 Planned Production: The projected need is for twelve identical units initially.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period: All twelve units and user documentation would be required to be delivered to SSP approximately one year after a procurement contract is awarded.</p>
<p>2.3 Limitations: Options may be exercised to procure additional units should the need arise.</p>
<p>2.4 Security Requirements:</p>
<p>No classified data will be processed on this system.</p>
<p>Hardware and software would need to demonstrably comply with SSP Information Assurance (IA) requirements standards, as described in Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 8500.2, generally for Platform Information Technology (PIT) equipment.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information<br />The following sections list a number of capabilities that are particular to automatic cable testing in the SSBN environment. Where general requirements are given, they should not be construed as absolute constraints or specifications.</p>
<p>The responses to the areas listed below should not only address the specific capabilities but list alternatives, improvements, exceptions, and the context in which the capabilities may be evaluated. With any hardware and software, there are functional and performance trade-offs to be made and these should be explained concisely with a detailed description of possible product non-compliance.</p>
<p>3.1 General<br />Overall physical parameters determine the ability of the tester to be used efficiently in a submarine environment. The unit will generally be used in a shipyard environment. The following capabilities should be addressed:<br />- Copper conductor and fiber optic cable testing capabilities in a single enclosure<br />- Compact design without connecting cables (except external power) or protuberances<br />- Compactness<br />- Weight<br />- Portability<br />- Maintainability<br />- Environmental (temperature, humidity, etc.) constraints<br />- Ruggedness<br />- Ease of use<br />- User Interface<br />- Primary power and back-up power<br />- Military-style connectors<br />- Use of Off-the-Shelf equipment<br />- Techniques to help extend the useful life of the tester<br />- Time for test setup and execution<br />- EMI</p>
<p>3.2 Copper Conductor Testing<br />This portion of the tester's capabilities may include:<br />- Resistance measurement / Continuity checks<br />- Leakage current using high-voltage DC<br />- Measurements referenced to and isolated from ship's ground<br />- Number of test points<br />- Single-ended testing (far end of a cable not easily accessible to the tester)<br />- Use of loop-back plugs, test plugs, or similar at the far end<br />- Determining which end of the cable has a short, open, or misswire<br />- Capacitance and other electrical/test parameters</p>
<p>3.3 Fiber Optic Testing<br />This portion of the tester's capabilities may include:<br />- Multi-mode and Single-mode fibers<br />- Frequency/Wavelength selection<br />- End-to-end attenuation and evaluated to allocated loss analysis<br />- Insertion loss in both directions<br />- Simultaneous multiple-fiber testing<br />- Single-ended testing (far end of a cable not easily accessible to the tester)<br />- Requirements of MIL-STD-2042, Revision B, specifically Coupled Power Ratio (CPR)<br />- Anticipation of future requirements of MIL-STD-2042, Revision C<br />- Identification of fault location</p>
<p>3.4 Software<br />The software generally controls the tester hardware and supports the user interface. Considerations include:<br />- Type and availability of Operating System<br />- Ease of bug fixes and feature upgrades<br />- Control of the sequencing of test functions<br />- Multiplexing of test points<br />- Measuring the test parameters <br />- Flexibility (ability of the user to program the sequencing of measurements and test points)<br />- Operational speed <br />- Interface to existing comprehensive databases of parameters<br />- Providing essential data to the user, including guidance and prompts<br />- Archival of test data<br />- Built-in Tests<br />- Calibration interface<br />- Data mining applications<br />- Source code availability</p>
<p>3.5 User Interfaces<br />This may address the "ease of use" issue above:<br />- Use with a gloved hand(s)<br />- Small printer for quick verification records<br />- External data retrieval</p>
<p>3.6 Proposed Capabilities<br />Any additional features that might be useful should be listed, including potential future upgrades.</p>
<p>The economic and technological trade-offs may be examined to help decide which features may add value to the system.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI&nbsp;with a white paper.</p>

Even if another vendor did make like material, the laboratory could not them them because CAP will not accredit the lab using another vendor's survey material.<BR><BR>This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include complete and detailed technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price, and delivery time.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP), intends to issue a cost-plus fixed-fee contract for the development of an FDA approved Bench-top Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Diagnostic Assay System, a Point-of-Care TBI Diagnostic Assay System, and a Hand-held (for example, Lateral Flow Strip Based) TBI Diagnostic Assay System.  Successful contractor performance must include validated Phase I and Phase II human data for at least two biomarkers with at least one of the two biomarkers demonstrating the following ability: to detect severe TBI via patient blood serum with a specificity of at least 90% and a sensitivity of at least 80% within 6 hours of injury; to detect a mild TBI via patient serum with a specificity of at least 90% and a sensitivity of at least 75% within 6 hours of injury; and to predict mortality in severe TBI patients with a specificity of greater than 95% and a sensitivity of at least 80% within 12 hours after injury. The biomarker S100B will not be considered due to the nature of military trauma which involves multiple injuries to tissues and organs that can release S100B and thus confound its specificity as a marker of brain trauma. The major tasks for this contract will be to establish clinical trial centers for the pivotal trial; prepare an application to the FDA for Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) of a Bench-top TBI Diagnostic Assay System; to initiate and obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals with trial sites and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Human Research Protections Office; to perform the pivotal trial on the Bench-top TBI Diagnostic Assay System; to develop GMP manufacturing methods for reagents required for the pivotal trial; and to obtain FDA regulatory approval for a Point-of-Care TBI Diagnostic Assay System as well as a Hand-held TBI Diagnostic Assay System for use by military medics on the battlefield.  The key deliverables for this contract are a successful pivotal trial and PMA filing with the FDA to achieve FDA clearance for the proposed contractor's biomarker assays performed on the Bench-top TBI Diagnostic Assay System and eventually for a Point-of-Care TBI Diagnostic Assay System and a Hand-held TBI Diagnostic Assay System.  <BR><BR>PROPOSED MODIFICATION: The Statement of Work is being modified to utilize 40 testing sites rather than 30.  This modification will allow for faster patient enrollment which in turn is estimated to speed up the scheduled completion of the clinical trial by approximately 6 months.  This schedule improvement is advantageous to the Government because it provides a lacking critical technology to the warfighter sooner than projected.  The impact of receiving this technology early is evident in its intended role by improving the quality of care given to soldiers, possibly saving lives, and reducing overall costs of treatment.<BR><BR>USAMRAA intends to negotiate this contract on a sole source basis with Banyan Biomarkers, Inc in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <BR><BR>This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Competing this requirement and awarding to any other manufacturer and system would result in substantial delays and disruption of several key projects already in progress and would also increase the overall cost to the government.  <BR>Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Government's requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  <BR><BR>Questions and comments pertaining to this procurement shall be emailed to Craig.E.Anderson@amedd.army.mil.

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>(1) Technical Capability</p>
<p>(a) Technical Approach<br />The technical approach will be evaluated based on the information contained in the technical proposal that demonstrates the degree of the Contractor's understanding of the requirements, including the soundness of the Contractor's proposed methodology to effectively meet and comply with the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW). <br />(2) Staffing Plan <br />NIST will evaluate the offeror's proposed staffing plan rationale and the resumes of the proposed key personnel to determine the extent to which their background, education, work experience, and accomplishments demonstrate their ability to effectively perform the requirements of the performance work statement <br /><br />(3) Past Performance<br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. <br />In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness and ability to control cost and schedule of past work to determine the quality of service, and the extent to which the offeror has performed work of a similar type, magnitude and complexity. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance.<br />(4) PRICE <br />The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored. The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed prices shall be entirely compatible with the technical quotations. <br />Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored.

<DESC>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMAG000-11-02182.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement will be set aside for small business if qualified responses are received. The associated NAICS code is 541990. The small business size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:<br />The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) in Norman, Oklahoma intends to negotiate with only one source, Lockheed Martin Corporation located in Moorestown, New Jersey for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) engineering, technical and computer support maintenance services for the SPY-1A phased array radar to include technical and computer program support services in troubleshooting, repairing, and testing of SPY-1A and related equipment system interfaces to facilitate NSSL operations and testing efforts; equipment maintenance; configuration management support, and training for SPY-1A equipment operation and casualty recovery. The NSSL and a consortium of ten organizations, including the FAA, Department of Navy, and the University of Oklahoma constructed the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT) in Norman, Oklahoma to adapt and develop the phased array radar for weather applications. For its part, the US Navy loaned a battle spare SPY-1A phased array radar to the NSSL. The SPY-1A technology was obtained for the NWRT because of the ability for rapid scans. It is anticipated that adapting this technology for weather purposes can increase warning times by as much as 70 percent. Using multiple beams and frequencies that are controlled electronically, the SPY-1A's phased array radar reduces the scan time of severe weather from six minutes for NEXRAD radar to only one minute. Per the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Navy and the FAA, NOAA is required to maintain the radar in good battle ready operating condition for the duration of the loan. In order to maintain the equipment in this battle ready state and meet the requirements of the MOA, maintenance services and replacement parts are required from Lockheed Martin. As the original SPY-1A equipment designer and manufacturer for the Navy, Lockheed Martin has extensive experience and background in the design/development, production and integration, operation and maintenance for the SPY-1A radar. They are also the only known manufacturer of the parts for the SPY-1A radar and the only one capable of providing the spare parts. The SPY-1A equipment and technology is proprietary only to Lockheed Martin, which was developed and engineered for the Navy. Due to the unique capability of Lockheed Martin to provide the needed services and supplies in support of the continued operation of the SPY-1A in NWRT, there is no other one responsible source other than Lockheed Martin. NSSL's agreement to maintain the system in battle readiness requires contract support services from Lockheed Martin. The proposed contract is for a one-year period. This notice represents the only official notice of a solicitation.</p>
<p>(VI) Other offerors must provide documentation that confirms ability and access to work on and provide spare parts for the SPY-1 radar.</p>

Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your quote. Call 1-888-227-2423 or on the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov  for more information. Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your proposal: 52.247-34 F.O.B Destination. Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the Offeror that meets the solicitations minimum criteria for (i) technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement (ii) past performance at the lowest (iii) price.
 Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  Only those offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to the following:  Offerors must furnish documentation that adequately demonstrates the vendors ability to provide the two 48kw Battery Systems in accordance with the critical features.  Such documentation can be existing literature, previous or similar builds of various battery systems, engineering designs, inspection records, certification records, or any other documentation literature that demonstrates the vendors ability to produce the required items.
  Documentation must include a list of equipment used for manufacturing the Battery Systems.  Vendor must demonstrate ability to meet the required delivery date of 8 weeks after receipt of order.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:  NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.
  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  OUTSTANDING:  Very little to not potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offerors past performance.  SATISFACTORY:  Little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.  MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 9.104, in order to validate responsibility, the Offeror must furnish sufficient information that demonstrates that the Offeror has the necessary manufacturing equipment, inspection sources, tools and other materials and resources to fabricate the required gages and meet the required delivery schedule.
 In addition, the vendor is provide copies of applicable commercially published price lists pertaining to your companys products that meet the specifications, along with applicable government discounts. All offerors shall provide cage code, Dunn and Bradstreet number, tax identification number and also complete an electronic Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>

Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than <br />DEC 13, 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time.

ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURES
 
Prior to acceptance of the goods or services provided under this contract, inspection and testing will be performed by VA Asset Management Service, Textile Care Quality Assurance Specialist's in accordance with this clause.  For purposes of determining the payment due date under this contract, and for no other purpose, the date of acceptance of the goods or services provided under this contract shall be the actual date of acceptance by the Government or the number of days after request for inspection indicated herein, whichever is earlier, provided delay in acceptance is not the fault of the contractor.

(a)	Upon completion of installation the equipment will be turned over to the hospital for use.  The contractor shall furnish, upon completion of installation, a written notice of readiness for inspection to the Contracting Officer, VA Medical Center, Brockton, MA.  The VA Medical Center, Brockton will pay all costs associated with the original inspection.  Final acceptance of the equipment and installation will be based upon an inspection and test to be performed at Government expense within thirty (30) calendar days from date of receipt of request for inspection.  If equipment passes inspection or if acceptance inspection is not conducted within thirty (30) calendar days from date of receipt of request for inspection, the Government shall accept installation with guarantee date commencing with date of receipt of notification for inspection.  Use of the equipment during the period between completion of installation and inspection and/or inspection and reinspection shall not negate the right on the part of the Government to reject the equipment, should it fail, nor to preclude default action against the contractor in the event of failure to correct deficiencies.

(b)	In the event the equipment is rejected, contractor will be advised as to deficiencies which were cause for rejection.  It shall be contractor's responsibility to correct reported deficiencies and to advise the Contracting Officer when all corrections have been made and equipment is ready for re-inspection.  Re-inspection(s) will be performed by VA Asset Management Service, Textile Care Quality Assurance Specialist's with all costs incurred chargeable to the contractor's account.

(c)	If deficiencies found at the time of inspection are corrected within fourteen (14) calendar days from date of notice of rejection, date of acceptance will be the date notice of readiness for the original inspection is received by the Contracting Officer.  If corrections are not accomplished within 14 days, the guarantee commencement date shall then be the date notice of readiness for reinspection is received by the Contracting Officer preceding final acceptance.

(d)	If acceptance has been made and guarantee period established due to the failure of the Government to perform the inspection within the specified time, this does not waive the rights of the Government to perform an inspection (at the Government's expense) nor does it waive the right of the Government to perform reinspections, if deficiencies are noted, with costs incurred chargeable to the contractor's account.  Acceptance of the equipment due to the failure of the Government to perform the inspection within the specified time shall not negate the right on the part of the Government to exercise its rights under the Termination for Cause provisions of the contract in the event the contractor fails to correct the reported deficiencies.

EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.	Technical Capability.  The Government will evaluate how well the proposed system design meets the requirement as described in the specifications.  The Government will evaluate this capability on the basis of information obtained from the offeror, such as descriptive literature and the technical proposal.  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.  Ability to provide functions that are not required by the specifications but described as "preferred" may increase an offer's rating for this factor.  

2.	Price.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed price.

3.	Quality/Past Performance.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's reputation for quality and past performance.  By quality and past performance the Government means the offeror's reputation for conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's reputation for adherence to contract schedules, including both technical and administrative aspects of performance.  The Government will evaluate quality/past performance on the basis of information that may be obtained from the offeror, such as previous commercial and Government contracts.  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.

4.	Work plan.  Phasing of the work and schedule for completion are important factors that will be evaluated.  Production down time must be kept to a minimum.  Bidder's ability to keep the laundry up and running to the maximum extent is an important consideration.  Likewise, time is of the essence.  Bidder's ability to furnish and install the new equipment in a timely fashion is an important consideration as well.

(b)	The individual factors are considered to be of equal importance; therefore the non-price factors of technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price.  

(c)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

TIME OF DELIVERY

Delivery shall be made within 120 calendar days after award.  The required delivery date will be annotated on each individual delivery order.  Delivery dates specified on delivery orders may be adjusted by the contracting officer to coincide with the date the hospital will be ready to receive installation.  The contracting officer will advise the contractor of the new delivery date at least 45 days prior to the original or adjusted delivery dates.

Truck Delivery:  Truck delivery is accepted 8:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., local time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.

Weekend installation is preferred.   Installation site will be available for work to be performed under the contract from 12 Noon Friday to 6:00 a.m. Monday, local time, excluding Federal Holidays.

GUARANTEE

The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of one year, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government.  The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material which are found to be defective during the guarantee period.  Replacement of material and parts shall be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States.  Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.

SERVICE

(a) Service during the guarantee period shall be provided within 24 hours of notice from the Chief, Acquisition and Materiel Management Service or his/her designated representative.  A routine service request will be issued upon any failure which degrades system performance but does not prevent continuation of patient care.

(b) Emergency service by a qualified technician must be provided within 24 hours of notification.  Telephone response does not satisfy this requirement.  An emergency service request will be issued upon any failure which prevents systems operation and disrupts continued patient care. 

(c) Prior to and during the guarantee period, service at other than normal working hours (8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., excluding weekends and holidays), if at the request of the hospital, will be charged at an hourly rate which is the difference between current regular rate and overtime rate.  Otherwise, all services shall be performed at no charge to the Government during this period.

AVAILABILITY OF PARTS AND SERVICE

The contractor guarantees availability of servicing and replacement parts for a period of ten (10) years.  

TRAINING OF OPERATING PERSONNEL

(a) The price quoted shall include contractor responsibility for providing on-site orientation and training of using personnel in operation and care of the equipment furnished.  This training shall include actual demonstration and operation of the equipment, preventive maintenance, and any adjustments or other actions which may be undertaken by operating personnel in the event of failure of equipment, provided that such adjustment or action will in no way jeopardize the Government's rights under contract guarantee clause.  Upon completion of installation, this training shall be given by qualified contractor representatives.  Operator and maintenance training shall not be conducted concurrently.

(b) The contractor shall consult with Mr. Allan Covell. (774) 826-1945, or person acting in that capacity regarding the time this training will begin.  That official will be responsible for arranging for the presence of personnel to be trained.  

PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE CONTRACT CHANGES

The Contracting Officer is the ONLY individual authorized to approve any change in the contract which shall result in an increase or decrease of the contract price or which shall in any way change the terms or conditions of the contract.

<SUBJECT>81--Amendment 1.
<SOLNBR>N0024411T0033
<CONTACT>Shannon La Com 562-626-7104
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions.

1. Is the winch to pull propeller and stand onto pallet then stop it from moving too fast/far while stand is on pallet OR is winch to pull propeller and stand onto pallet then control propeller and stand while rolling off pallet?

Answer: The Winch will pull the propeller if manual pushing would be hazardous or too heavy. The winch will be a stop it also if needed. So, the function of the winch will serve both. 

2. Are you sure you want aluminum for this pallet or will you accept a like material (i.e. stainless steel)?

Answer: Aluminum is required.

3. What is the physical weight of the propeller? Are we correct in understanding that the load capacity will never exceed 2,000 lb?

Answer: The propeller assembly weighs about 800 to 900 lbs.
 Plus the stand which is about 500 to 600 lbs. The total load of the propeller and stand is approximately 2,000 lbs. The 2,000 lbs load capacity is initially stated as the minimum. The ideal maximum load is 3,000 lbs.   

4. Do you want the drawing certified by a professional engineer?

Answer: Yes. 

5. Does the railing need to be made to OSHA Building Code, i.e., 42" high with toe plate?

Answer: Yes. 

6. Is there any preference for using diamond tread plate or smooth plate for top and ramp?

Answer: Application of non-skid on the surface is the most ideal for this project. 

7. What does the stand look like, how many wheels does it have and what is the wheel spacing?

Answer: The attached image is the actual stands that will hold the propellers.
 

8. If winch is mounted on corner with pulley in center to allow access when forks are in place, does that pose any problems for users or will they not need access to the winch when forklift is being used so that it can be mounted in the center between fork openings?

Answer: The winch must be mounted in the back corner of the pallet to allow personnel to safely access and operate from the side while the pallet is fork-lifted and suspended on the appropriate elevation leveled to the flat bed truck. 

9. What is the center-to-center spacing width of the forks?

Answer: The fork-lift points must have enough room for the forks and in proportional location that will be balanced. The forks are adjustable/movable from side-to-side.
 It will adjust accordingly to where the fork-lift points are placed. 

The date and time for submission remains unchanged.

<DESC>Project Description: Construction pre-solicitation for the FY10 Congressional Add MCA PN059978/329828, Analytical Chemistry Wing (11,500 SF) and Administrative Area Addition (14,500 SF) to the Advanced Chemical Laboratory, Edgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.<br /><br />Construct a state-of-the-art advanced analytical chemistry wing for work with supertoxic chemical agents and toxins with associated data reduction space and administrative space. Construction will be phased to keep the existing labs, which contain supertoxic chemical agents, operational. The contractor will be required to work around these labs during construction. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is provided from a central plant. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; information systems; and site improvements. APG needs to construct an Advanced Chemistry Lab to meet its current mission. Current facilities are inadequate and now require impermeable surfaces, special chemical hoods with ultra-efficient carbon filtration, and extensive electrical backup systems. Safety and environmental controls are paramount to ensure that personnel and the environment are protected against these supertoxic and lethal materials. Design analysis prepared for this project indicates that significant experience with highly toxic and surety laboratory construction is necessary to support the successful completion of construction of this project within the established constraints. Additionally, the project includes significant renovation of existing laboratory and administrative spaces while maintaining daily function and mission requirements within the facility.<br /><br />The proposed procurement is unrestricted. NAICS: 236220 with a business size standard of $33.5 million. Estimated cost of services is between $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00. <br /><br />The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge on or about November 23 2010, to all authenticated account holders of Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System. Please note that all Corps of Engineers acquisitions are considered sensitive, but unclassified documents and require users to have valid MPIN entered in the FBO systems to access package.<br /><br />The media through which the Government chooses to issue this solicitation will be the Internet only. This solicitation will not be issued in paper. No phone or fax request for copy of solicitation will be accepted. Proposals can be submitted after the solicitation announcement by mail to: <br /><br />U. S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Attn: CENAB-CT<br />Contracting Division <br />P. O.

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:

* Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
* Compensation and Pension (C&P)
* Education
* Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
* Insurance
* Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task order proposal requests (TOPRs) against this IDIQ contract. Each TOPR will be evaluated based on a price proposal, past performance information and a technical/management plan, then a TO will be subsequently awarded to the ID/IQ Contractor whose TOPR proposal provides best value to the Government.  Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided in the solicitation. TOPRs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12-month options. The solicitation will be issued on or about December 10, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about December 27, 2010.

Proposals can be submitted under one or multiple topics and must be clearly stated so within the proposal. The BAA allows for multiple awards. Each award will have a period of performance of up to twenty-four months. VA intends to maximize use of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contracts resulting from this BAA; however, offerors may propose alternate contract types providing that the alternative is supported in the proposal.
The Government is not entertaining pre-proposal meetings and/or pre-proposal discussions.  Specific questions may be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer and all questions and responses will be posted here via amendments and at the VAi2 website.  It is not at the Government's discretion to determine if and where innovative ideas fall within the BAA. 
Information from the June 16th Webinar is attached here and at the VAi2 website at www.va.gov/vai2. 
This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this BAA. No contract award(s) will be made unless funds are available.
The point of contact for any questions related to BAA may be addressed to Ms. Lauren Oliver, Contract Specialist, email: Lauren.Oliver@va.gov and Mrs. Carol Newcomb, Contracting Officer, email: Carol.Newcomb@va.gov.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) has issued the VA Innovation Initiative (VAi2) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Industry Innovation Competition (Industry-IC), see attached file. The Industry-IC invites interested contractors to contribute ideas (within the topics of this BAA) for innovations that increase Veteran access to VA services, reduce or control costs of delivering those services, enhance the performance of VA operations and improve the quality of service that Veterans and their families receive. 
Proposals can be submitted to vai2baa@va.gov during the life of the BAA. The BAA is open until September 30 and while proposals may be submitted any time up to that date, in order to make project awards before the end of the fiscal year (September 30), VA will begin the evaluation process on July 6. Evaluations will be conducted on a rolling basis and awards will continue until available funds have expired. It is VA's intent to finish as much of the selection process as possible by early August.

<DESC>Note: The Government continues to see a strong response to the Industry Innovation Competition BAA and is well into the evaluation process that began in July. Given the volume of responses and our desire to award the strongest proposals within the current fiscal year, the Government strongly encourages submission of proposals by August 20th. Proposals submitted by this date have the best chance of being awarded in FY10. The BAA remains open through September 30th; proposals submitted after the 20th will be evaluated in FY11 against any remaining funds.
