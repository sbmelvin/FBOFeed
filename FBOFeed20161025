<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-17-00322 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-17-00481 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. 
Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting office. Interested parties are invited to contact the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR 52.209-1.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALFICATION.  For qualification information/source approval request contact Jennifer Bugler, DLA-Aviation/AOB at extension (405) 736-3208.  
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source contract to Omega Performance Corporation, 4301 N Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA 22203. This will be a new contract and not a renewal of an existing requirement.<br /><br />The products offered by Omega alone met the totality and scope of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) training requirements. The material is covered in a logical and comprehensive way and with a methodology that is uniquely consistent with OCC's credit analysis approach. <br /><br />In January 2016, a leading Subject Matter Expert (SME) reviewed Omega's eLearning training products re-affirming that Omega's products serve the OCC's credit analysis curriculum effectively. The Omega Credit Analysis, Commercial &amp; Industrial (C&amp;I), and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) content provides the required coverage of basic to more advanced credit analysis of C&amp;I and CRE loans. Omega is widely recognized as a leading credit analysis training brand in the financial services industry.<br /><br />Over many years, the OCC has used Omega products, requiring the Loan Documentation self-study as a pre-requisite for all new examiners prior to taking the Credit Fundamentals course. The OCC has also regularly purchased a supply of other Omega credit self-studies in past years, including Financial Accounting for Lenders, Commercial Loans to Small Business, Commercial Real Estate Loan Analysis, and Understanding Personal Cash Flow.<br /><br />Omega's courses meet the training requirements vetted through the Commercial Credit Examiner Development Advisory Committee (EDAG) and will meet needs across OCC examination business lines, including training teams, and newly hired as well as more experienced examiners in Midsize Community Bank Supervision (MCBS) and Large Bank Supervision. In addition, Omega's eLearning credit training content will effectively close gaps in loan analysis training identified by a national working group that included MCBS Credit Lead Experts. It will also provide foundational and progressively advanced credit evaluation skill build-up consistent with OCC's loan analytical framework and methods.<br /><br />The period of performance for this requirement is anticipated as October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 with four, one-year options.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued. All information received within seven (7) calendar days after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC. Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department), Office of Migrant Education (OME) is seeking a contractor with the capability to support the procurement titled: the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) Development and Maintenance. As part of its mission, OME uses MSIX to support the exchange of migrant student records from one school district to another as migrant students move within State or across State lines. This investment is in response to the Congressional mandate in Section 1308(b) of Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended. Section 1308(b) requires the Secretary to assist States in developing effective methods for electronically exchanging student records amongst States; and, to determine, and accurately account for, the number of migratory children in each State. The MSIX investment consists of a responsive web-based platform that links States' migrant student record databases to facilitate the national exchange of migrant students' educational and health information.<br />The MSIX investment has four goals. These goals include exchanging education and health data; promoting the use of MSIX; ensuring the utilization of the consolidated records for enrollment, placement, and credit accrual, as well as producing national data on the migrant population. The primary beneficiaries of MSIX investments are the migrant students and State Migrant Education Program (MEP) grantees. <br />Because MSIX is a comprehensive technology platform and a major investment for the Department, the scope encompasses Contractor support to provide Project Management, System Operations, Cyber Security Management, Customer Support Help Desk, Issue Tracking and Trouble Ticket Management, Asset Management, State Support and Technical Assistance for MSIX. The MSIX Contractor shall provide overall program oversight, analysis, and recommendations to the Department to ensure the quality of the design, development, and operation of MSIX and related deliverables through the Lifecycle Management (LCM) of the program. To achieve these goals the contractor shall meet the following objectives:
<p>a) Ensure the MSIX remains fully functional and stable (e.g. bug-fixes, security upgrades, software patches), and complete all required system, hardware and software upgrades in a timely manner. Note: all upgrades or enhancements shall be coordinated with the Department.<br />b) Interface daily with MSIX users and other MSIX personnel via the MSIX Help Desk to maintain a high quality of support for MSIX. Responsibilities shall include system usage training for users, and rapid response to all technical problems reported to the Contractor by users or by MSIX staff.<br />c) Be expected to install and maintain all MSIX software and hardware components and keep track of them via an automated reporting and tracking tool (Note: The Contractor should include the tracking tool in the proposal and describe its features and functionality.) <br />d) Perform Help Desk Support &amp; Trouble Ticket Management tasks required to meet expected service levels and to support the end users of the MSIX. <br />e) Meet related system security and privacy requirements.<br />f) Support the Department's initiated MSIX staff training initiatives.<br />g) Adhere to all Federal Government, Department of Education regulations, directives and standards related to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), Privacy Act, Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-130 and A-123, among other applicable policies.</p>
<p>The Department anticipates the release of the subject solicitation during the week of October 31, 2016.</p>
<p>It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101 and will be solicited as a Request for Proposal (RFP) through FBO. This procurement will be awarded in accordance with procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.1 (Acquisition of Commercial Items - General) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation).

<DESC>This is a market survey for the Enterprise Information Display System (E-IDS) Program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request For Proposal (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not currently seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of meeting the service delivery requirements associated with the E-IDS program.  The attached documents are for information gathering purposes and to highlight the current operational concept and functional and performance requirements for E-IDS:

	Market Survey Questionnaire
	Preliminary Program Requirements Document (pPRD) 
	Concept of Operations (ConOps) 
	Preliminary Alternatives Decision Document

The E-IDS program received a positive Joint Resource Council (JRC) Investment Analysis Readiness Decision (IARD) in June 2016, and was granted authorization to conduct investment analysis toward an Initial Investment Decision (IID) in 2017. Proceeding further with a planned Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2018, E-IDS is scheduled to complete the systems Key Site Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in the 2021/2022 timeframe. The responses to this market survey may or may not result in scheduling individual meetings with one or more qualified vendors in the industry and the E-IDS Program Office beginning around the 1st week of December 2016.

BACKGROUND: 

In the National Airspace System (NAS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) personnel rely on a variety of decision support tools and sources of information to perform their jobs. Controllers use their primary radar displays to monitor air traffic and operational information; Traffic Managers depend on automation and displays that help them to identify and resolve operational constraints and ensure efficient flows; Front Line Managers (FLMs) use a combination of these systems to ensure controllers in their operational areas are aware of the latest operational conditions; and Operational Managers (OMs) use a combination all of these displays to monitor their facilities. These systems focus on dynamic, more timely information. 

However, operational personnel often need information in addition to their primary display (e.g., radar display, Traffic Situation Display (TSD), oceanic display) to assist in operational situations they encounter. Some of this information is dynamic, such as local weather conditions and equipment status.  Other information changes infrequently and is essentially static, such as operational procedures, letters of agreement, and aircraft characteristics. The display of this information is provided through what is generally referred to as Information Display Systems (IDSs). IDSs are separate from primary displays, and their purpose is to provide Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs), FLMs, and Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) with supplemental but operationally essential information for controlling aircraft.

IDSs were introduced in the terminal domain in the 1990s, and many are relying on obsolete technology and interfaces with facility-centric, inefficient data organization and manual update methods.  Access to trusted information sources varies from facility to facility depending upon the type of IDS model and whether the facility has a direct interface to source data.  The Terminal environment includes four distinct systems, each with different hardware/software configurations. En Route includes a system that provides non-tactical information to FAA personnel in the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). The Traffic Flow domain is present in both the Terminal and En Route environments, and consists of large monitors that display real-time, high-level traffic and Traffic Flow Management (TFM) information. The Alaska ARTCC has also developed its own IDS, which is unique in the NAS.

In some cases, vendor-supplied information may be the only source available.  These limitations make it cumbersome for users to search, retrieve, and display information.  It also adds to the workload of both controllers who use the systems and data managers who maintain the systems.  Having multiple types of information retrieval and display systems creates inefficient maintenance activities necessary to sustain all of the system variations.  Because each system is separate and facility-bound, there is no centralized data backup, data migration, or data recovery capability. 

The Enterprise Information Display System (E-IDS) will provide an enterprise-level platform that replaces multiple types of IDSs in the NAS, including EnRoute, Terminal, Traffic Flow and Offshore domains at over 500 facilities with common hardware and software. E-IDS will eliminate differences in the information displayed by obtaining it from trusted sources through a portal that supplies the NAS with all types of aggregated data from multiple sources. E-IDS will be an integrated system with common hardware and software that uses a common enterprise-based server to collect, store, update, and provide information from authoritative sources to thousands of client displays in the field rather than having each IDS collect, store and update its own information. The FAA will require full unlimited data rights for E-IDS. 

Since current IDSs are incapable of capitalizing on NextGen capabilities, E-IDS, with its enterprise-level platform, will leverage NextGen capabilities and provide secure, timely, and accurate information to all service providers.  E-IDS will also add system displays at Oceanic controller positions in ARTCCs and for Tech Ops personnel, which do not currently exist. Incorporating new technology will improve the safety of the NAS and the efficiency of flight-specific ATC operations by providing faster access to specific information by each IDS.  

E-IDS SCOPE

The description of current alternatives includes alternative-specific assumptions; hardware components and configurations and software approach; interfaces; bandwidth considerations; and maintenance approach.  

The E-IDS system will:
	Combine duplicate management activities under an overarching program
	Provide capabilities needed to meet NextGen era technologies that cannot be met by todays IDSs 
	Provide efficient data access and data management that is not possible with aging IDS systems
	Interface with and display data to the ATCs from multiple legacy systems including weather and surface systems

Alternatives for E-IDS include but are not limited to: 
	New commercial off the shelf (COTS) IT infrastructure and new modified commercially available software (CAS) or
	Cloud computing services with remote thin client displays connected to high reliability networks at central facilities

The following minimum information will be displayed on E-IDS:
	Dynamic Information
o	Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)
o	Special Activity Airspace (SAA)-Schedule and Status
o	Pilot Reports (PIREPS)
o	Weather reports
o	Wind reports	
o	Tower sensor data
o	Traffic Management Initiatives (Ground/Departure Stops, Snow Removal, Miles in Trail, etc.)
	Static Information
o	Charts
o	Approach Plates
o	FAA Orders
o	Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
o	Letters of Agreement (LOAs)

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract to The Boeing Company (Boeing), Seattle, WA, on an other than full and open basis procuring for the first P-8A flight test aircraft developed and built (hereafter referred to as "Test Aircraft T-1" or "the aircraft"): (1) aircraft depot maintenance; (2) depot In-Service-Repair (ISR); and (3) validation of the Draft P-8A Integrated Maintenance Plan Depot Specification (IMPDS). Pursuant to DFARS 206.302-1(d) and PGI 206.302, a Sources Sought Notice was posted for this requirement on 30 October 2015.
<p>The effort shall be procured pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." On 14 June 2004, Boeing was awarded the P-8A System Development and Demonstration Contract N00019-04-C-3146 under a best value limited competition. The P-8A weapons system consists of a basic 737-800 ERX air vehicle modified to meet Navy requirements, to include systems and subsystems for avionics, communications, mission, and weapon capabilities. Boeing is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the P-8A and its sole integrator. Test Aircraft T-1 was the first P-8A developed and built. Its configuration is unique (one-of-a-kind). It is scheduled to be delivered (via DD Form 250) to the Government on or about October 2016. The aircraft is outfitted with test instrumentation from nose to tail. It is a loads calibrated airframe. Test instrumentation throughout the aircraft includes: 2,000+ loads bridges; 1,100+ accelerometers, pressure sensors, etc.; and 500+ intellibus interface modules. Aside from the configuration and non-commercial and commercial technical data associated with the aircraft excluding the instrumentation, the Government does not possess any technical data associated with the test instrumentation. The contemplated effort, in part, will require the resulting contractor to displace (move or remove) test instrumentation; after performing depot activities, replace (or re-install) test instrumentation; perform operational and functional checks of the instrumentation; and take action, as necessary, to get the instrumentation as a whole to perform correctly.</p>
<p>The 30 October 2015 Sources Sought Notice provided the opportunity for interested persons by 13 November 2015 to submit a Capability Statement identifying their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. The Government has completed its review of all written information submitted on or before 13 November 2015 in response to the Sources Sought Notice. The Government will not consider any information submitted by interested parties in response to this Presolicitation Notice. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing directly via Ms. Paige Bisset at (425) 965-8077 and paige.v.bisset@boeing.com.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida (NSWC PC), intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Stratus Systems, Incorporated (Inc.); 7550 Louisiana 23, Belle Chasse, LA 70037 for design, development, test and delivery of four (4) each kits to modify the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) Emergency Egress Lighting System (EELS) to electrically connect the existing proprietary and warrantied AAV EELS to AAV vehicle power.</p>
<p>This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Stratus Systems, Inc.; is the only company that can properly modify the proprietary system and maintain the warranty. The AAV EELS will be modified to accept and condition AAV vehicle power. The AAV EELS will utilize the AAV vehicle as the primary power source to reduce the Total Ownership Cost (TOC). The AAV EELS contains proprietary electronic assemblies for which Stratus Systems, Inc.; is the sole manufacturer. The AAV EELS is also subject to a 5 year warranty which is still in effect for fielded assets; AAV EELS is still in production. To properly address potential issues with the proprietary electronics, and to prevent voiding the warranty, it is imperative that the AAV EELS be modified by Stratus Systems, Inc. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery will be F.O.B. Destination to Naval Support Activity, Receiving Office, 100 Vernon Ave. Panama City, FL within 360 days after award of the order. NAICS 335129. Small Business size standard is 500 employees.

The SR panels step down 4160 to 120/208 VAC and distribute it through the CR sub-panels for lighting and other power uses including the fire detection system and security system. The contract entails the replacement of ten SR panels, installation of one CR sub-panel and removal and disposal of existing equipment being replaced.

Evaluation criteria will be stated in the RFP. The Government will include options in the RFP. This acquisition will result in a single firm-fixed-price contract.</p>
<p>Magnitude of Construction: The estimated cost of the project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Set Asides and Codes: This is an unrestricted, full and open acquisition. This effort is classified through the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under code 238210 - Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors ($15.0M). The FSC is Z2KA - Repair or Alteration of Dams.</p>

<p>NOTE: The Sources Sought Announcement for this requirement was previously advertised under number W68MD960336658.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: FY16 Libby Dam Emergency Lighting Summary of Work:<br />The Libby Dam Emergency Lighting project will provide upgrades to the emergency lighting and fire safety. Emergency lighting upgrades include additional lighting to emergency egress routes, placement of LED exit signs along egress routes, and conversion from use of the existing battery system to a self-contained UL 924 listed UPS. The existing emergency lighting system is 125 VDC to power incandescent lighting when switched to emergency mode. Normal power is 120 VAC. With incandescent lighting slowing being phased out, it was recommended to no longer rely on 125 VDC for the emergency lighting system.</p>
<p>Fire safety upgrades include updates to the egress path (including pressurization system for existing elevator, and new ladder installation), and replacement/decommissioning of existing fire alarm with new fire alarm. The existing notification and initiating circuits will be rerouted from the existing fire alarm control panel (FACP) to the new FACP. The new FACP shall maintain existing fire alarm notification and initiating circuits and add in the rest of the powerhouse into a centralized FACP. The FACP shall utilize class B circuits for both notification and initiating circuits. The fire alarm will utilize 8 Notification Amplifier Power Extender Panels (NAPEPs) to step up the voltage of the notification circuits due to the voltage drop concerns from the long distances the circuits travel in the powerhouse.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>

<DESC>This is a Market Survey to locate additional sources for fuel pumps, NSN: 2910-01-476-8668, P/N: RE505411, CAGE: 66836 U/O the 30 kW Tactical Quiet Generators (TQG) diesel engine model 4045TF151 which is U/O MEP-805B (50/60Hz), NSN: 6115-01-461-9335, and MEP-815B (400Hz), NSN: 6115-01-462-0290. The current source for the fuel pump is John Deere, CAGE 66836. Configuration drawings are not available. Detailed technical data for the manufacture of these units is not available from the Army. The pump is a high precision, high pressure injection pump specifically designed to inject the fuel into the 30 kW TQG engine. The pump must be manufactured by John Deere or the company that manufactures the pump for John Deere. Using a pump (I've never seen a second pump for a diesel engine in 30 years) from a different manufacturer would invalidate the EPA emission compliance of the engine. The engine would require emission recertification. PM-E2S2 would also require extensive qualification testing of any pumps from a different company because of the Military's use of JP-8 and other non-standard fuels.<br /><br />Suppliers or distributors capable of furnishing these assemblies must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: RDER-PRP-G, Building 6010, Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD 21005 or by email to: Brian.Kim3.civ@mail.mil and maria.s.mcalpine.civ@mail.mil. The response must include product lead time, price break ranges if applicable, other relative information that may impact acquisition, supply or delivery, vendor name, CAGE, address, company representative, Tel/fax#, and applicable email address. The successful supplier shall be required to warrant that the item supplied will satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Army. For more information contact Brian Kim, RDER-PRP-G, (443) 395-6261 and Maria Santiago McAlpine (443) 395-6966. The deadline for response is Wednesday 2 November 2016.<br />Respondents to this RFI must provide enough information to demonstrate their capabilities to perform any or all of these specific tasks; they should respond to_ ___________, by email.
<p>For more information, contact ________, or by email. <br />Responses should be received by _____________. EMAIL ADDRESS: _ ________________ Please complete the following questions. If a question does not apply, please enter N/A or non-applicable.</p>

<CONTACT>Ronald K. McCall, Contract Specialist, Email ronald.k.mccall.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (a) The<br />Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to assist in the development of a procurement strategy.
<p>The Government seeks potential sources having the experience and capabilities to provide an Atomic Layer Deposition System (ALD) with the ability to deposit high quality pico-thin films in alternating stacks to create optical films of &ge;50&mu; total thickness. The Government requests information on the potential source's knowledge, skill and experiences in producing such a system for research, development, and testing of thin film technologies for application in US Army missile systems. This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the US Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in development of procurement strategy for research, development, and testing of thin film technologies for application in US Army missile, sensor and protective systems. As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive information from potential offerors to assist in determination of the ability of potential offerors to provide a deposition system which shall provide the abilities to produce the optical thin films required for the research and development of sensors and sensor protection technologies to be incorporated into tactical systems and operations. No award is intended as a result of this sources sought notice nor does the Government intend to pay for information received. Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>For questions regarding this RFI, please contact the Government contracting POC, Mr. Ronald McCall, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, CCAM-RDB, Redstone Arsenal, AL, via email at ronald.k.mccall.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>The AMRDEC has requirements for an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) system to be used in the research, development, and testing of optically thin films and alternating pico-thin films for application in US Army missile sensor systems. Central to these requirements is a focus on controllable deposition, flawless defect free uniform pico-thin films, and defect free uniform pico-thin films into a cumulative stack of fifty (50) microns or more. Therefore, as part of this effort, all Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) systems should address the specific issues of the goal at hand, whether that goal is controllable layer deposition, flawless pico-thin films, or maximizing total stack height, without neglecting any of the other goals central to this requirement. Due to technology transition objectives, the Government seeks to identify companies that have capabilities to produce such a system for the government's efforts in the research, development, and testing of such films for eventual applications in military tactical sensors for missile, aviation and autonomous systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) system with capabilities of producing; (1) defect free uniform pico-thin films. Samples of promising films may be obtained for analysis for the AMRDEC's verification. (2) Defect free uniform pico-thin films of alternating materials. The process of switching between materials as they are deposited should not adversely affect the quality or uniformity of the individual layers. (3) The quality or uniformity of the alternating material stacked films shall be maintained up to a total thickness of at least fifty (50) microns.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the purpose of this RFI is to gather information about an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) system to be used in the research, development, and testing of optically thin films and alternating pico-thin films for application in US Army missile sensor systems.

<CONTACT>William Waterhouse, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-2243, Email william.waterhouse@navy.mil
<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!&nbsp; THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.&nbsp; The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Joint Base MDL, NJ&nbsp; is seeking potential sources for a Radar Beacon Test Set (RBTS).&nbsp; Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will be evaluated for applicability to Organizational / Intermediate-level ship and shore-based Naval Aviation maintenance.&nbsp; NAVAIR is conducting only market research in connection with this RFI.<br /><br />The RBTS would replace the AN/APM-455. The AN/APM-455 Radar Beacon Test Set, NIIN 01-327-0307 P/N 61205-40001, is a portable, hand-held, battery operated unit used to perform go/no-go testing of aircraft radar beacon systems and beacon transponder components of the All-Weather Carrier Landing Systems (ACLS). The AN/APM-455 supports testing of the APN-202 and APN-154 beacon transponders, R1623 receiver, and associated antennas. The APN-154 beacon transponder is no longer a requirement for the new test set. At the O-level, the test set is used with ancillary Antenna Coupler Interconnect Groups (ACIG) to interface with aircraft X-band and Ka-band antennas. These consist of the ACIG Common Assembly, P/N 61205-40210, and aircraft peculiar coupler sets. For I-level maintenance of the R-1623/APN, the AN/APM-455 is used as a high power Ka-band source with the C-6690B/APM-231 &amp; C-9154/APM Test Harness Controls and filter assembly peculiar support equipment along with General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE). Aircraft platforms supported by the new test set are the F/A-18 and EA-18G.</p>
<p>The following NAVAIR technical manuals provide more detailed information on the beacon transponder, receiver and the AN/APM-455 test set:</p>
<p>&bull; NAVAIR 16-30APM455-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL INTERMEDIATE AND DEPOT MAINTENANCE WITH ILLUSTRATED PARTS BREAKDOWN; Dated: 30 September 1991 w/change 1 - 14 August 1992<br />&bull; NAVAIR 16-30APN202-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS INTERMEDIATE AND DEPOT BEACON SET, RADAR AN/APN-202 PART NUMBER 01-P19175B001; Dated: 30 April1987 w/change 4 - 1 April 2009<br />&bull; NAVAIR 16-35R1623-1, R-1623/APN Radar Receiver, MD-817/APN BEACON MODULATOR, AS-2406/APR RADAR ANTENNA, INTERMEDIATE MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS Dated: 1 May 2010</p>

The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation may not necessarily result from the RFI.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: Request for Information from Accredited U.S. Business Schools to <br />Establish an MBA Program in Security Technology Management and Transition
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE RESPONDENTS:</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to their submissions; other than acknowledgment of receipt, provided a submitter requests such an acknowledgement.</p>
<p>By submitting a response, each respondent agrees that any and all costs the respondent incurs in responding to this request or in support of activities associated with this RFI shall be the sole responsibility of respondent. The Government shall incur no obligations or liabilities to anyone for any costs or expenses incurred by the respondent in responding to this RFI. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>This RFI is subject to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3. This RFI shall not be considered as an obligation by the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any Contractor's input submitted in response to the RFI. The Government recognizes that proprietary information and data may be part of this effort and, if so included, such data should be clearly marked.</p>
<p>Respondents will not be notified of the results. All responses to this sources-sought synopsis must also include a complete listing of contracts in which the submitting entity is performing training support services as described above, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is committed to using the most effective technologies and scientific talent to safeguard the country. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) has been charged with marshalling the U.S. science and engineering community to provide federal, state, and local officials with cutting-edge tools and information to protect the homeland. S&amp;T uses all available sources to acquire science and engineering talent and tools, including universities, federal laboratories, private-sector companies, nonprofit organizations and international partnerships. S&amp;T also implements national legislation and policy to promote technology transfer and facilitate commercialization of federally funded discoveries to academic institutions, industry, and local and state government partners. In 2011, the President signed a memorandum on Accelerating the Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Business, and requested all federal departments establish goals to accelerate the pace of technology transfer activities in partnership with non-federal entities in 2013-2017.</p>
<p>The S&amp;T Office of University Programs (OUP) engages the academic community to conduct research and analysis, and provide education and training to enhance DHS's capabilities. OUP brings together experts from all relevant academic disciplines to provide critical homeland security knowledge tools, technologies, training, and talent to solve complex security and resilience challenges. In support of S&amp;T's technology transition and commercialization efforts, OUP will sponsor a pilot MBA program to improve DHS's ability to get research and development (R&amp;D) products into the hands of the security professionals that need them.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE OF THIS RFI</p>
<p>OUP is soliciting information from potential academic sources regarding S&amp;T's plan to sponsor an MBA program with a focus on managing and transitioning security-related research, development and technology to the private and public sectors. This program will enhance the knowledge and skills of DHS program managers (PMs) by providing education and practical experience in research transition, technology transfer to end users in security agencies, and requirements for commercializing technology. This program will increase knowledge and strengthen the performance of PMs across the Department. DHS expects that ultimately this program will lead to more successful R&amp;D technology programs benefitting all of the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE ).</p>
<p><br />DESCRIBE/PROPOSE/IDENTIFY</p>
<p>OUP is seeking capability statements from educational institutions with accredited Masters of Business Administration (MBA) programs to develop a pilot for a MBA program with a focus on managing and transitioning security-related research, development and technology to the private and public sectors. Within the qualification statement please address the questions and comments below.</p>
<p>Development, Curriculum &amp; Platform <br />&bull; Describe the level of effort required to establish a pilot program as described above.

<DESC>NAICS: 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services / Size Standard $27.50
This is a Request For Information  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this Sources Sought announcement.  The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG) is soliciting information from qualified sources; the results of this announcement will be evaluated to determine if there are businesses capable of performing the proposed work.  
The USGS, OAG seeks responses from small business vendors that possess the capability to conduct technical, professional, statistical, and programming services for the USGS, Development of Assessment Techniques and Analysis Project (DATAP) funded by the USGS Mineral Resources Program.
Custom software to perform the simulation was developed by David Root in the 1980s to run on a Data General computer (Root and others, 1991). An Apple Macintosh version was released in 1998 (Root and others, 1998) and PC versions in 2000, 2004, and 2012 (Duval, 2000, 2004, and 2012). New and future releases of the Windows and Apple operating systems will ultimately make it impossible to run the existing code. The USGS scientists who wrote the code and ported the software to different computer platforms have retired from the USGS. Because of poor documentation, no one fully understands how the source code works or knows how to make modifications.
We need to reproduce the basic functionality of the simulation software programmed by Root using a coding platform that is well-documented, modular, and open-source  free to distribute and not tied to features in operating systems that will require constant updating. We also need to have access to the original computational approach so we can compare new results with those done in the past.
The contractor shall work with the project chiefs and project members by providing scientific, technical, and statistical assistance in evaluating our needs for undiscovered resource estimation, designing a computational approach that will allow us to continue using expert estimation of undiscovered deposits as an assessment technique, and creating and documenting code using the R statistical computing package to do Monte Carlo simulation in support of our assessments of undiscovered mineral resources. .
Technical Requirements of Contractor
The job requires (1) a thorough understanding of energy and mineral resource assessment methodologies of various types as used by the USGS, (2) an advanced knowledge (Ph.D. level or higher) of probability and statistics, as applied to geological resource issues, (3) a broad background in basic, applied, and pragmatic statistical approaches and methods, and (4) expertise in R programming.
Criteria for acceptance include a demonstrated knowledge as indicated by (1) a publication record indicative of both superior mastery of the concepts of probability and statistics as applied to earth science problems and (2) specific knowledge of and familiarity with USGS assessment methods and practices.




Work Requirements
Reproduce the simulation approach published by Root and others (1991) using the open-source R statistical computing package.
As originally described by Root and others (1991), the proposed code should:
	Use the algorithm developed by Root to convert expert estimates of undiscovered deposits (subjectively estimated at various quantiles) into a distribution that can be used in the simulation. 
	Allow for the user to specify the probability of zero deposits.
	Address the dependencies between ore tonnages and grades of deposits AND between grades of different metals in the same deposit type.
	Have both a lognormal and empirical option for modeling deposit ore tonnage and grade distributions.
	Use the same approach by Root to deal with missing grade data. The missing grades are assumed to be zero and the input dataset is divided into metal suites, representing each unique combination of metal associations, in order to calculate covariance in (see Root and others, p. 131 and 132).
	The output should retain metadata that summarizes the information used for the simulation (numbers of undiscovered deposits, the ore tonnage and grade models used, mode of operation, and so on).

For further information, interested parties may contact the Contracting Officer, Charlan Cabalsi at (916)278-9329 or ccabalsi@usgs.gov by the due date, 11/07/2016.

<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to identify business facilities/repositories interested in competing on a possible future Request-for-Proposal for curation services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) archaeological collections. All facilities/repositories interested, may respond to this Sources Sought at this time. The anticipated contract type will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Price Contract, with a 5 year ordering period.</p>
<p>This notice should not be construed as a commitment of any type by the Government to take or not take any action. Please note that USACE will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>General: The NAICS for this effort is 493190, Other Warehousing and Storage. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is $27.5 million annual average receipts (total or gross income).</p>
<p>Scope: The work covered by this Sources Sought includes housing, stabilizing, rehabilitating, preserving, transporting, and providing collections management services and access to archaeological materials and associated records (hereafter archaeological collections) generated in conjunction with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers activities throughout the continental United States (CONUS). 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 79-Curation of Federally-Owned and Administered Archeological Collections (Enclosure 1)-states in 79.6(b)(1), that, "When possible, the collection should be deposited in a repository that...(ii) Stores and maintains other collections from the same site or project location; or (iii) Houses collections from a similar geographic region or cultural area." Additionally, 36 CFR 79.6(b)(2) recommends that collections "should not be subdivided and stored at more than a single repository unless such subdivision is necessary to meet special storage, conservation, or research needs." Finally, the two components of these collections-material remains and associated records-"should be deposited in the same repository to maintain the integrity and research value of the collection." Except in those instances where non-federally owned material remains are retained and disposed of by the owner [36 CFR 79.6(b)(3)]. USACE will curate its archaeological collections across the CONUS. <br />Facilities/Repositories interested in housing USACE's collections should have the capacity to store between 2,000 to 5,000 cubic feet of USACE archaeological materials and up to 400 linear feet of records, and meet the standards set forth in 36 CFR 79.9.

<p style="text-align: center;">Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>1.0	SCOPE OF WORK: This Performance Work Statement (PWS) defines the procurement of the technical expertise and support services necessary to refine animal models of military relevant brain injury by better understanding the co-morbidities during the sub-acute and chronic timeframe after injury. This work supports the mission of the Brain Trauma, Neuroprotection and Neurorestoration (BTNN) Branch, Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).</p>
<p>2.0	BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) is to conduct biomedical research that is responsive to Department of Defense and U.S. Army requirements and delivers life saving products including knowledge, technology, and medical materiel that sustain the combat effectiveness of the war fighter. Brain Trauma Neuroprotection and Neurorestoration (BTNN) Branch, Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience, of the WRAIR conducts preclinical research of mild-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), specifically the penetrating ballistic-type TBI and closed head impact concussion for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). Research specializes in "polytrauma", accounting for the impact of hemorrhagic shock and failure to oxygenate and/or ventilate on the progression brain injury.</p>
<p>This research collaboration will evaluate a novel neurotherapeutic resuscitation strategy for treating TBI in the event of hemorrhagic shock during the pre-hospital phase. The findings will be the basis for future preclinical studies with delayed/long-term treatments and will provide important knowledge for future clinical studies. The research will provide insight leading to improvements in clinical practice guidelines to optimize resuscitation approaches for patients with TBI (i.e. approaches to optimize cerebral perfusion and brain salvage).  Successful translation of solutions generated from the research will improve stabilization and salvage of neurologic injuries at all echelons of care.</p>
<p>3.0	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: <br />Base Period:  1 January 2017- 31 December 2017 (or 1 year from date of contract award)<br />Option Year1: 1 January 2018- 31 December 2018<br />Option Year 2: 1 January 2019 - 31 December 2019</p>
<p>4.0	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this requirement is to facilitate the timely and efficient execution of the research by providing the provisions necessary to meet the objectives of this PWS and perform the tasks described in this PWS. The overall objective is to evaluate therapeutic strategies combining colloid resuscitation (Hextend) with drugs targeting cerebral edema via HMGB-1 blockade for pre-hospital treatment of TBI-polytrauma. To meet the objectives, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>&bull;	Shall provide support to monitoring research animals, conduct research experiments to meet the goals of the tasks, process research data files, analyze research data<br />&bull;	Shall provide technical expertise to conduct and analyze brain trauma neuroprotection and neurorestoration research.<br />&bull;	Shall have technical expertise to collect and analyze data.  <br />&bull;	To provide scientific and technical support for the development, validation, and application of animal models of TBI<br />&bull;	To provide scientific and technical support for the research, development, and efficacy evaluation of neuroprotection/neurorestoration therapies.<br />&bull;	To provide scientific and technical support for research on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain injury and neuroprotective/ neurorestorative therapies. <br />&bull;	To determine what pathological characteristics are measurable in the acute periods following CCI and polytrauma.<br />&bull;	To assess the neurobehavioral outcomes following prehospital treatment of fluid/drugs combination.</p>
<p>5.0	REQUIRED TASKS: The following tasks will support biomedical research to determine the efficacy of a novel prehospital resuscitation strategy targeting high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1)-induced cerebral edema for treating TBI and hemorrhagic shock. The experiments will be conducted using a mouse model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) with hemorrhagic shock (HS) to include:</p>
<p>5.0.1 Characterize the systemic/cerebral perfusion, oxygenation and intracranial pressure during shock, pre-hospital (treatment) and hospital (after treatment) phases of CCI and HS. Animals will be subjected to CCI+HS and then resuscitated with fluid and drugs at a specified dose (3 drugs with 3 different doses per drug) during the pre-hospital phase. Physiological parameters including mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, brain tissue oxygen tension and blood gases will be monitored continuously beginning at baseline (pre-injury), shock, pre-hospital to hospital phase. The volume of resuscitation fluid required to maintain the desired physiological parameters will be recorded. Cerebral edema formation for each rat brain will be examined using wet/dry method at 24 hours post-injury. A total of 100 animals (10 groups; 10 per group) will be used.</p>
<p>5.0.2 Examine the efficacy of the resuscitation fluid/drugs combination on ameliorating the blood-brain barrier integrity, inflammation and oxidative stress via blockade of HMGB-1 pathways. Animal will be subjected to CCI+HS and then resuscitated with fluid and drugs at a specified dose (3 drugs with optimal dose determined in Task 4.0.1). (1) At 2 and 24h after the hospital phase, brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum will be collected upon euthanization. Protein expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic HMGB-1, TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, p65 subunit of NF-&kappa;B, iNOS, 4HNE or 3NT in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, or blood serum will be evaluated using Western Blotting or ELISA. (2) At 4 h and 72 h after the hospital phase, Evans blue dye will be administered intravenously in another cohort of animals and allowed to circulate for 30&thinsp;min prior to perfusion. The amount of extracted dye from tissue homogenates will be quantified. (3) At 24 hour, transcardial perfusion will be performed in another cohort of animals for immunohistochemistry analyses to examine glial activation (GFAP and Iba-1 staining). Fluorescent immunostaining of HMGB-1 will be performed to confirm its nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation. A total of 120 animals (4 groups; 6 per group; 3 different cohorts of animals) will be used.</p>
<p>5.0.3 Assess the neurobehavioral outcomes following prehospital treatment of fluid/drugs combination. Animal will be subjected to CCI+HS and then resuscitated with fluid and drugs at a specified dose (3 drugs with optimal dose determined in Task 4.0.1). (1) Motor function will be assessed using Rotarod task at 7 days, 14 days, and 1 month post-injury. (2) Cognitive function will be assessed using Morris Water Maze task at 13-17 days, and 1 month post-injury. A total of 60 animals (4 groups; 15 per group) will be used.</p>

<DESC>Threat Systems Operations and Maintenance Integrated Support (TSOMIS)
<p>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source</p>
<p>Intent of the Notice: Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC - Orlando), through U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), in support of the Threat Systems Management Office (TSMO), intends to issue a contract modification to Test and Evaluation Services and Technology Limited Liability Corporation (TEST LLC), under contract W900KK-15-D-0002, on a sole source basis pursuant to only one responsible source who can meet the requirement until the full scope of the requirement can be solicited competitively. This contract modification will increase the contract ceiling by $17,780,000, from $44,451,927 to $62,231,927. The period of performance (ordering period) remains unchanged through 18 Nov 2019. Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, at this time it would create substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short-term extension of services. In addition, award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay of work in fulfilling the agency's requirements. An acquisition strategy is simultaneously being developed for these requirements with an anticipated date of acquisition strategy being developed on or about 01 May 2017.</p>
<p>Brief Description: Currently, TSMO designs, builds, operates, and maintains representations of operational and emerging hostile systems with virtually identical performance capabilities that match the identified threat. Integral to the success of the mission is the ability of TSMO to maintain consistent, efficient, and economic technology and manufacturing of Electronic Warfare (EW) simulators supplied for testing. TEST LLC is the only source with the extensive knowledge, skills, and expertise needed to continue TSOMIS operation and maintenance efforts and maintain the current schedule for test events.</p>
<p>The intellectual property and subject matter expertise that resides with the TEST LLC personnel are not transferable in a timely or cost-effective manner to facilitate a competitive acquisition to support immediate need requirements. The ramp up, transition period, and learning curve that a new contractor would need to fulfill the Army's requirements successfully would endanger the Government's ability to meet the current Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) for Programs of Record supported by TSOMIS. The delay would significantly affect the program schedule for on-going integration and testing to meet designated User test event schedules based on current Department of Defense weapon systems production plans and unit deployment schedules. The result of this delay would compromise national security and bring undo harm to the Soldier.</p>
<p>Responses: The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement and submit their response by close of business Nov 10, 2016. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the contract specialist Rebeca Gonzalez, rebeca.a.gonzalez.civ@mail.mil or call at 407-384-3968; or the Procuring Contracting Officer Jean Borowski at jean.m.borowski.civ@mail.mil or call at 407-380-4261.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products/services. No solicitation documents exist at this time.</p>

<DESC>The notice is issued to notify interested parties of a site visit for a project planned to be solicited sometime in the winter months when some or all of the project locations may be inaccessible.
<p><br />Description: Tree seedling planting on 253 acres that includes three items:</p>
<p>1. Full planting of conifer seedlings over 144 acres at 300 trees-per-acre. 4 units ranging 27- 55 acres. All units were burned in 2012, then site prepared in 2016 where all snags were removed, brush was pulled, piled, and will be burned prior to planting. Units will be relatively open and clear of vegetation. Variable terrain.</p>
<p>2. Full planting of conifer seedlings over 12 acres at 300 trees-per-acre. There are 6, 2-acre units that were clear-cut (group selections), site prepared, and are now relatively free of vegetation. Units will be relatively open and clear of vegetation. All units are on relatively flat terrain.</p>
<p>3. Interplanting on 97 acres over 3 units that were burned in 2012. Snags were felled and the units were planted in 2014. Currently, all 3 units are nearly completely covered with 2-5 foot whitethorn brush and will be difficult to move around and plant because a 5-foot radius will need to be cleared of brush and scraped at each planting spot.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</span></div>
<br /><strong>Description<br /><br /></strong>The National Assessment Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) in accordance with the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<br /><br />
<p>The membership of the Council of Chief State School Officers provides unique state perspectives on education matters, which is essential for informing the Governing Board's work. CCSSO membership includes Chief State School Officers and state education policymakers who have the knowledge and ability to provide state perspectives and outreach services representing all 50 states. This coordination among all 50 states and the federal government is essential for making informed policy decisions related to The Nation's Report Card and for carrying out the Board's congressionally-mandated responsibilities under the requirements of Public Law 107-279. More information on the work of the National Assessment Governing Board can be found at www.nagb.gov.</p>
<p>This notice is being posted under the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A formal solicitation will not be issued. The procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in or around December 2016. The contract period of performance will include a base year as well as 2 option years, for a maximum duration of 36 months.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB or Governing Board) has a congressional mandate to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)-also known as The Nation's Report Card- and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results. The Governing Board also has responsibility to plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. A key component in providing feedback on the Governing Board's work and disseminating NAEP is through expanded outreach activities with targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to NAEP, it is important to encourage and expand the involvement of state policymakers and educators in providing information and input to the Governing Board in executing its congressionally mandated responsibilities. As a continuing component of its policy making and outreach activities, the Governing Board seeks input from state stakeholders who are keenly interested in NAEP.</p>
<p><strong>Task Force History and Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Since September 2007, the Governing Board has been working collaboratively with the Task Force, composed of high-level state education agency staff.  The joint work involves discussions of current issues, policy decisions, and outreach mechanisms. The goal of this collaboration is to seek continuing state input and feedback to inform the Governing Board's policy setting work in specific areas.</p>
<p>Discussion topics addressed to date include NAEP reporting, inclusion and accommodations; NAEP assessment schedule; Grade 12 NAEP; NAEP reading trend line; NAEP contextual questions; Common Core State Standards; misuse and misinterpretation of NAEP data; international benchmarking; digital-based assessment; testing time; research with NAEP data; and several Board initiatives for NAEP. More information on the history and work of the Task Force can be found at https://www.nagb.org/what-we-do/outreach/ccsso.html.</p>
<p>The Task Force conducts its work through webinars and in-person meetings. A Task Force member attends each quarterly meeting of the Governing Board and provides routine reports on the Task Force's ongoing work. Project activities of the Task Force are available to the public via the Board's website and meeting transcripts of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings, which include an annual briefing for the Board delivered by the Task Force chair.</p>
<p>Topics to be discussed by the Task Force include release activities for 2017 NAEP reports, follow-up on previously discussed topics, as well as a variety of policy issues and activities from the Governing Board's new Strategic Vision.  In addition, one Task Force member shall attend each of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings as an observer or presenter to promote communication between the Governing Board and the Task Force.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Comment and Capability Statements</strong></p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. Please submit capability statements to anthony.r.white@ed.gov by November 29, 2016. Responses received will be posted via www.fbo.gov. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<p>These modifications will address the requirements of TSA's Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) in support of checked baggage screening operations.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source for each proposed contract action under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>Interest and capability to respond to the requirement from interested parties will be considered by the Government until 9:00am Eastern Time on November 25, 2016.

<p>7. The following provisions are incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial</p>
<p>8. The following provisions are incorporated by full-text.</p>
<p>52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, Addendum, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(1) FAR 52.212-1, paragraph (b)(8), is changed to read: <br />(8) Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.</p>
<p>(2) FAR 52.212-1, paragraph (c), is changed to read:<br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold prices in its offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(3) To be considered for this requirement, the offer must complete the Bid Schedule (see paragraph 4). Fully complete the pricing on each CLIN as required. The contractor shall fill out a unit price, the extended price and a total price for all CLINs. Please ensure that all prices, extended prices and total prices are checked and verified for accuracy. DO NOT go two (2) digits beyond the decimal point.</p>
<p>(4) In accordance with FAR Part 9, Contractor Qualifications, past performance information provided will be used to determine whether an offeror has a satisfactory performance record to determine whether the offeror is a responsible contractor eligible for contract award.<br />An offeror determined to have an unsatisfactory performance record will be determined non-responsible, therefore, the offeror will not be eligible for contract award.<br />In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>The Government has a right to retrieve additional past performance information through the Government's past performance databases, Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).<br />(5) Questions and Answers. All questions must be submitted in writing. The deadline for submitting questions and providing answers is Friday, 28 October 2016, 12:00 p.m. (noon) PST.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>Award will be made to the Offeror whose Acceptable Technical Proposal represents the Best Value to the Government. Best Value will be determined by the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable proposal. Offers will be rated by technical acceptability and award will be made to the lowest priced offer.</p>
<p>(1) The evaluation team will evaluate each offer on its merits and assign one of the following ratings to each offer.<br /><br />Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable Offer clearly meets the requirements of the Solicitation and the Requirements Description.<br />Unacceptable Offer does not clearly meet the requirements of the Solicitation and the Requirements Description.</p>
<p>Price. The Government shall conduct a price evaluation of all offers. The Government will evaluate an offer by adding the total price for all CLINs. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair, reasonable and realistic price. Evaluation of prices will determine if they are compatible with the scope of the effort, are not unbalanced and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished. It is expected that the competitive nature of this acquisition will drive price reasonableness and fairness; however, the Government reserves the right, if it deems appropriate, to make these determinations by means of one or more price analysis techniques.</p>
<p>a. Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR Part 9.1, whose offer conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this RFQ) and is judged, based on the evaluation to represent the best value offer.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award 1 (one) contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>b. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [ ___ ] Are, [ ___ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ___ ] Have, [ ___ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [ ___ ] Are, [ ___ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ___ ] Have, [ ___ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.</p>

If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Gauze, Petrolatum will be established approximately February 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Gauze, Petrolatum. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Gauze, Petrolatum.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Gauze, Petrolatum. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $261,069. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Twelve items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 99.34% ($259,335) of the total volume in sales ($261,069). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to IHS through this contract.<br /><br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br /><br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br /><br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br /><br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br /><br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>&nbsp;MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

The Government is not required to provide responses to vendor's inquiries or correspondence.</p>
<p>2)	Quote Preparation<br />The following instructions apply for the submission of quotes:</p>
<p>a.	Quotes shall be submitted in three separate volumes:<br /> <br /> Volume I - Technical <br /> Volume II - Past Performance<br /> Volume III - Price</p>
<p>b.	The technical volume shall not contain any reference to price.  It is incumbent upon the vendor to provide a technical volume in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that includes, but is not limited to, the technical requirements of the Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>c.	The Government will evaluate quotes in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in FAR 52.212-2 of this RFQ.</p>
<p>3)	Quote Instructions</p>
<p>a.	Technical: Each vendor shall submit a technical submission that contains the following information:</p>
<p>i.	Capability Statement (10 Page Limit) - Vendor shall describe its ability to adhere to the required delivery requirements as well as its capability to meet all the specifications of this requirement. To this end, the Technical Capability statement should be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete so as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the offeror has a thorough understanding of the requirements;<br />ii.	FAA Repair Station Certification - Vendor must provide a copy of its and, if applicable, its subcontractor's FAA Repair station Certificate coving Twin Otter DHC-6-300 aircraft. Vendor shall include the number and type of FAA Repair Station Certificates covering airframe, power plant, avionics, and instruments;<br />iii.	Proof of Insurance of $2,500,000.00 at a minimum;</p>
<p>b.	Past Performance:<br />Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the vendor to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation. Vendors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm's most recently completed contracts/orders (not to exceed five (5) years since completion) for like or similar work. Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Each Vendor shall submit, in writing, information on past performance (Attachment 02). Vendors shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation. The Vendor is required to send Attachment 02, Past Performance Questionnaire, to those government and commercial activities provided by the vendor's in their submission.  The information shall be completed by the references who will then forward the completed questionnaires:</p>
<p>James Rall<br /> james.rall@noaa.gov (Cc andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov) <br /> U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/ERAD</p>
<p>The Government will not accept Questionnaires directly from the vendors, only Questionnaires submitted on time and from vendor's references will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation based upon the past performance of the vendor as it relates to the probability of vendor to provide the Government with quality service as covered within the solicitation.</p>
<p>Vendors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government. The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry. This information may include Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity System (FAPIIS), or past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The burden of providing thorough, complete, and relevant past performance information rests with the vendor.  Any Past Performance Questionnaire(s) received at the Government office designated herein after the exact time specified for receipt of past performance information is "late" and may not be considered for evaluation.  If the vendor possess no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state so in the quote.</p>
<p>Vendors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. However, the submission with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful submission when compared to the submissions of other Vendors having an satisfactory (or better) past performance.</p>
<p>c.	Price: The vendor shall submit all information required in the line items included within this solicitation.  In addition, the vendor will submit a price list for B.1 of Attachment 01: Specifications (Partial List of Projected Components to be ordered for DHC-6-300 Twin Otter [Exchange, Overhauled, and New]).  Line items pricing and pricing for Partial List of Projected Components will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Oct 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&bull;	Technical <br />&bull;	Past Performance<br />&bull;	Price</p>
<p>Technical Approach and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not award at significantly higher prices to only achieve slightly better performance. The Government will assess the benefits or better performance versus the added price through trade-off analysis. As non-price factors become equal-price becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>AIM is a set of software tools designed to improve, streamline, and automate certain aspects of the development and maintenance of Navy training materials. The Navy uses three different approaches for the development of training materials: Personnel Performance Profile (PPP), Task-Based, and Competency/Skills-Based. AIM I supports the PPP approach to training material development, AIM II supports the Task-Based approach, and AIM Content Planning Module (CPM)/Learning Object (LO) Module supports a Competency Skills-Based or Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) approach. These tools allow for more efficiency and responsiveness in the production and life cycle maintenance of training materials to Navy training activities and to other organizations external to the Navy.
 AIM also optimizes the process of instructional development and standardizes the training materials by automating the format and standards promulgated in various military and commercial training design/ development standards. AIM I, II, and CPM/LO Module all operate in the Microsoft MS Windows environment to provide a graphical user interface. 

AIM access is currently provided from a centralized government hosted environment where users can access the AIM software and database from geographically dispersed locations. This AIM Central Site effort provides AIM software access and related data to an increasingly wider Navy audience while facilitating data integrity and concurrency. For those users who are not able to access the centralized environment, standalone instances of the AIM software are still in use.
 CPM is web-based and current plans for the AIM project includes the eventual suspension of the AIM I  and II applications, and the merging of the LO Module with CPM for a fully web-based AIM application.

The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). 

One of the major duties of Green Management Program Service (GMPS) is to report VA fleet inventory, operational costs, and fuel consumption to GSA, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and DOE. This is accomplished each October through December.  
Federal agencies, including VA, must annually submit to the General Services Administration (GSA) the information needed to produce the Federal Fleet Report (FFR).  GSA s internet-based data collection and reporting system is known as the Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST).  The FAST system is also used by agency fleet managers to provide information to DOE as required by the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and various Presidential executive orders. In addition, OMB requires agency fleet managers and budget officers to submit agency motor vehicle budgeting information to OMB through FAST.  The bulk of the report is based on the required fleet management data information provided from various offices across VA. Complete and accurate fleet management data is essential for VA to submit a high quality report. This also allows VA to compare trends at a facility, regional, and national level for use in various internal analyses.  
The objective of this project is to assist VA with fleet management data analysis and compiling other related data so that VA can deliver an accurate, timely report to GSA and DOE. This includes quality control and quality assurance of fleet management data.   
Fleet management data for all administrations and staff offices is collected via GSA Fleet Drive Thru and GSA FedFMS.  These databases are available via the internet on GSA s website, and are assessable with log-in protocols.  Contractor can perform duties on or offsite from the VA.
VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firm must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by October 31, 2016 and a response to the questions will be posted by October 31, 2016 as an amendment to the solicitation.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority. See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999). (b) Agency protests filed with the Contracting Officer shall be sent to the following address: [Insert Contracting Officer name and Address] (c) Agency protests filed with the agency Protest Decision Authority shall be sent to the following address: [Insert appropriate Protest Decision Authority name and Address] (d) A complete copy of all agency protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel within one day of filing a protest with either the Contracting Officer or the Protest Decision Authority. (e) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) A protest may be filed with either the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims unless an agency protest has been filed. (b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

(b)  The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. 
	(c) Representation.  By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer.

No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose.

<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting<br />`more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>

<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Quote and the solicitation number is VA101-17-Q-0244. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a portfolio of over 1,900 operational leases, approximately 1,500 of which are direct (i.e., via GSA Delegation) leases.  Each year, VA replaces, renews, or enters into hundreds of leases, in addition to the exercising of options, entering into standstill agreements, and other similar lease actions.  Changes to GSA Delegation policy provides that VA must secure delegation on a project by project basis and make use of GSA s GREX delegation system to do so.  This process involves the preparation of lease packages for internal VA approval, upload of various documents to GSA s GREX system (including scoring), and ultimately execution of the lease contract once delegation is received.  This process must be completed in compliance with internal VA policy requirements, GSA delegation requirements, and OMB A-11 Appendix B requirements.
The contractor shall be responsible for the following: maintaining and updating (SharePoint based tracker already exists) a tracking and reporting system on leases currently in process of receiving internal approval, delegation from GSA, or execution of lease contract; review of submitted lease packages to ensure compliance with internal approval, GSA, and OMB A-11 requirements including documentation and communication of any identified deficiencies; detailed review of each lease scoring to ensure proper scoring is done and a lease qualifies as an operating lease under OMB A-11; specific documentation and training material related to the lease delegation process, best practices, and scoring of leases and application of OMB A-11 Appendix B; enhancements to the existing SharePoint based tracking tool to include improved data validation, reporting, quality control, and security; update of VA s lease scoring model (Excel  template already exists) and associated training material; general program support including meeting minutes.
OAEM, VA s Real Property Service (RPS), VHA, and other organizations will be responsible for package creation and interaction directly with GSA s GREX system.  Information on project status will come from the same sources; however, the contractor is responsible for the tracking and update of information provided by these various offices and ensuring the quality of the data in the lease tracking system.  The tasks are to support VA in implementing the new requirements as a result of the GSA Delegation policy change.  Tasks will not replace inherently governmental reviews of individual lease projects.
VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firm must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by October 22, 2016 and a response to the questions will be posted by October 25, 2016 as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 541611. This solicitation closes on October 31, 2016 at 6:30:00 am (EST). Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified in VIP data base as SDVOSB

The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB). 

One of the major duties of Green Management Program Service (GMPS) is to report VA fleet inventory, operational costs, and fuel consumption to GSA, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and DOE. This is accomplished each October through December.  
Federal agencies, including VA, must annually submit to the General Services Administration (GSA) the information needed to produce the Federal Fleet Report (FFR).  GSA s internet-based data collection and reporting system is known as the Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST).  The FAST system is also used by agency fleet managers to provide information to DOE as required by the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and various Presidential executive orders. In addition, OMB requires agency fleet managers and budget officers to submit agency motor vehicle budgeting information to OMB through FAST.  The bulk of the report is based on the required fleet management data information provided from various offices across VA. Complete and accurate fleet management data is essential for VA to submit a high quality report. This also allows VA to compare trends at a facility, regional, and national level for use in various internal analyses.  
The objective of this project is to assist VA with fleet management data analysis and compiling other related data so that VA can deliver an accurate, timely report to GSA and DOE. This includes quality control and quality assurance of fleet management data.   
Fleet management data for all administrations and staff offices is collected via GSA Fleet Drive Thru and GSA FedFMS.  These databases are available via the internet on GSA s website, and are assessable with log-in protocols.  Contractor can perform duties on or offsite from the VA.
VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firm must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by October 31, 2016 and a response to the questions will be posted by October 31, 2016 as an amendment to the solicitation.

The BFI will provide a comprehensive summary of the Laser Division's upcoming acquisition - Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments (LANCE) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) which will support the Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) program. This briefing will provide industry with an understanding of RD strategies, future directions, and business opportunities with AFRL/RDL.
<p><br />The objective of the BFI is to provide a timely update to the Government-contractor community on the mission and vision of the LANCE project and how it relates to the overall SHiELD ATD. It provides a forum for industry to gain knowledge and insight into the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) RDL is pursuing by providing a thorough and comprehensive presentation of LANCE's technical objectives. In addition, the BFI will offer ample opportunities to communicate directly with the presenters through one-on-one sessions which will be held after the briefing. This is an excellent opportunity for the Government and Industry partners to meet, enhance awareness of program challenges, explore opportunities, stimulate competition, and facilitate collaboration for the upcoming acquisitions in support of the SHiELD ATD.</p>

The contract entails the replacement of ten SR panels, installation of one CR sub-panel and removal and disposal of existing equipment being replaced. Replacement and installation includes cabinets, conduit, wiring, disconnects, transformers and breakers.</p>

<p>Magnitude of Construction: The estimated cost of the project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Set Asides and Codes: This is an unrestricted, full and open acquisition. This effort is classified through the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under code 238210 - Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors ($15.0M).
