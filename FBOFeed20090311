<DESC><p>The Global Systems Positioning (GPS) Wing will release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) on 19 January 2009. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category 1D program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1 and 2. Block 1 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1 capabilities, Block 2 will integrate GPS IIIA capabilities into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, TT&amp;C, on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 37 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Potential Offerors who believe they are technically capable but were not awarded a Phase A contract shall submit a statement of capability within 10 days of the posting of this announcement. Potential Offerors shall indicate whether they are a large or small business and their interest as a prime or subcontractor.</p>
<p>No further notices for this solicitation will be posted. The GPSW will communicate directly with responsible prime contractors deemed capable to provide responsive proposals.</p>

<SUBJECT>Interrogative Anti-Submarine Warfare (IASW)
<SOLNBR>DARPA-BAA-09-24
<RESPDATE>031010
<CONTACT>DARPA-BAA-09-24 DARPA-BAA-09-24, BAA Coordinator, Email BAA09-24@darpa.mil - 
<DESC>The Interrogative Anti-Submarine Warfare (IASW) program seeks to develop innovative solutions to dramatically close detect-to-engage timelines for Navy tactical ASW search systems. Typically these are active sonar systems that have the ability to detect and localize submarines over large areas with the ability to prosecute the targets as needed. End solutions identified by the IASW program may also apply for surveillance systems and future undefined long-range detection systems. 

Currently, the intermediate step between detect and engage is consumed by a manned platform that flies to the possible contact position to re-acquire the underwater submarine target. For ship systems, a helicopter is tasked to validate and engage the target. For maritime patrol aircraft, the aircraft must break from its search (and drop altitude) to validate and engage the target. As such, there is little tolerance for false alerts which must be investigated sequentially. Further, the ability to handle multiple targets is limited. A successful IASW program will identify technology and system concepts that permit rapid and near simultaneous interrogation of long-range alerts without the mission costs of a manned aircraft. This will reduce the burden on operators and systems to correctly classify the target at long-range, and will provide engagement-quality localization for potential future standoff weapons. Solutions must at least address ship-based ASW, but will be more attractive if they are extendable to maritime patrol aircraft and surveillance systems.  

Proposers should consider solutions that permit rapid delivery of multiple proximity sensors capable of detecting, classifying, and communicating the presence or absence of a target.  The main technology components to consider should provide the following: 1. Delivery that is fast and which permits near-simultaneous interrogation of cued target positions; 2. Sensing that provides highly reliable detection and classification and; 3. Communication that provides robust message extraction from multiple long-range positions. With rapid delivery, it is expected that small time-late target position uncertainties will permit near-target sensor emplacement. This should lead to a rich set of signatures for classification automation. Successful automation should broaden the range of data extraction approaches. Communication is expected to be particularly challenging.

Proposers must have existing, and in-place prior to execution of an award, approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose but at a minimum SECRET.

DARPA-BAA-09-24, entitled Interrogative Anti-Submarine Warfare (IASW) is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the area of interest, the submission process, proposal formats, as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information. The BAA is attached as a Word Document File, IASW BAA 2009Mar11 Finalx.

Administrative, technical, or contractual questions should be sent via email to BAA09-24@darpa.mil. All requests must include the name, address, and phone number of a point of contact.

<a href="mailto:maria.papet@navy.mil">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The US Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support.  These collaborations increase the fundamental understanding of HIV and provide a basis for prevention, care, and treatment activities.  The current HIV/AIDS epidemic is devastating.  Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population.  In order to target this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General and Naval Medical Support Command (NMSC), has been tasked to serve as the US Department of Defense (DoD) technical oversight for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP).
DHAPP has successfully engaged over 70 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services.  DHAPP is a partner U. S. Government (USG) organization collaborating with the US State Department, Health and Human Services, US Agency for International Development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  DoD representatives participate in PEPFAR country teams, core teams and technical working groups to help formulate the Country Operational Plans (COP) in the fight against HIV.  Working closely with the US Department of Defense, the US Unified Combatant Commanders, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and in developing sustainable capacity to combat HIV.  
The new Partnership Framework within PEPFAR is a 5-year HIV/AIDS national strategy which will work in concert with and support the host country's national HIV/AIDS strategy.  The Partnership Framework will delineate USG's and host country's roles and contributions to achieving stated goals and objectives.
The Phase I Partnership Framework countries are Ghana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Dominican Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Namibia, and Ukraine. In addition, there is 1 regional Partnership Framework. The Caribbean Regional Partnership Framework includes the following countries: Barbados, Bahamas, Belize, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines. For most of the Partnership Frameworks, the Ministry of Defense and US DoD will have a vital role in designing and implementing the strategy.
It is anticipated that most of the Partnership Frameworks will be finalized by September 2009. It is important for offerors receiving an award who work in one of the aforementioned Partnership Framework countries to connect with the military Partnership Framework point of contact.  Offerors receiving an award should be aware of the military's PEPFAR activities and work in concert with these activities without duplicating efforts, creating parallel systems, or conflicting activities.  
DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on the drivers of the epidemic specific to the military, and to support the development of interventions and programs to improve HIV prevention, care, and treatment.  DHAPP works with country militaries to devise plans based on the following process:
.	Meet with key partners in country to determine appropriate program focus and other technical assistance requirements. .	Adapt DHAPP support for prevention, care and/or treatment of the military's personnel and families based on an assessment of the country's epidemic and on its military's response. .	Strengthen the military capacity for developing and executing sustainable HIV programs. .	Improve program design by leveraging assets from other donors and with other country partners who have managed successful prevention, care, and/or treatment efforts. .	Focus on prevention, care and/or treatment impact aligned with national implementation plans. .	Implement, monitor and evaluate programs to ensure efficacy, accountability and sustainability. 
Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate: 
.	Visible support from the military sector. .	Development of plans of action and policies. .	Alignment with PEPFAR, as well as national, strategies and priorities..	Increasing HIV awareness and action against HIV within the military sector. .	Country military ownership of HIV activities. .	Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and management, behavioral interventions, reduction of multiple concurrent partnerships, prevention and care of opportunistic infections, male circumcision, changing male normative behaviors, and prevention campaigns focused on high risk personnel and high prevalence areas..	Reduction of mother-to-child transmission..	Stigma reduction associated with HIV infection. .	Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, prevalence surveys, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training, and strategic information management..	Increasing and leveraging financial and other resources. 
The DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP), based at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, California, provides technical assistance, management, and administrative support of the global HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment for foreign militaries. DHAPP administers funding, conducts training, and provides technical assistance to participating militaries.  In addition, DHAPP staff serve on most of the PEPFAR Technical Working Groups and Core Teams through the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. DHAPP provides HIV program execution and monitors outcomes.  
More information about countries in which DHAPP currently operates and existing DHAPP programs can be found on the DHAPP website:http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nhrc/dhapp/background/Pages/default.aspx

<DESC>SUBJECT: R - Regional Oversight Contract (ROC) for Federal facilities, FUDS, or FUSRAP sites in EPA Region III, which includes the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
DESC: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires Federal Facility oversight services to support the Agency in its mission of oversight and enforcement both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at sites located at active, closing, closed, or former Federal facilities, including a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) or Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site, and, to a lesser extent, non-Federal facilities within the geographic boundaries of EPA Region III.
The Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 waives sovereign immunity for Federal hazardous waste generators, CERCLA 120 and the extensive oversight responsibilities to EPA for hazardous waste remediation projects at Federal facilities.  To fulfill these responsibilities, EPA reviews technical documents generated by the facility (or its contractor), approves remedies, oversees removals, assists in deliberations leading to agreements with other Federal agencies or non-Federal potentially responsible parties (PRPs), and determines appropriate penalties where necessary.  
The successful offeror will be required to demonstrate competency in the following areas: technical document review; meeting support; field activities and data review; and technical support for such activities as CERCLA Site assessments, Remedial Investigations/Feasibility Studies, Removals, Remedial Designs, post-Record of Decision (ROD) actions, community involvement and outreach, data management services, military munitions response services, radiation, and negotiations.
For the purposes of this procurement, the Agency will determine if  an offeror has a  pre-award potential conflict of interest (COI) if it currently holds a prime contract or subcontract with any party (other than EPA) for work related toCERCLA or RCRA activities, remedial planning or implementation, or reuse planning or development at sites located at an active, closing, closed, or former Federal facility within EPA Region III.  Any such potential conflict will be evaluated by EPA prior to award.
This procurement is a small business set-aside using NAICs code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (Firms with 500 employees or less) and will result in the competitive award of one (1) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) - type contract with a minimum guarantee of $50,000 and a maximum of $1.5 million.  The contract will be Fixed Hourly Rates with indirect rate ceilings and charges for direct labor, travel, and other direct costs (ODCs).  The period of performance will consist of a one year base period and four option years.  The work will be handled via task orders. 
The resulting contract will be awarded based on technically acceptable / lowest price.
The selected firm will be required to submit a cost proposal, contract management plan, internal COI procedures, COI screen of Region III Federal Facility sites, quality assurance plan, procedures for handling confidential business information, health and safety plan, and plan for delivering analytical services.  In order to be awarded a contract, these must be deemed acceptable by EPA and agreement must be reached on a reasonable price.  Prior to award, contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation of costs.
The solicitation is scheduled for release on or about February 11, 2009.  The POC for this solicitation is James M. Clark, (P) 215-814-5198.  Requests for additional information should be emailed to clark.jim@epa.gov

<SUBJECT>INFRA-RED DETECTION OF MARINE MAMMALS FROM SHIP-BASED PLATFORMS
<SOLNBR>ONRBAA09-015
<RESPDATE>032309
<CONTACT>Angela Bruce-Dunson, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 703 696 2577, Fax 703 696 0066, Email angela.bruce-dunson@navy.mil - James E. Eckman, Program Officer, Phone 703-696-4590, Email eckmanj@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for research into the use of infra-red (IR) band technology as a potential means of detecting marine mammals.  There are significant concerns about the effects of anthropogenic sound (e.g., use of military sonar, seismic research and exploration, marine construction, shipping) on marine mammals.  As a means of minimizing interactions between anthropogenic acoustic activities and marine mammals, human observers are often employed to detect marine mammals and initiate mitigation strategies when mammals are observed sufficiently close to active sound sources. Visual observations, the current standard, are limited in their effective use to daytime, comparatively clear atmospheric conditions and relatively low sea states. Additionally, alternative detection methods currently being used to detect marine mammals include 1) passive acoustics, which is dependent on vocalizing animals; and 2) active acoustics, which has been reserved for research, releases energy into the water and must be assessed for possible adverse effects.  Because all these methods have their shortcomings, additional alternative and/or complementary marine mammal detection methods are being developed, including use of radar and IR.  

Our goal is to evaluate the efficacy of IR imagery (still and/or video) for near-real-time detection of marine mammals from ship-based platforms.  Ultimately IR detection might be optimized by use of high-incident angle views of the sea surface via unmanned aerial vehicles (or other platforms).  However, to minimize initial investment costs while we evaluate the potential of this detection technology we will not here invest in studies using a costly autonomous flying platform.  Rather we seek to invest in research using ship-based, more oblique-angle techniques coupled with visual observation of marine mammals, which offers validation opportunities.  At the discretion of the proposer, ship-based measurements might utilize tethered balloons, kites or tall masts to increase incident viewing angles of the imagery system, and might be preceded by land (cliff)-based evaluations that could cost effectively develop and test the proposed technology.

Our interest is in developing and testing a small, light weight, low power IR imagery (still and/or video) system that may be adaptable to diverse platforms.  Therefore the focus of this BAA is on uncooled (microbolometric) IR systems, and not cooled systems.

Proposers should describe and defend the proposed sensor(s) and imagery system(s), the nature and stability of the deployment system as it relates to expected image quality, the sampling protocol for marine mammal detection, the time responsiveness and need for human control of the proposed system(s), and goals for detection in terms of range and spatial resolution.  Proposers must also describe plans for field tests using the proposed IR system(s) as well as validation efforts in conjunction with visual observers.  Proposals should request all costs required for completion of the proposed work, including ship costs and use of visual observers.

Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university or by industry.  ATD is funded through Budget Activity 3.  In conformance with the USD(AT&L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity.  As regards to the present BAA, the Research and Development efforts to be funded will consist of applied research.  The funds available to support awards are Budget Activity 2.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from electric generation suppliers to provide electric power supply to Federal and non-Federal accounts in the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland. The successful offeror will supply all electricity components for a contract term of twenty-four (24) full billing months. Deliveries will begin with the December 2009 meter read date for all accounts behind PEPCO unless otherwise specified. A six (6) month extension period is included in the contract. The approximate annual electric requirement is 1.815 billion kWhs per year for accounts in the District of Columbia and 550 million kWhs per year for accounts behind PEPCO in Maryland. The Government has divided its requirements into two (2) pricing groups: one for PEPCO DC and one for PEPCO MD.  All pricing groups will require a minimum of 5% renewable power escalating to 7.5% if the contract term extends beyond September 30, 2012 as defined in the solicitation.  The Government is requesting pricing for the 24-month term for each of the two (2) pricing groups.  Capacity and transmission prices will be treated as pass-through items in accordance with the terms of the contract.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST 

Requirement:  

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Cedar Rapids, IA that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 20,145 of contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 19,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by May 1, 2009. .  The delineated area in Cedar Rapids is North: Boyson Road from Miller Road to Interstate 380; East: Interstate 380 from Boyson Road to 33rd Ave. SW; South: within 2 blocks north or south of 33rd Ave. SW from Interstate 380 to Edgewood Road; West: Edgewood Road from Boyson Road to 33rd Ave. SW. 

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

	Easy access to Interstate highways;
	Single occupancy locations are preferred;
	30 secured surface parking spaces for official Government vehicles; 
	Mixed use locations containing office and warehouse/storage areas with dock access needed.

The project will comply with the Interagency Security Committee-Security Standards for Leased Space which would require a 100-Foot set back for new construction, and a 
20-foot set back for existing locations. This Government office shall not be located adjacent to, in close proximity and/or within residential areas, educational facilities, religious facilities, and/or retail facilities.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institute (NCI).</p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.  THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HuBZone) Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business (SDVOSB) that are interested in and capable of  performing the work described herein.  The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>The Development and Technical Services for the Applied Research Program (ARP), Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch (RFMMB), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences,   National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking capability statements from all eligible Small Businesses as state above, under NAICS Code #541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical  Services) with a size standard $7,000,000 per annum. Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT Notice, the government may issue an intent to award a Justification For Other Than Full And Open Competition.</p>
<p>The NCI, ARP/RFMMB seeks to continue to conduct further evaluations and validations of the current web-based automated self-administered 24-hour recall (ASA24).  The proposed project expands the current contract with Westat Inc, Contract N02-PC-64406 to add a large study of 1000 participants and a small feeding study of 30 participants for purposes of collecting data to compare a new software, a web-based automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall, to a high quality interviewer-administered 24-hour recall using the US Department of Agriculture's, Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM).  <strong>This is an expansion of studies and work already underway to cognitively test and design the ASA24 software.</strong> To perform the requirements, the contractor must have current knowledge of the web-services, voice software, graphic user interface and complex database operations of the new ASA24 software to be able to efficiently conduct tasks for this study, and diagnose and address software problems as they arise in an accurate and timely manner.</p>
<p>All eligible small business sources responding to this Sources Sought Notice must have the capabilities to provide assistance to the Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch and the Applied Research Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to evaluate the validity and reliability of a newly developed web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24).</p>
<p>This is an expansion of studies and work already underway to cognitively test and design the ASA24 software.  Two studies will be conducted in separate study populations; <strong>Study 1: a large-scale comparison study and Study 2: a small observational validation study.</strong> A description of the major tasks is as follows:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of  Study 1 - The Contractor shall</span>:</p>
<p>&bull;	Administer two types of 24 hour dietary recalls (ASA24 and an AMPM 24 hour recall) in a free living adult population (20-70). The study group should be diverse in terms of gender major race/ethnicity (white, African-American, Hispanic), years of education (&lt;12, 12, &gt;12), and geographical residence (urban vs. rural; region).  The population samples will be drawn from no more than four large health maintenance organizations in different regions of the country with differing rural/urban and race/ethnicity profiles.</p>
<p>&bull;	Using a screener questionnaire, select a study group to complete participation by 1000 individuals.  The study group will be composed of 500 men and 500 women, and composed of 5 age decades (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-70) with approximately 100 subjects per decade.  The study group will be randomized into 4 groups of 250.  All participants will complete two non-consecutive dietary recalls, ordered per randomized group.  Group 1 will complete two online ASA24 recalls; Group 2 will complete two interviewer-administered telephone AMPM recalls; Group 3 will complete one online ASA24 recall followed by an interviewer-administered telephone AMPM recall; Group 4 will complete an interviewer-administered telephone AMPM recall followed by an online ASA24 recall.  The amount of time to allow between administrations is 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Study 2 - The Contractor shall:</span></p>
<p>&bull;	Administer two 24-hour recall instruments (ASA24 and AMPM 24-hour recall) in a free-living adult population (20-70 years).  The study group should employ sampling techniques to include respondents of diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>&bull;	Using a screener questionnaire, a study group will be selected which will result in complete participation by 60 individuals.  The study group will be composed of 30 men and 30 women, in 5 age decades (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-70) with approximately 6 subjects per decade for each gender.  The study participants will be randomized into 2 groups of 30, Group A and Group B.  Each subject in Group A will be matched to a subject in Group B based on age group, gender, and education.</p>
<p>&bull;	 Participants will complete an observational ad lib feeding study.  The testing schedule will consist of food consumption on Day 1 followed by food reporting on Day 2.  Participants will visit a location and be fed two meals.  For each meal, participants will be able to choose from several foods and beverages, buffet-style, with no limit on the amount of food each participant may take.  A different set of foods and beverages will be offered for the second meal.  All participants will have the same options for both meals.</p>
<p>&bull;	All foods taken by the participant will be weighed unobtrusively prior to and after the meal.  The method by which this will occur is via weighing of the common pot or item before and after the food is self-served, and then weighing the amount left on the plate when the participant is finished.  In this way, weights of all foods consumed by each participant will be obtained.  Each food will be coded using the FNDDS; gram weights will be translated into common measures (cups, ounces, sizes, etc.) as applicable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DURATION</span>:  It is anticipated that the additional studies will be completed in 18 months.  Within the first year, packages for approvals from OMB and IRB will be requested and  all the planning and preparation for the study and the start of the data collection for Study 2.</p>
<p>Capability Statements will be judged based on experience in using:  1) web-based questionnaire administration in studies, 2) complex Adobe Flex-based programming, 3) Dot.Net web services, 4) knowledge of the administration of the US Department of Agriculture's AMPM 24-hour dietary recall, 5) knowledge of the database and probes for the AMPM interview, 6) experience in using ASA24, 7) experience in using web-based voice software, 8) knowledge and experience in administration of national dietary surveys using 24-hour dietary recalls, and 9) ability and experience to conduct a controlled feeding study.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a capability statement, not to exceed 20 total single-spaced pages using a 12 point font size at a minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform, and that addresses the specific requirements described above.  All propriety information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status: this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably place under the eligible small business concern's name and address).  Responses will be reviewed on by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Ms. Jacque Ballard, Contracting Officer at: ballardj@mail.nih.gov  either in MS Words, Wordperfect or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) not later than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thursday, March 26, 2009, 3:30 PM EST.</span></strong> All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.  ANY RESPONSES RECEIVED AFTER THAT DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>

<SUBJECT>MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY SERVICES FOR NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
<SOLNBR>NINDS-09-01
<RESPDATE>041409
<CONTACT>Annette Carter, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-5916, Email cartera@nida.nih.gov - Kirkland L. Davis, Chief, Contracts Management Branch, Phone (301) 496-1813, Fax (301) 402-4225, Email kd17c@nih.gov
<DESC><p>MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY SERVICES FOR NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT - NINDS-09-01</p>
<p>PURPOSE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is interested in identifying Small Business concerns with the requisite capabilities and qualifications to provide the Institute with medicinal chemistry services. The NINDS envisions awarding a contract for medicinal chemistry services as part of a new Medicinal Chemistry for Neurotherapeutics Program (MCNP), which is designed to help overcome barriers to drug development for neurological diseases. The NINDS MCNP would support collaborations between a medicinal chemistry facility (Contractor) and academic or industry researchers (Contributors) with bioactive small molecule compounds and bioactivity assays to develop lead compounds with sufficient potency, efficacy, and drug-likeness to begin the preclinical pharmacology and safety (ADMET) studies required for an investigational new drug (IND) application.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, and if your business concern is NOT a small business, there is no need to respond to this announcement. Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future requirement for a small business set-aside or an open competition to include both large and small business, a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement will be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals.<br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 or fewer employees. Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52-219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Submitted Capability Statements must address how the business meets the applicable size standard designated for this project.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: High-throughput screens and basic research studies have led to the discovery of many small molecule compounds with activity in models of neurological disease. Some of these compounds might be transformed into drugs, with chemical modifications to improve their potency and pharmacological properties. However, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are hesitant to invest in the early development of compounds for rare diseases or new targets, given concerns about profitability and risk. Academic researchers who have identified a promising compound rarely have access to medicinal chemistry services. The NINDS is considering a medicinal chemistry program to overcome these barriers to drug development. This program is envisioned as a collaborative effort between a medicinal chemistry service facility (Contractor) and researchers with bioassays that model neurological disorders and a bioactive small molecule compound (Contributors).</p>
<p>The Contractor would provide:<br />&bull; Medicinal chemistry design and synthesis for chemical optimization studies <br />&bull; In vitro and in vivo assays appropriate for characterizing and optimizing the pharmacological activities of compounds. These may include assays for solubility, metabolic and chemical stability, membrane permeability, inhibition of major metabolic enzymes, and mutagenicity. This program will not include IND-enabling ADMET studies.</p>
<p>The Contributors would provide:<br />&bull; Primary in vitro disease assay that is sufficiently robust and reproducible to reliably detect subtle differences in bioactivity among similar compounds and that is amenable to rapid screening<br />&bull; Secondary disease assay(s) sufficient to confirm the bioactivity detected in the primary assay and to provide sufficient proof of concept to justify clinical testing. <br />&bull; Small molecule compound(s) that show(s) activity in the assays described above and serve(s) as a starting point for optimization<br />&bull; Laboratory staff and other resources to test analog compounds in the disease assays, in the home laboratory, on a routine schedule.</p>
<p>Potential Contributors could apply for access to these medicinal chemistry services. Applications would be reviewed with rapid turn-around. The Contractor would assist Contributors with preliminary studies to determine if the starting compound is amenable to chemical optimization. For the most promising compounds, the Contractor would initiate chemical optimization, involving dozens of rapid, iterative rounds of analog synthesis and testing in close collaboration with the Contributor. Typically, compounds would be tested on a weekly or biweekly schedule, with results of the primary screening informing the subsequent compound design and synthesis by the Contractor. This work must be done confidentially. Contributors would conduct all of the tests involving disease-specific assays and models in their own laboratories. The NINDS anticipates supporting up to eight chemical optimization projects over the course of the contract period, with no more than three underway at any given time.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED: Your response should demonstrate your ability and related experience in a requirement-specific Capability Statement to: 1) Develop and implement strategies for medicinal chemistry optimization; 2) Provide milligram-scale and scale-up synthesis of chemical analogs; 3) Provide appropriate in vitro and in vivo assays if it becomes necessary to explore the Structure-Activity Relationship around a particular pharmacological or toxicological property; 4) Provide data and material management; 5) Rapidly scale chemistry capacity (including dedicated chemistry staff) up or down in order to support anywhere from zero to three chemical optimization projects at any given time, based on the needs of NINDS; and 6) description of a process and terms for handling intellectual property and the transfer of materials and information that would meet the needs of your organization and be attractive to Contributors. The Capability Statement should indicate how many chemists and other staff that the small business would be able to dedicate to such a contract, and which of those would be available in-house. (The contract would support up to eight chemical optimization projects over the course of the contract period, with no more than three underway at any given time. Chemical optimization for a single project is expected to involve dozens of iterative rounds of chemical analog synthesis and testing, on a weekly or biweekly schedule.)</p>
<p>Please submit 3 copies of your response to the attention of Annette Carter, Contracting Officer at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Tuesday April, 14, 2009. Electronic submittal will also be accepted at cartera@mail.nih.gov (please format for printing). You are encouraged to limit you response to fewer than 15 pages and your response must specifically address each of the requirement specific information requested items stated above. Generic marketing brochures will not be considered further. This Announcement is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

The system shall transmit, receive, and record high range resolution, coherent radar data in a field environment. The intent of this system is to collect coherent radar data of surface targets (specifically a boat of 10 dBsm RCS at a range of 10 km) from a fixed position minimal signal corruption, with a signal to noise ratio of ?50 dB.  The system will digitally record the return signal while maintaining signal integrity sufficient for the above intent.
A system controller with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) shall be provided in order to control all functions of the radar and data collection device.  At a minimum the operator of the system shall have control of the RF frequency, pulse-width, pulse repetition frequency (PRF), minimum and maximum range and azimuth for recording, pedestal scan rate, starting time and duration of a record, and record header control.  Indicators shall be provided for the current data rate, sampling rate, current data file size, output file location, and remaining hard drive space.  The GUI shall provide a selection of Plan Position Indicator (PPI), B-scope, and A-scope displays for visual validation of the received pulses.  
The system shall include transmit pulse shaping, RF band-pass filtering, transmit and receive protection, receive blanking, sensitivity-time control, pre-amplification, demodulation, image reject filtering, and IF amplification.  The transmitter shall have sufficient stability in order to differentiate, through post-processing pulse Doppler, a slow-moving surface target (1 m/s) from the background clutter and noise. It must also include instrumentation ports to monitor output power at the antenna and within the receiver chain.  No additional signal processing (i.e. cfar, mti, peak detection, tracking, etc.) is required.
The data collection system shall have the capability to continuously collect demodulated In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) data without saturating the recorder's bandwidth or missing any of the received pulses from the defined data collection region.  The collection region shall be a user defined range and azimuth window and shall be based on the recorder's data rate.  The on-board data storage shall have the capacity to collect 2 hours of data prior to swapping drives.  Full data dictionaries for decoding and performing quick look of the stored data shall be provided.
The antenna system shall be mountable atop a 100 foot telescoping tower restricting its weight and size.  The system shall not weigh more than 400 lbs. All of the other equipment shall be mountable in a 19 inch rack at a remote location to support an antenna / equipment separation of 150 feet.
The system shall be demonstrated at the contractor site prior to delivery.  Real-time operational tests shall include: (1) transmit RF, pulse width, pulse shape and power at input to antenna, (2) display control, and (3) data recording control.

<CONTACT>Scott Shippy, Project Officer, Phone 410-786-2114, Email scott.shippy@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>Introduction

1	Subject

This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes.  This RFI is to assist the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the identification of potential options and to obtain Identity Management Solution vendor and product information for solutions that are able to support Agency requirements. CMS is seeking potential solutions for creating enterprise-level common services for Identity Proofing, creation of an assurance level within a workflow process that can be as generic as a 2-tier approval process to a complex multi-tier process using a delegated chain of trust model, and the collection of necessary information for an application (system) to assign role-based access privileges. The solution should provide services that comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for assurance level 2 as stated in Special Publication (SP) 800-63.   The solution requires knowledge-based Identity Proofing that is not dependent on the use of an individuals social security number.  


Responses to this RFI are due by 2:00 PM local time at the CMS Headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland on Thursday April 9, 2009. 

1.1	Background

CMS is a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Operating Division and is the Federal agency that administers the Medicare program and partners with the States to administer the Medicaid programs throughout the U.S. and Territories.  CMS mission is to ensure effective, up-to-date health care coverage and to promote quality healthcare for the covered people under its programs. 

CMS anticipates the Medicare and Medicaid programs will have increasing business demands for enterprise services supporting requirements for individuals to interact with CMS via some type of online access.  The approximate number of potential users of this system is 4 to 6million individuals. There are approximately an additional 90 million Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries however, they are out of scope for the purposes of this RFI. 

Currently, CMS uses a custom Identity and Access Control system called Individuals Authorized Access to CMS Computer Systems (IACS). CMS has identified a number of major issues with the current implementation including limitation of the base Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) product for Identity Management (IDM) that IACS is built upon related to:

             1.	Scalability  the system will not support the expected CMS user base; and
             2.	Maintainability  Integration of new applications is a costly and lengthy process due to the coding efforts involved

2	Assumptions

             1.	It is recognized by CMS that a single solution or service may not meet all critical requirements and that an amalgam of integrated or connected solutions may be necessary to satisfy the requirements;
             2.	COTS or Government off the Shelf (GOTS) alternatives should facilitate better Federal security compliance through controls and auditing, ease-of-use for CMS customers, easier integration with internal systems and external partners, lower maintenance and upgrade costs over the long-term, etc.;
             3.	Responders should also include some industry best practice solution features that may not be expressly mentioned in this document. These will be considered value added features that are above and beyond our baseline expectations;
             4.	Responders should create a written response to this request for information that addresses each of the requirements set forth in Section 3 of this document.;

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Lafarge North America, Inc, 12950 Worldgate DR STE 500, Herndon, VA 20170-6000.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)-only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Lafarge North America is the only known source that offers Joppa Oil Well Type H Portland Cement that is capable of meeting the Governments requirement.  The Geotechnical and Structural Laboratory, Concrete and Materials Branch (CMB), has been involved in internal and external research efforts to develop and improve ultra or very high-strength concrete mix designs.  This research has required the use of well-controlled and consistent concrete mix materials and admixtures.  Specific materials have been carefully selected for their capability to provide concrete mixes with required levels of ultra-high compressive yield strength.  One of the critical components of the mixture proportions is the Portland cement that is used to produce these mixtures.   Specific cement from Lafarge North Americas cement kiln has been thoroughly tested at ERDC, and a specific concrete mix design has been developed in the labs based on this particular product. Therefore, to continue the research efforts it required that the same cement from the same supplier be used.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. CST on March 13, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Kimberly.L.Dulaney@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.

This Request for Information DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ), nor does this restrict the Governments acquisition approach.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this request.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 511210, Software Publishers.<BR><BR>A response is required from all interested as described in the following  request for information: <BR><BR><BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<BR>PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)  EXCHANGES WITH INDUSTRY<BR><BR>BACKGROUND<BR><BR>The Davis-Bacon Act (DBA requires contractors and their subcontractors working on federally financed or assisted construction contracts to pay workers employed directly upon the site of the work no less than the locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits prescribed by the Department of Labor (DOL).  <BR><BR>All construction contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon Act contain a clause implementing the provisions of the Copeland Act (40 U.S.C. 3145) which requires contractors and subcontractors to 'furnish weekly a statement with respect to the wages paid each employee during the preceding week.'  The DOLs implementing regulations at 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(ii) requires contractors weekly to submit a copy of all payrolls to the Federal agency contracting for or financing the construction project. A signed `Statement of Compliance' indicating the payrolls are correct and complete and that each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the proper DBA prevailing wage rate for the work performed must accompany the payroll.   <BR><BR>DOLs regulations at 29 CFR 3.3(b) also require each contractor to furnish each week `Statements of Compliance' to the Federal agency contracting or financing the project.  With this 'Statement of Compliance' contractors and subcontractors  certify their payrolls by attesting that persons performing work on Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) covered contracts have received the proper payment of wages and fringe benefits  The regulations at 29 CFR 3.4 and 5.5(a)(3)(i) require contractors to maintain these records for three years after completion of the work.. Contracting officials and Wage and Hour Division staff in Federal agencies use these certified payrolls to verify that contractors pay the required rates and as an aid in determining whether the contractors have properly classified the workers for the work they perform.<BR><BR>PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<BR><BR>As part of a continuing effort to reduce paperwork and resulting  burdens on both contractors and the Government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is interested in determining the feasibility of allowing contractors and subcontractors performing on its Davis-Bacon Act covered construction contracts to file their weekly certified payroll statements in electronic format through web-based technology.  FAR Subpart 4.5, Electronic Commerce in Contracting, provides that 'agencies may accept electronic signatures and records in connection with Government contracts.'  The Corps wants to obtain performance and cost information about existing electronic, web-based Davis-Bacon Act payroll systems that incorporate all applicable DOL regulatory requirements. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED<BR><BR>All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the requirements in the Potential Requirements Table (attached) are invited to submit a Capability Statement and their contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the products capabilities as they relate to the Corps potential requirements, the products system requirements, the products integration specification (if available), cost information (e.g., transactional, subscription, etc.) and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers understanding of the information submitted.  <BR><BR>Respondent systems must comply with DOL Regulations (29 CFR Parts 3 and 5) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 22, Subpart 4 and Contract Clause 52.222-10, Compliance with Copeland Act Regulations. In particular, respondents should also complete the Potential Requirements Table which contains provisional requirements for USACEs Electronic Davis-Bacon Act Payroll initiative.

STATEMENT OF WORK

SCOPE:
----------
The contractor(s) shall provide training and other relevant instructional support for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).  The primary objective of this requirement is to maximize the pass rate for employees completing the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification examination.

DFAS operations are worldwide.  The majority of the finance and accounting work is performed in Indianapolis, Indiana; Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; Rome, New York; Arlington, Virginia and Limestone, Maine.

DFAS senior management is placing increased emphasis on the workforce attaining professional certifications relevant to the organization.  For government accountants and other financial management professionals, the CMA has been identified as a certification of particular importance.  DFAS is establishing CMA study groups to support employees in successfully achieving their CMA certification.  Examination preparation training and other support provided by the contractor will be an important component in ensuring the study groups success.    
 
REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------------

NOTE:  References, and any other source deemed appropriate by the Government, will be asked to comment on the performance and effectiveness of the contractors personnel/instructors.

An evaluation will be conducted for each offeror based on the offerors performance under existing and prior contracts.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources  including sources other than those provided by the offeror.  

    
(2) PRICE:
-------------
Prices should be provided as a firm fixed price (FFP) per student.  
Offers submitted on other than a FFP per student basis may be rejected.  

Travel will be determined on an as needed basis.  Consequently, travel costs are unknown and will not be evaluated/calculated as a price factor.  Travel costs will be reimbursed at cost as described in the SOW.

The contractor will be responsible for the reproduction and shipment of course materials.

It is anticipated that class size will range from ten to thirty students.  DFAS will ensure a minimum of 10 students per class.

Vendors are to provide pricing information as reflected in Exhibit 1 below (or in the same format).  During evaluation, out year prices will be considered in the evaluation and will be added to the first year prices to determine a total evaluated price.  Offerors are allowed to submit up to a maximum of 5 pages of supporting information on their price; however this is not required.  All pages after the first five pages, regardless of whether they are title pages, tables of content, etc., will not be evaluated.  These pages should be properly identified at the top of each page as Pricing Information.

Prices will remain in effect for a full year.  A tentative schedule of classes will be provided for each annual year.    Option year prices will be adjusted annually on 01 May (or the date of award if later than 01 May) of each succeeding year (i.e., 01 May 2010, 01 May 2011, 01 May 2012, and 01 May 2013) and will remain in effect for that respective year.  
 
Prices should be provided as a firm fixed price (FFP) per student  based on a class size of 20 students.  If you have a tiered pricing structure in which the FFP per student depends on the number of students in a class, please provide the FFP per student for each tier separately, e.g., 10-15 students, 16-20 students, etc.  If tier pricing is provided, it will be used for pricing each scheduled class.  However, for purposes of evaluation, pricing is to be based on a per student cost assuming the class size will be 20 students. 
Offers submitted on other than a FFP per student basis may be rejected.

Complete the table below using your FFP per student (assuming the class size will be 20 students) of providing instructor-led training to prepare students to take and pass the four sections of the CMA examination.

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years. (months)(years).

(End of Clause)


52.222-46 -- Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees.
As prescribed in 22.1103, insert the following provision:

Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (Feb 1993)

(a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Governments best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offerors ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. 

(b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.

(c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the Contractors ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements.

(d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal.

(End of Provision)


52.237-2 -- Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation.
As prescribed in 37.110(b), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for services to be performed on Government installations, unless a construction contract is contemplated:

Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (Apr 1984)

The Contractor shall use reasonable care to avoid damaging existing buildings, equipment, and vegetation on the Government installation. If the Contractors failure to use reasonable care causes damage to any of this property, the Contractor shall replace or repair the damage at no expense to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs. If the Contractor fails or refuses to make such repair or replacement, the Contractor shall be liable for the cost, which may be deducted from the contract price.

(End of Clause)


Section 508 Compliance
------------------------------
DAS 52.39-9000 Representation of Compliance with the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards  (May 2003)
(a) Submission of the representation referenced in paragraph (b) and (c) is a prerequisite imposed by 36 CFR 1194 for making or entering into this contract.
(b) By submitting an offer or quote, the offeror represents that the products and services offered in response to this solicitation comply with the Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) Accessibility Standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless stated otherwise within the quotation or proposal.

DFAS 52.223-9000, ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS (OCT 2007)

The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Governments polices on Green Contracting.  FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Governments policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals.  Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agencys Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.  

The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.

In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.   

 2  	Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors product/service.
When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm,
(a)	the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.  
(b) 	The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.

 2  	Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.  
(a)	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)  	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.

DLAD 52.204-9003 VENDOR SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (JUN 2008)

(a) Work to be performed under this contract/task order may, in full or in part, be performed at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) HQ or other field activity office(s), i.e., physical access to a Federally-controlled facility. DLA and its field activity offices require all contractor personnel working on the Federally-controlled facility to have a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check (NAC) prior to beginning work on a contract. Additionally, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Programs, and Defense Logistics Agency Regulation (DLAR) 5200.11, DLA Personnel Security Program, all DoD consultants and contractor personnel who have access to Federally-controlled information systems must be assigned to positions which are designated at one of three sensitivity levels, IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. These designations equate to Critical Sensitive, Non-Critical Sensitive, and Non-sensitive, all of which require performance of a NAC. (Note: Non-Critical Sensitive -IT 2 now requires a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) and Critical Sensitive - IT1 require Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)) 
(b) At the option of the Government, previously completed security investigations may be accepted in lieu of new investigations if determined to be essentially equivalent in scope to the required NAC. The length of time elapsed since the previous investigation will also be considered in determining whether a new investigation is warranted. In order to assist the Government in making this determination, the contractor must provide the following information to the contracting officer immediately upon receipt of the contract. This information must be provided for each contractor employee who will perform work on a Federally-controlled facility and/or will require access to Federally-controlled information systems: 
(1) Full name, with middle initial
(2) Social Security Number 
(3) Citizenship status 
(4) Date of Birth
(5) Place of Birth
(6) Proof of the individuals favorably adjudicated background investigation or NAC, consisting of identification of the type of investigation performed, date of the favorable adjudication, and name of the agency that performed the investigation. 
(7) Company name and address
(8) Company phone and fax numbers
(9) Company email address
(10) Location of on-site workstation or phone number if off-site (if known prior to award)
(11) Delivery order or contract number and expiration date
(12) Name of contracting officer
(c) The Government will notify the contractor as soon as a determination is made regarding acceptance of the previous investigation. If a new investigation is deemed necessary, the contractor will be notified of such by the contracting officer or contracting officers representative (CO/COR). It is the contractors responsibility to ensure that adequate information is provided and that each contractor employee completes the appropriate paperwork in order to begin the investigation process. The contractor shall submit each request for investigation, through the CO/COR, to the DLA site Security Office. Requests shall include: 
(1) Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) (SF 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions). This form, as well as instructions for completion, is available at www.dss.mil.) 
(2) Fingerprint Card, (DD Form 258); the DLA site Security Office will perform all fingerprinting.
(3) Proof of Citizenship (birth certificate or passport are acceptable, and must be the original or a certified copy.)
(4) Appropriate documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service if the applicant is a foreign national.
Required documentation, set forth above, must be provided to the DLA site Security Office at the time of fingerprinting. 
(d) Upon completion of the NAC, results will be forwarded to DLA HQ Command Security, Personnel Security Division (DSS-SC) for review and determination regarding the applicants suitability to occupy the specified position in performance of the DLA contract. Contractor personnel shall not commence work on this effort until the NAC has been favorably adjudicated. Results of investigations now go to DISCO, not DES-SC.
(e) A waiver to allow assignment of an individual to commence work prior to completion of the NAC investigation may be granted in emergency situations when it is determined that a delay would be harmful to national security. A request for waiver will be considered only after the Government is in receipt of the individuals completed forms. The DLA site Security Office and the contracting officer reserve the right to determine whether a waiver request will be forwarded for processing. The individual requesting the waiver may not be assigned to a position, e.g., physically work at the Federally-controlled facility and/or be granted access to Federally-controlled information systems, until the waiver has been granted.
(f) The requirements of this clause apply to the prime contractor and any subcontractors the prime contractor may employ during the course of this contract, as well as any temporary employees that may be hired by the contractor. The Government retains the right to request removal of contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status whose actions, while assigned to this contract, are deemed to conflict with the interests of the Government. The reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the contracting officer. When and if such removal occurs, the contractor shall assign qualified personnel, with the required NAC, to any vacancy thus created. 
(g) All contractor personnel who are granted access to Government Federally-controlled information systems shall observe all local automated information system (AIS) security policies and procedures as provided by the DLA site Information Systems Security Officer. Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations, or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will result in removal of the employee from Government property and referral to the contractor for appropriate disciplinary action. Actions taken by the contractor in response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the contractors performance assessment for use in making future source selection decisions. In addition, based on the nature and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination. 
(h) The contractor is required to obtain a Common Access Card in accordance with procedures established at the DLA HQ or field activity office. 
(i) When a contractor employee is removed from the contract, the contractor shall provide an appropriately trained substitute who has met the NAC requirements of this clause. The substitute may not begin work on the contract without written documentation, signed by the contracting officer, stating that the new employee has met one of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (e) of this clause, i.e., acceptance of a previously completed security investigation, satisfactory completion of a new investigation, or a waiver allowing work to begin pending completion of an investigation. Individuals removed from this contract as a result of a violation of local AIS security policy are removed for the duration of the contract. 
(j) The contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, within 12 hours, when an employee working on this contract resigns, is reassigned, terminated or no longer requires admittance to the Federally-controlled facility or access to Federally-controlled information systems.
(k) These vendor security requirements do not excuse the contractor from meeting the delivery schedule set forth in the contract, or waive the delivery schedule in any way. Contractor shall meet the required delivery schedule unless the contracting officer grants a waiver or extension.

<DESC>Pursuant to the information advertised on November 13, 2008, The U. S. Department of State, Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) Program has a requirement to enhance the capacity of qualified African Nations to participate in internationally mandated peace support operations (PSO) and contingency operations in Africa.  The purpose is in accordance with U.S. Policy Objectives supporting the United Nations, the African Union, African Regional Economic Communities, the African Standyby Force Concept and Individual Troop Contributing Countries.  The ACOTA Program will pursue its purpose of enhancing the PSO and contingency operations capacities of selected African Nations in three ways.  First the ACOTA program will directly train and equip African Peacekeepers, Peacekeeping and Contingency Operations Contingents, and associated staffs at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.  Second, the ACOTA program will train African PSO trainers so as to enable African partners to indigenously conduct PSO training over the long term with minimal outside assistance.  Third, the ACOTA program will sustain an effort over the long term to mentor and assist indigenous training, provide updated "instructor cadre" refreshment training, provide limited equipping for training purposes, and upgrade training facilities.  One important feature of the ACOTA program is that the training and equipping programs for each African partner nation are uniquely tailored to meet the nation's special training, equipment and infrastructure needs, peacekeeping deployment plans, mission specificity, and national, regional, and African stand-by force (ASF) requirements.  The uniquely tailored training and equipping programs are achieved through close collaboration with the partner nation's planners, officials and leadership.  The contractor's program manager and one other permanent official assigned to the contractor's ACOTA program shall have a current secret secuirty clearance.  All other contractor personnel performing the specific work described in this statement of work are not required to posess a security clearance.  The contractor shall maintain the capability to purchase, store, pack and transport from CONUS to the training location, all equipment necessary to support each training activity.  The Department of State intends to award 3 or more IDIQ training contracts by conducting an unrestricted/partial set-aside, full and open competition, with one award set-aside for service disabled veteran owned small business.  We anticipate a one year contract with four option years.  Telephone request for the solicitation will not be accepted.  All questions must be submitted via email to Jay Zagursky at ZagurskyJJ@state.gov. All questions must be received no later than Thursday, April 2, 2009.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR> High Performance Research FT-IR Spectrometer Package<BR><BR>All those responding must do so in writing to each of the requirements that follow with an explanation of how their proposed system meets, exceeds or differs from the specification. The statement MEETS SPECIFICATION without written supporting documentation as a response is unacceptable.<BR><BR>The FT-IR spectrometer must be optically flexible and user serviceable.  The instrument software must operate under Microsoft XP Professional or Windows Vista for future PC upgrades.  The instrument must be capable of performing all of the following specialized, hyphenated sampling techniques: GC-IR, TGA-IR, and FT-Raman Spectroscopy all in a single componentized system by the addition of optional modules that attach to the instrument and utilize the same software.  Instruments that cannot perform all of the techniques in a single system will limit our future research projects and are not acceptable.  The system must also be field upgradeable to do AM step-scan, PM step-scan, simultaneous multiple modulation step-scan, time-resolved step-scan, step-scan imaging, and dual channel measurements.<BR>Considerations and Requirements<BR>1.	We currently have an extensive investment in accessories and external infrared detectors that we must be able to continue using on the new instrument.  The only way that we can properly use them, is if the infrared beam height and diameter of the new instrument matches that of our current FT-IR.  Many of the accessories are no longer manufactured, so specialized adapters are not even available to modify them for use on any other FT-IR design than the one we currently own and operate. The spectrometer must therefore have the exact beam height and shape to allow us to use our current sampling accessories and detectors.  <BR>2.	We have amassed years of spectral data through the instruments acquisition software.  The data files are extremely important to our past and more importantly, our current research projects.  We therefore require that the new instrument use the same software that we currently use to open and process these files with.  We currently own over $20,000 in commercial Infrared Spectral Libraries that we have purchased over the years that can only be accessed through the software that we currently own and operate on our FT-IR spectrometer.  It is therefore a requirement that our new instrument use the same software that we currently use.<BR>3.	The spectrometers interferometer that we currently own uses a continuous scan 90-degree Michelson interferometer.  The interferometer employs an active digital dynamic alignment system based on laser detection feedback for optimal system performance and maintenance of accurate line shapes.  Digital dynamic alignment improves scan to scan repeatability, enhances long and short term stability and ensures that the optical system maintains optimum alignment.  The system stability is extremely important to our research in that we scan for extremely long periods to collect data.  Without this type of advanced intrascan corrections based on the Helium Neon finges, our data collection will suffer.  It is therefore a requirement that our new instrument employ the same level of sophistication that the FT-IR that we currently own does.  Passive systems that rely solely on having both interferometer mirrors mounted on a single plate and not correcting for thermal or environmental changes within the interferometer are not acceptable.  Interferometers that rely solely on cube corner retroreflectors for tilt compensation are not acceptable owing to their reduced performance due to shear effects.<BR>4.	We currently use automatic interferometer alignment, which is required for periodic system optimization and it is completely computer controlled.  We therefore require that the new FT-IR spectrometer to operate in the same manner.  Under no circumstances shall the only mechanism for adjusting the interferometer be limited to an on-site service call.<BR>5.	Our current spectrometer possesses a monolithic, pinned in place optical design such that optical integrity and alignment are maintained throughout the life of the instrument.  The spectrometer mirrors do not incorporate nor require any adjustment screws to effect alignment.  Our current experiments also require a higher level throughput.  It is therefore a requirement that the new FT-IR possess all gold coated, pinned in place optics.The optical design must include a single parabolic mirror between the beamsplitter and the sample chamber, and a single ellipsoidal mirror between the sample chamber and the detector to ensure maximum energy throughput of the system.<BR>6.	We will also be performing many high resolution sampling experiments.  We therefore require that the system includes an iris controlled aperture that is programmable from the system software.  The aperture must include 150 discrete aperture positions to optimize performance for a variety of experimental conditions and system configurations. Systems that use a manual aperture are not precise enough for our needs.  We will also be conducting many IR polarized experiments that will require a specialized IR polarizer that is internally mounted in the instrument and software controlled. <BR>7.	The system must include a software controlled automated attenuation screen wheel to select varying levels of light attenuation with 4 windows that let 100%, 30%, 10% and 3% of the energy through to the sample compartment.<BR>8.	We will be conducting many experiments outside of the main instrument sample compartment. We require that the new system must be able to pass a collimated, modulated infrared beam from the interferometer to exit the spectrometer on the right side, the left side or the front of the optical bench.  None of the external beams may traverse through the main sample compartment of the spectrometer.  Selection of the external beam must be made under computer control. We also will be doing fiber optic sampling externally and require that a dedicated fiber optic launcher and 10 meters of bundled fiber cable be installed on the instrument outside of the sample compartment.  Since fiber optic cables are extremely fragile, we require that the new instrument have a dedicated fiber optics launcher and detector that do not have to be removed from the instrument to perform other types of sampling.  An in-sample compartment fiber optics launcher is not acceptable for our research needs.<BR>9.	The mid-infrared source shall have electronic temperature control allowing the user to select one of three operational modes.  The source shall be warranted against failure for five years.  The source must be pinned in place and be completely user replaceable.  The visible light source that is included as well, must be software selectable and user replaceable as well without any specialized manual alignment.<BR>10.	The HeNe reference laser must be pinned-in-place, pre-aligned and completely user replaceable without the use of an oscilloscope.  The laser must be coaxial with the infrared beam to insure accurate infrared peak positions and must be visible in the main sample compartment to aid in the alignment of samples and accessories.<BR>11.	The connection of spectrometer to computer must be made using industry standard USB 2.0 connection for the fastest possible data transfer.  USB 1 or Ethernet connections that require an IP address are not sufficient and do not meet industry standard.<BR>12.	The standard resolution of the spectrometer shall be better than 0.125 cm-1 apodized, 0.09cm-1 unapodized (Triangular or Happ-Genzel) measured full width at half height (FWHH) using a gas sample of CO at 4 torr pressure. The instrument must include all of the hardware (sources, beamsplitters and detectors) and software to cover from the far infrared to visible spectral range (50 to 25,000 cm-1). The instrument must include DTGS, InGaS, and MCT-A detectors. <BR>13.	The interferometer mirror control must be capable of providing physical mirror scanning velocities from 0.15 cm/sec to 6.3 cm/sec. The spectrometer must be capable of achieving rapid scanning scans speeds of  up to 65 scans/sec at 16 cm-1 resolution with the interferograms must be written directly to disk and not stored in memory.The spectrometer shall be capable of achieving a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 50,000:1 peak-to-peak in a one minute measurement time at 4 cm-1 resolution with triangular apodization using a KBr beamsplitter and TGS detector.  A 25% increase in throughput must be seen using the Turbo source energy mode.<BR>14.	ASTM Linearity:  The spectrometer shall provide less than 0.07% deviation from 0.0%T (100%-0% scaling) for the optically thick peaks in 3 mil thick polystyrene when measured at 4 cm-1 resolution.<BR>15.	The instrument must have cast-in storage holders for two additional beamsplitters in addition to the beamsplitter that is installed in the interferometer.  These spare beamsplitters must be contained within the sealed and desiccated or purged environment of the spectrometer and must be at thermal equilibrium with the interferometer to allow for rapid beamsplitter interchange and stability.The installed beamsplitter must be automatically recognized by the system upon installation.  The beamsplitter must be aligned to better than 95% of the optimal alignment within 10 seconds or less after having been installed in the instrument.  The system must be ready to use within 10 seconds after the new beamsplitter has been installed.<BR>16.	The included liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector must have an extremely high detectivity of at least 6.5 E10 cm1/2/W for our experiments that require high sensitivity, the dewar must be manufactured out of stainless steel and guaranteed to be free from artifacts due to icing.  Because many of our experiments will take a very long time to perform, the detectors dewar should provide a hold time of up to 18 hours for unattended overnight operation.<BR>17.	In addition to our currently owned accessories, we require the new instrument include all of the necessary hardware and software needed to be able to perform the following experiments:<BR>"	Transmission  standard transmission sampling with sample windows made from KBr, BaF and ZnSe windows.<BR>"	Diffuse reflectance including KBr powder, sampling cups and gold reflectance reference for high sensitivity experiments that we will be performing, SiC reference and sampling discs.  We also will be performing environmentally controlled experiments that require a dual environmental control chamber that is capable of performing diffuse reflectance experiments.  The chamber must allow for vacuum of 10-5 Torr and pressure up to 1500 psi.  The temperature range must go from ambient to 900C.  Software must control the temperature ramp and the instrument scans frequency at various temperatures.  The entire set up must be complete integrated into a single unit and interface to the instrument control software.<BR>"	A gemstone quality, Type 2A diamond ATR accessory must be included with a spectral range from 100 cm-1.  We will be performing specialized experiments by ATR that require access to much lower energy vibrations.  We require a pure diamond ATR  not a diamond/ZnSe laminate that will limit our spectral range.<BR>"	Mid-IR Fiber optics launcher with 10 meters of fiber optic cable.<BR>"	Purge gas generator that supplies a minimum of 36 SCFH of carbon dioxide and water free purge gas to the entire system.<BR>"	Near-infrared diffuse reflectance by fiber optics<BR>"	Polarized variable angle specular reflectance experiments with a range of 30 to 83 degrees from normal.  This should include all sample masks and reflective substrates required to perform polarized thin film analysis.<BR>20.	Our experiments require that we are able to display the interferogram in real time prior to co-averaging of the sample scans.  This will allow us to ensure that we are getting the spectral quality information from the sample prior to launching the collection event.  The new instrument should be able to provide a live spectral scan of the sample system prior to the collection event launch.<BR>21.	We require a software tool that can independently apply an ATR correction to the spectra collected by ATR.  This feature can be controlled by the end-user and not automatically applied.  Our experiments will require us to choose when to apply it and when not to.<BR>22.	Additional standard software features that we currently use on our FT-IR must included with the new instrument as well.<BR>	Automatic and manual baseline correction, ability to save interferogram(s) and post process the data, ability to control the source energy between three operational modes, straight-line generate, blank region, interactive spectral subtraction, automatic and manual smoothing, spectral derivative calculations, multiply, add, peak find with threshold and sensitivity adjustment, peak annotation, automatic noise computation, file management for storing and grouping spectra, interactive Fourier Self Deconvolution, palette of icons tools for region select, peak height, peak area, cursor and annotation, Kramer's Kronig dispersion correction, ATR Correction, Kubelka Munk computation, overlaid or stacked spectra displayed with common matched or offset scaling, X-view box for displaying entire spectrum, box and zoom, roll and zoom, spectra scaling for all spectra in a window, multiple spectra displayed in one or multiple windows, bi-directional JCAMP-DX support, XY pair and ASCII data text file format spectral file support (CSV).<BR><BR>23.	We will be conducting extensive IR Microscopy experiments that require and very precise aperture to ensure spectral quality is not compromised.  We therefore require that the included IR microscope employ the use of dual-remote aperturing.  This means that there is an aperture pre-sample and an aperture post-sample in both the reflection and transmission sampling modes and uses the same aperture for both pre- and post- sample aperturing.  This is critical to microscopic applications as the aperture is the key to eliminating stray light caused by diffraction of the IR<BR><BR>24.	The supplied IR microscope must include infinity corrected optics and the tools required to perform DIC enhanced spectral illumination.  This means that other than the objective and condenser, there are no focusing mirrors or optics in the entire system until the IR beam is focused onto the detector.  This allows us to get a better visual image of the samples we will be analyzing.  DIC will assist us with finding specific features in our samples.  We also require that the IR microscope be able to perform Fluorescence illumination by the use of optional fluorescence illumination cubes and filters.  We require and IR microscope that can have this capability added at any time later as our sampling needs change.<BR><BR>25.	Our research experiments also require that the IR microscope include a slid on ATR accessory that can me easily slid into and out of position for micro-ATR sampling.  Since we will be using various materials in our samples, we need to be able to remove the ATR accessory and inspect the crystal surface for contamination.  We therefore require that the ATR accessory included with the IR microscope be designed to slide in and out for easy inspection and cleaning without the need for any special alignment each time.  <BR><BR>26.	We will be performing mapping on our samples as well as micro-ATR mapping.  The instrument must include all hardware and software required to perform both techniques unattended.  The stage must have a very high precision to perform very small, sub-micron step sizes for the most accurate maps of the sample.  Micro-ATR mapping must be controlled automatically so that we can perform large area maps unattended.<BR><BR>27.	Our experiments will require that we have the ability to survey the sample image and collect IR data simultaneously in transmission.  We will need to be able to move the stage automatically to a sample spot and see the change in the IR spectrum simultaneously in order to pinpoint the exact location that we want to collect data from.  We must also have complete visualization of the entire field of view, including the sample spot, when the aperture is set to the appropriate size and rotation via the video display in the software as well as through the eyepieces of the microscope.  The view is not obscured by overlaid glass aperture lines or any other visual artifacts. <BR><BR>28.	To account for extreme differences in particle sizes of our samples, we require that the system include a 4-place rotatable nosepiece with a 10X, 40X glass objective and a 15X Infinity corrected objective.  Each of the IR objectives should have continuous compensation capabilities to allow for adjustment of the focal length of the lenses to adjust the spectral quality when we sample on the supplied IR transparent windows.<BR><BR>29.	The IR microscope should also include a diamond windowed compression cell that will allow for compaction of very hard to compress materials that we will be researching.  This compression cell will save considerable time and effort in the preparation of our samples.<BR><BR>30.	The entire FT-IR Microscopy system should be fully warrantied for 2 years, parts labor and travel.  Installation must be performed by factory trained and certified service personnel.<BR><BR>31.	The interferometer and mid-infrared source must be covered by a full five year warranty. The source, HeNe laser, power supply, and detectors must all be completely user replaceable without the necessity of a service visit.  No optical alignment or alignment tools should be required to replace these components.<BR><BR>32. 2 days of  on-site training by an instrument specialist must be included for the complete system. In addition, a 3-day software training course for 2 people must be included at the manufacturers site.<BR><BR><BR>

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

SPECIAL BUSINESS QUOTATION INSTRUCTIONS

The Government anticipates that the work will be performed at the contractors facility.  
52.212-2  EvaluationCommercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government intneds to award a Best Value Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined by the Government to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs.  In determining which offer represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following factors in descending order of importance.  

1.	Technical Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on how it proposes to provide the printing services required.  The offeror should present their approach to meeting the requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the project and to allow OPM to evaluate their approach. 

Your narrative should, at a minimum:

(1)	Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPMs operations needs;
(2)	Discuss the anticipated methodology to complete the work listed in the requirements;
(3)	Discuss methodology to meet the requested delivery time frames; and
(4)	Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise, particularly those issues that impact deliverable deadlines.

2.	Past Performance 

Your corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

We will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.  No more than three references are required.
The following considerations will apply to the evaluation of past performance: 

	Quality of Product or Service: compliance with contract requirements - accuracy of reports - and technical excellence.

	Timeliness of Performance: met interim milestones - reliable - responsive to technical direction - completed on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed.

	Cost Control: within budget - current, accurate, and complete billings - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies.

	Business Relations: effective management - reasonable/cooperative behavior - flexible - business-like interest for the Governments interests. 

	Customer satisfaction: satisfaction of end-users with the Contractors services. 

Assessment of offerors past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the quotation, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. 

Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the offerors commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 

If an offeror, or its proposed employees, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor. 
3.	Price

Price, while neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting a contractor under this Request for Quotations.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.
	
(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">This is a combined commercial synopsis/solicitation, (HSFEEM-09-Q-0018) supplemented with additional information included herein (SOW Attached). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes, as a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms for up to a total of 128 "room nights" for participants attending the FY 2009 Homeland Security Preparedness Technical Assistance Program (HSPTAP)/Enhancing Grants Management Technical Assistance Program Workshop in Atlanta, GA. DHS/FEMA has scheduled the conference for April 28-29, 2009. The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 60 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 21 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 FEMA EGMTA Workshop," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to pay for their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The "Grand Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which the conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms should be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors should also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest cost offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the night periods separately, and a Grand Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be technically acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Award will be made to the offeror who is technically acceptable with the lowest price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror's quotation will be subjected to the following "Go/No Go" criteria:<br /><br />(1) The offeror must demonstrate ability to provide the requested number of guest rooms/nights and associated conference facilities as described in the SOW on the dates indicated, (2) be within 25 miles of the Atlanta, GA airport, and (3) The offeror must be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. </span></p>

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008.

<DESC><p>This is the first amendment to the original presolicitation notice for Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 posted on 24 November 2008. This amendment makes several changes. It includes a Safety Act statement, an updated release date, more information on the bidder's library, and a small business statement. The Global Systems Positioning (GPS) Wing will release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) on or before 31 March 2009. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category ID program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1.0 and 2.0. Block 1.0 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1.0 capabilities, Block 2.0 will integrate GPS IIIA satellite capabilities (L1C) into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C), on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 45 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Response from small business and small disadvantaged businesses is encouraged.<br />BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.</p>
<p>The DoD mandates the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than a username and password, before granting access.</p>
<p>In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the aforementioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components:</p>
<p>(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software.</p>
<p>(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate<br />http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html</p>
<p>This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. <br />OMBUDSMAN: The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and FAR 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), GPSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>
<p>No further notices for this solicitation will be posted unless release of the RFP has been delayed beyond 31 March 2009.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers on Pre-Solicitation Notice W912DR-09-R-0043<BR><BR>Q1.   USACE previously advertised Solicitation Number W912DR-08-R-0057 for a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for design-build and construction projects in support of the RSFO.  This solicitation has been on hold pending release of another amendment and establishment of a proposal due date.  Is it possible that this A-E IDIQ will be used in preparation of design-build RFPs that would in turn be handed to the SATOC contractor for design-build project delivery?<BR><BR>A1.  Paragraph 1 - Contract Information indicates where this contract may be used. Paragraph 2 - Project Information indicates what this contract may be used to perform. Paragraph 2 states, THE WORK MAY CONSIST OF site investigations, planning, master planning, programming, feasibility studies, surveys, geotechnical investigations, permitting, charrettes, AND THE PREPARATION OF reports, studies, design criteria, DESIGN BUILD REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, designs, and other general A-E services for multi-disciplined new construction projects, alterations, renovations, maintenance and repair, tenant fit-up and operations for military, and other, non-military government agencies.<BR><BR>Q2.  Can A-Es selected for this A-E IDIQ choose to not participate on certain tasks depending on project type and size?<BR><BR>A2. The selected contractor is required to submit a proposal for each requested task order.<BR><BR>Q3. I was reading the synopsis of the solicitation number (W912DR-09-R-0043) and the information shown in the fbo.gov is too general and does not provide enough information for bidding the project.  In order to provide a fee proposal we need to know if there is any set of schematic drawings available or a document describing the scope of work more in depth.<BR><BR>A3. As stated in the Synopsis in Paragraph 4  Submission Requirements, This is not a request for proposal. Please do not request a solicitation package for this project. This is strictly Architect Engineering, (NAICS Code 541330) submittals of SF 330s only.<BR>

<DESC>In furtherance of its requirement to evaluate the automotive restructuring plans and provide recommendations regarding the automotive industry, Treasury sought assistance in assessing (a) the current automotive sector generally (including but not limited to, stakeholders or constituencies that are either directly or indirectly impacted by the automotive sector), and (b) the February 17, 2009 GM and Chrysler restructuring plans submitted to the Government.  Such assistance will include, but is not limited to, reviewing and analyzing a great deal of information about the automotive sector broadly, and GM and Chrysler specifically either through resources held by the Government and its contractors, the Contractor, or otherwise acquired at the Contractors expense.  Specific matters to be reviewed and analyzed include, but are not limited to: anticipated market size and car sale volumes over a five year period; market share considerations for GM and Chrysler; competitive dynamics within the automotive industry; pricing, cost and margin prospects for GM and Chrysler.  Other work related to these topics may be required, as the process of assessing these companies and the automotive sector generally unfolds
