<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (41 U.S.C. 3305, 3306, and Chapter 37); FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (41 U.S.C. 1906 and 1907)); and FAR 37.104, Personal Services Contracts (Public Law 103-332, Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, Title II, September 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 2530 as implemented by 25 U.S.C. 1638c). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ)-10-16-010-REL. The solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 561320 and the small business size standard is $27.5 million.<br /><br />PRICE SCHEDULE: MID-LEVEL PROVIDER (NURSE PRACTITIONER OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT: 1500 hours @ $______________ per hour = $____________________.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: January 2, 2016, through September 30, 2016.<br /><br />WORK SCHEDULE:<br />8-hour shifts: Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.<br />Occasional Evening Clinic Rotation:<br />10-hour shifts: Monday - Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.<br /><br />LOCATION OF THE CONTRACT: The Mid-Level Provider Services are located at the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Center, 420 North Cheyenne Avenue, Lame Deer, Montana. STATEMENT OF WORK: Examines and diagnoses health related conditions of individuals presenting themselves for care; refers individuals for consultation when appropriate; prescribes and carries out therapy in conformance with approved clinical privileges and Billings Area/Indian Health Service policy. The mid-level provider educates individuals in the nature of health-related conditions, recommended therapy, and the general promotion of health and prevention of illness/diseases. Conducts initial and periodic health examinations for finding physical defects in need of correction, and prescribes and implements remedial treatments required to correct these defects. Orders immunizations to patients in compliance with established Indian Health Service and Billings Area policy. Makes necessary arrangements and authorizes admission of patients to the appropriate hospital. This includes authorization for admission to contract facilities for emergency medical care and surgery. Keeps the Service Unit Director or designee informed of Contract Health Service/Purchase Referred Care (CHS/PRC) admissions. Records patient-provider transactions in the problem oriented Electronic Health Record and completes required data collection instruments, referrals, and medical records as required. Refers patients and their families to Community Health Services personnel as appropriate for their continued care and follow up. Participates, as required, in Service Unit/Area meetings to develop new, modify existing, and evaluate medical procedures and processes relative to assurance of quality patient care. KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: The mid-level provider will see and provide medical care to all persons presenting to the clinic for medical care. The provider will possess a physician assistant degree or Advanced Practice Nursing license and be able to care for, in an appropriate manner, all patients who present to the clinic. These skills are outlined but not necessarily limited to the skills outlined in the clinic privileges packet. The provider will make an accurate, readable, and complete record of all patient encounters in the Electronic Health Record. SUPERVISION: The Supervisor defines the continuing assignment with procedures and methods to be used, priorities and deadlines. The Supervisor helps the provider with difficult or controversial aspects of the job requirement. The provider uses initiative in planning and carrying out the day-to-day workload. Final work is reviewed for conformance to policies and regulations, timeliness and satisfaction of the Supervisor. The Supervisor or his/her designee will assist the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in monitoring the contract. The responsibility of the Supervisor is to supervise, monitor and ensure the provider is adequately performing the requested services, deliverables, duties and responsibilities in accordance with the work statement and performance standards. The Supervisor will monitor workload, completeness of charts, timeliness of the provider, and peer review of the provider's work output. Failure to maintain a positive working relationship with the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit staff and patients; maintain good readable records in a timely fashion; and work within the scope of standard medical practice for a physician assistant/nurse practitioner will result in termination of the contract. SUPERVISOR: Chief Medical Officer; ALTERNATE: Medical Officer. GUIDELINES: The guidelines the mid-level provider will follow are provided in the Medical Staff by-laws and the orientation book containing our standard operating procedures in the clinic for common situations that arise with patients in our unique situation. Otherwise, the provider will care for patients in a professional and competent manner of any licensed physician assistant or nurse practitioner. COMPLEXITY: The job will consist of managing a panel of assigned patients and working with a Primary Care Team to provide caring, consistent and standardized medical care. The job could possibly become very complex with the provider caring for patients with multiple chronic health problems and many difficult to manage prenatal patients. The job will require coordinating care for patients with in-house ancillary departments and between outlying facilities and also between Patient Referred Care Services and other third party billing companies for revenue reasons. SCOPE AND EFFECT: The mid-level provider will be fulfilling the mission of the Indian Health Service in providing medical care to the Native American population on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. PERSONAL CONTACTS: The mid-level provider will be working with an assigned Primary Care Team and other medical providers in the Clinic and in the Emergency Room for coordination of care. At times, the provider will be making contact with the BIA police, EMS staff, tribal social workers and Public Health Nurses. There will be interactions with lab and x-ray personnel, tribal behavioral health, general clinic staff, and administrative personnel as well as the janitorial and security staff, and just about anybody else who works in the building. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: With the appropriate personnel, the mid-level provider will be sharing medical information about the patient so as to provide excellent medical care for the patient. Otherwise, the provider will be maintaining a positive working environment with the other staff. PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The mid-level provider will need to be able to care for several patients that will be presenting through an appointment system or Walk-In Clinic system. The provider must be able to do the physical skills as requested on the clinic privilege form, and to do these things without endangering the patient in any way. WORK ENVIRONMENT: The Service Unit will provide the mid-level provider with a neat and clean emergency room equipped to handle routine treatment of the patients who present. The Service Unit will also provide the necessary forms and medical records for the provider to document the visits. The Service Unit will provide computer use with Internet access to be used for work related searches. The nursing staff and x-ray and lab are provided during their routine work shifts. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Northern Cheyenne Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: Pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the contractor will be required to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). This training must be completed annually by all employees including all contractors, volunteers, students, and summer externs. The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors" and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel. Access/clearance to all pertinent computer systems, including completing the Security Checklist, Rules of Behavior form, Security training; and if necessary, a Business Partner Interconnection Security Agreement (BPISA), should be coordinated with the Service Unit. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR): The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractor's technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract. INVOICE SUBMISSION AND PAYMENT: The Contractor shall submit its invoices to the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107, with a courtesy copy to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractor's name and address; (2) Contact name, title, and telephone number; (3) Contract Number; (4) Invoice number and date; (5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed; (6) Remit to Address; (7) Taxpayer Identification Number (Employer Identification Number or Social Security Number); and (8) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (to ensure payment is made to the correct bank account) and vendor mailing address, as provided in the System for Award Management (SAM), formerly known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107. PRO-CHILDREN ACT OF 1994: The Contractor certifies that it will comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-227, Pro-Children Act of 1994, which imposes restrictions on smoking where federally funded children's services are provided. CHILD CARE NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK AND INVESTIGATION (CNACI). A CNACI must be completed for all Indian Health Service (IHS) contractor personnel within the Billings Area. Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities. The character and background investigations will be conducted by the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the mid-level provider is allowed to work. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards. Federal Tort Claims Act coverage for medical related claims is extended to the individual providing the services. However, the services must have been performed within the scope of the personal services contract. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition. The FAR provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Northern Cheyenne Service Unit is a small ambulatory outpatient clinic with 24/7 emergency room services. The Service Unit is not an inpatient facility and patients needing inpatient services will be transferred to the nearest Indian Health Service facility 40 miles away or to Billings, Montana which is 100 miles away. This contract is to cover services in the Outpatient Clinic.

The physician educates individuals in the nature of health-related conditions, recommended therapy, and the general promotion of health and prevention of illness and diseases. Conducts initial and periodic health examinations for finding physical defects in need of correction, and prescribes and implements remedial treatments required to correct these defects. Administers immunizations to patients in compliance with established Indian Health Service and Billings Area policy. Makes necessary arrangements and authorizes admission of patients to the appropriate hospital. This includes authorization for admission to contract facilities for emergency medical care and surgery. Keeps the Service Unit Director/Chief Executive Officer or designee informed of Purchased/Referred Care (formerly known as Contract Health Service (CHS)) admissions. Records patient-provider transactions in the problem oriented medical record format and completes required data collection instruments, referrals, and medical records as required.

Routine duties shall include providing medical care and public health services to individuals eligible for services provided by the Indian Health Service in homes, schools, clinics, job sites, and other community locations within the Service Unit. KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED BY THE POSITION: The physician, in addition to a thorough knowledge of the general medical fields including working knowledge of the major primary care fields of internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, in order to treat a majority of patients, must possess a specialized knowledge of the concepts, principles and practices of Family Practice, such as is obtained through the successful completion of a course of study leading to a degree of Doctor of Medicine degree or Doctor of Osteopathy degree from an approved school of medicine or osteopathy and the successful completion of post-graduate training in family practice in an approved residency program. Also, requires board certification. Must possess a license to practice medicine in the United States. Must be eligible to be certified in the family practice specialty.

SUPERVISION: The supervisor assigns work in terms of objectives to be met, with little or no instruction. Technical guidance is provided by contract consultants in the special areas of medicine. Work accomplished by the physician is considered definitive, technically authoritative and usually accepted without review.

In addition, traditional and currently accepted medical practices are available in the form of specialty consultation, medical journals, and textbooks. In nearly all cases, however, the physician's judgment is the key factor in determining whether guidelines are to be adhered to or deviated or whether guides need to be developed to protect the interests of the patient. COMPLEXITY: The work consists of a broad general practice of medicine, involving diagnosis and treatment of inpatients and outpatients with an extremely wide variety of physical and emotional problems and includes the broad functions of medicine: education, prevention, cure and rehabilitation, in addition to the practice within the Family practice specialty. Assignments are characterized by breadth and intensity of effort and generally involve the simultaneous application of multiple distinct skills, knowledge, and abilities in the care of one or more patients. The work is often difficult and further complicated by the fear and skepticism of patients, undefined or ill-defined problems presented in advanced stages, and conflicting data. The work requires continued efforts to establish programs to resolve chronic medical problems among the population served. SCOPE AND EFFECT: The work of this position effects the health and well-being of individuals on an immediate basis; and impacts the health status of the community on a broad basis. PERSONAL CONTACTS: Personal contacts are with patients, other employees, representatives of other Federal, State and Tribal health organizations, and administrators and physicians from the private sector. These contacts are made with individuals and occasionally groups in moderately unstructured setting. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: The purpose of contacts with individuals and groups is to educate, influence, and motivate the individuals and groups to understand and to accept recommended medical therapies.

Work in a medical facility includes exposure to communicable diseases, intoxicated and/or violent patients. Personal protective equipment and guidelines to prevent disease transmission are provided. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Northern Cheyenne Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties.

The character and background investigations will be conducted by the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the physician is allowed to work. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards. Federal Tort Claims Act coverage for medical related claims is extended to the individual providing the services.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
