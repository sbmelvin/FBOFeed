<DESC>The USDA, ARS intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a seven month contract with two three month options, Firm Fixed Price IDIQ contract for facilities operations, maintenance and administrative support services at four locations in the South Atlantic Area with Four Seasons Environmental, Inc.(FSE). The contractor is required to provide maintenance, alternation and repair of building structures, grounds maintenance, automotive and farm vehicle maintenance, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, pipefitting, housekeeping, safety, security guard and administrative support services effective July 1, 2004. Award of a bridge contract is required for the following reasons. The services are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-on contract to extend the service for the continued highly specialized services. No other offeror could immediately perform all of the required services within the timeframe and without incurring substantial cost. FSE is the only feasible source for these services because any other contractor would incur excessive projected duplicated cost and schedule risk to provide the services. This site is under a modernization effort and the contractor is required to interface with other contractors onsite. The SAA mission is to develop through basic applied and developmental research, new knowledge and technology that will ensure an abundance of high quality agricultural commodities. The research is conducted on agricultural commodities to improve safety of foods and feed, emerging and exotic infectious poultry diseases and foods borne pathogens of people, improve citrus scion and research on rootstock varieties that have enhanced tolerance or resistance to environmental stresses that are valuable to the U.S. economy. This research involves the reliance and cooperation of the local community, other countries and government agencies. The contractor is responsible for maintaining the facility in full support of the research mission. FSE is the only feasible source for maintaining continuity of services in support of the mission. The government is in the process of redefining its requirements. To that end, it is vital to the research mission of the SAA that the incumbent continue to provide O&M support. No solicitation will be issued.  No telephone calls are being accepted. Questions can be emailed kpitts@ars.usda.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Biological Resource Discipline, has a requirement to determine species and individual identity of black and grizzly bear hair samples.   Intent is to award a Requirements type contract which includes a base year plus one option year.  USGS will provide samples to be analyzed to determine species and individual identity of non-invasively collected putative black and grizzly bear hair samples using microsatellite markers. Contract is for the analysis of approximately 5,200 samples with an option to add another 34,800 additional samples.  Work includes the microscopic inspection of each hair sample to screen out obvious black bear hair and those samples without a sufficient number of follicles to warrant extraction, isolation of follicles, extraction and amplification of DNA, and screening out of black bear samples by use of a genetic marker. Genotyping at 7 microsatellite loci will be used to identify individual grizzly bears.  For each individual bear identified, gender and a 16-locus genotype shall be determined using additional markers.  Stringent measures must be taken to prevent, detect, and control genotyping error. This is a highly contentious issue which may be litigated therefore comprehensive, credible and defendable scientific data will be essential. Requirement is not set-aside for small business.  It is anticipated that a copy of the Request for Proposals will be posted electronically and available for downloading on or about April 30, 2004 with proposal due May 31, 2004.  Offerors shall be required to submit a technical and cost proposal for evaluation.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a Call Order under Scaled Composites, LLC BPA No. E05479D for commercial "Wet Lease" of the Proteus Aircraft and other Proteus Related Aircraft Services.  Requirements are to integrate the NASA JPL, Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument into the NASA DFRC Double Q-Bay pod and perform a validation test flight with the Proteus Aircraft.  NASA/DFRC intends to contract for these services directly from Scaled Composites, LLC, Mojave, CA under the terms and conditions of BPA No. E05479D.	The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  "Justification is based upon Scaled Composites, LLC's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services involving both the Proteus Aircraft and the NASA DFRC Double Q-Bay Pod.  The Proteus is a one-of-a-kind aircraft that was designed and manufactured by Scaled Composites, LLC.	Additionally, the Proteus is the only existing aircraft that offers the payload, performance, and endurance capabilities necessary to meet the requirements of the High Altitude Airborne Science Program.  The NASA DFRC Double Q-Bay Pod was designed and manufactured specifically for utilization on the Proteus Aircraft.  Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements.  The Government intends to acquire these commercial services using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 26, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.	All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Direct Attack Program Office, submits this pre-solicitation notice in preparation for award of a Sole Source contract to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company.  The two objectives of this contract are to provide a “pathfinder” to explore technology and/or process issues associated with implementing a weapon data link (WDL) on the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), and to support a proposed WDL Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), currently in the planning stages.   

In order to perform these efforts, a contractor must be very familiar with the SDB weapon system and modes of operation, and must have access to the SDB weapon system technical data package (TDP), including all of its sub-components, and the SDB 6-DOF model.  This is necessary to understand the SDB performance characteristics and weapon system interfaces in order to determine if potential precision guidance technologies can be integrated with the SDB weapon system design.  The Government does not own/possess a TDP for the SDB weapon system nor will the Government provide one to complete this effort. The contractor must be able to complete the effort not later than 31 Dec 2005.  Interested firms who believe they have the capability to perform this effort should respond with details of their qualifications, experience, and how they will gain access to the SDB TDP (in accordance with Numbered Note 26).  Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether or not they are a small business concern or small disadvantage business concern, as defined in FAR 52.219-2.  In the event this notification results in a contract action, the acquisition will utilize North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code, 332993.   For information concerning this synopsis, please contact Ms. Jeffrey Duval, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-3525, extension 2545, e-mail: jeffrey.duval@eglin.af.mil.    For technical information, contact the Program Manager LtCol Greg Gutterman (850) 882-7321, e-mail: gregory.gutterman@eglin.af.mil or Project Lead Engineer, Mr. Eddie Gibbs, (850) 882-7321, extension 3356, e-mail:  george.gibbs@eglin.af.mil.  This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.    See numbered notes 22, 23 and 26.

<DESC>NUWCDIV Newport intends to award a Fixed Price contract to High Test Laboratories, Inc., Arvonia, VA for the shipping, refurbishment, equipment installation, testing services, and storage facilities required to support the underwater explosive shock testing of the TTL TACTOM AUR on the SSN 688 Class and SSN 774 Class Submarine shock test fixtures.  The intent of this testing is to shock qualify the TTL TACTOM AUR for SSN 688, SSN 774, and SSN 21 Class Submarines.  The tasking shall consist of 1) Shipping of GFE barges and shock test fixtures from Aberdeen Test Center, MD to Hi-Test Lab facilites; 2) Barge and shock test fixture refurbishment and shock test fixture installation; 3) Setting up a work area with velocity meters, test instrumentation cabling and high speed video; 4) Conduct UNDEX Shock Tests; 5) Test Results Report; 6) Contingency Operations/Emergency Repairs; 7) Secure Stowage of the TTL TACTOM AUR classified SECRET; 8) Optional Testing:  Testing under the basic contract will include 10 tests.  However, in anticipation of the need for additional tests the contractor shall provide cost options for each additional UNDEX test on a per test basis; 9) The contractor shall provide an estimate for data recording and cabling for 32 channels of GFE instrumentation for each shot.
The basis for the sole source is that the shock test fixtures were constructed by the principal owners and operators of what is now High Test Laboratories (HTL).  The TTL TACTOM UAR qualification test objectives require the Navy to obtain the shame shock response as that obtained during historical Navy conducted FSP testing.  To achieve this goal, the test fixtures must be restored to their original as build condition to the maximum extent possible.  The shock tests are already calibrated to HTI’s test facility.  Thus the refurbishment and repair of these fixtures must be conducted by those directly involved with the initial design, construction and test of the fixtures, which are unique to HTL.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NAICS:  541380.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
ON PROTECTION FOR SPACE MISSION ASSURANCE
(AS OF 8 APRIL 2004) The National Security Space Architect (NSSA) is gathering information regarding protection for space system mission assurance.  For the purpose of this RFI, “architecture”, “space system mission assurance” and “protection” are defined as: Architecture is the structure, relationships, and principles governing design and evolution of components linked in accomplishing a purpose. Space mission assurance is those actions taken to provide a desired level of confidence that NSS and supporting capabilities will be available on demand, free from malicious or unintentional disruption and manipulation or exploitation for intelligence/targeting purposes, and in sufficient quantity and quality to support critical user needs.  The desired level of confidence may vary from mission to mission and user to user.  Protection, along with other actions, enables overall mission assurance. Protection is active and passive defensive measures to ensure that U.S. and friendly space systems perform as designed by seeking to overcome an adversary’s attempts to negate and to minimize damage if negation is attempted. The goal of protection is to secure space systems’ capabilities and enable space mission assurance by ensuring the availability of space capabilities in all operating environments.  Protection involves the application and integration of capabilities to: 
·Detect, locate, characterize, and identify threats;
·Detect, attribute, and report malfunctions and attacks;
·Avoid, defend, withstand or mitigate unintended interference, environmental / natural hazards, and hostile attacks;
·Reconstitute or repair mission capabilities; and
·Assess mission impact of attacks.
The information will be used to assist NSSA in developing architectures proposed for use in 2025.  
The NSSA is responsible for developing architectures across the range of National Security space mission areas.  The architectural process integrates future needs and a broad spectrum of future military, civil, and commercial capabilities into candidate architectures; conducts independent analyses to assess the merits of each architecture; and presents recommendations and an investment strategy to the Undersecretary of the Air Force for Space/Director, National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Space Senior Steering Group consisting of:
-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD/NII);
-Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management (DDCI/CM); and
-Director, Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment Directorate (J8), Joint Staff
This RFI seeks information that will help the NSSA assess protection capabilities employed, planned, or proposed by national security, civil, and commercial organizations.  Of particular interest are innovative practices, concepts, standards, technologies, non-materiel applications, and associated commercial architectures.  Specific questions are:
a.How would you characterize your customers’ needs for protection?
b.How would you characterize your protection capabilities in regards to these threat classes:
1.Unintentional interference
2.Environmental hazards to space, information link, and ground segments
3.Hostile attacks against space, information link, and ground segments
c.What is your overall approach to changing your own capabilities in response to changes in customer needs, new technologies, or demonstrated threats?
d.How are you planning to improve your protection capabilities in these areas?
1.Space-based capabilities
2.Terrestrial capabilities
3.Non-materiel aspects including policies, procedures, and operations concepts
e.What standards are you considering developing, establishing, or implementing to support long-term, mid-term, and short-term protection for mission assurance?
f. What technologies do you plan to use to achieve, maintain, or improve long-term, mid-term, and short-term protection?
g. What technologies do you consider high payoff for future protection capabilities, including those without current space funding support or government sponsorship?
h. To what extent should autonomy or automation be implemented in ground and space systems to support protection?
i. Which commercial capabilities do you believe could be used to enhance the protection of government space capabilities?
j. What type of capabilities do you anticipate using to support the protection of your space-based capabilities in the future?
k. What international cooperation do you intend to pursue in the future to achieve better space protection?
l. What interrelationship do you plan or desire to have with the government in the future from a space system mission assurance perspective?
m. What interest do you have in providing selected services for protecting government space operations?
n. What interest do you have in providing a full range of protection services to the government?
o. Have you developed a space mission assurance analytic framework for evaluating protection capabilities across the space, information link, and ground segments?
p. What analytical tools or simulations would you recommend for assessing the performance, cost, and utility associated with protection for space system mission assurance?
q. Identify the top five challenges or issues that you feel must be addressed to achieve protection for space mission assurance.
Responses should describe current protection capabilities, anticipated changes in future levels of protection, and recommendations for architectural options for assuring space missions effectively meet customers’ needs given projected man-made and natural threats in the 2025 timeframe.  
Request contractors interested and capable of performing these functions submit the following information:
1)A capability package, limited to 20 pages or less, that includes:  
a.Contractor information to include, but not be limited to, the Contractor’s name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Advanced Technology Institute (ATC), Core Genotyping Facility (CFG) intends on procuring on a sole source basis with M.J. Research, 5350 Capital Court, Suite 102, Reno, NV 89502 to provide one year maintenance service for existing government owned Tetrad Thermocycling systems.  This procurement is being processed based on FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  THe CGF assesses human genetic variation, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and other types of genetic variation (microsatelites, insertion/deletion mutations etc.) in a large number of separate population and family studies initiated by NCI investigators.  Currently the CGF is utilizing four major technology platforms to assess human genetic variation: 1) Taqman Fluorescent 5' Nuclease cleavage, 2) Primer Extension detected by Matrix Assisted Laser Deionization/Adsorption - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) nucleotide extension, 3) Fluorescent DNA fragment analysis and sequencing detected by automated capillary electrophoresis systems, and 4) MGB EClipse 3' Hybridization Triggered Fluorescene.  To accomplish this goal, NCI CGF  is expected to implement a combination of high-throughput platforms and automated sample manipulation.  The NCI CGF focus is on several well-established, high-throughput combinations of genotyping platforms and chemistries, all of which depend on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).  PCR and extension reactions are accomplished in 96- and 384- well MJ Tetrad Thermocycling systems.  In order for NCI CGF to reach its expected production milestones all the M.J. Research systems must work constantly for up to 10 hours every day. With a maintenance agreement in place with M.J. Research, this would assure the NCI CGF continued production.  The Tetrad Thermocycling systems are sensitive instruments that oftentimes require technical assistance, which require experienced person to repair.  M.J. Research is the only known source to the NCI researcher that can provide such services to the aforementioned system.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished material must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT (Local Washington, D.C. time) on May 3,2004.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: APRIL 16, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04M000128

INTENDED SOURCE: HARVARD UNIVERSITY-JOHN F. KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWELVE  MONTHS


THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO HARVARD UNIVERSITY-JOHN F. KENNEDY
SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT.  CLOSING DATE IS APRIL 30, 2004.

BACKGROUND:

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) was established by the 1992 ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law 102-321) and reauthorized by Public Law 106-310.  It is a component of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services.  Congress created CMHS to bring new hope for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbance.  CMHS leads Federal efforts to treat mental illnesses by promoting mental health and by preventing the development or worsening of mental illness when possible.

The Division of State and Community Systems Development, through the mental health block grant, provides assistance to States in the development of comprehensive community based systems of care for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbance.  In addition, to the dissemination of block grant monies to the States, the block grant set-aside monies support technical assistance activities and training activities that assist State personnel in the development of their systems of care.  Assisting in the development of the leadership at the highest levels in the State mental health authorities has been a major goal of the Federal government in the administration of the mental health block grant program.

Since 1988, the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors have joined together to provide executive leadership training for State Mental Health Commissioners and Deputy Directors.  The training provided under this program has helped the State/Territorial leadership confront what has been called Aone of the most difficult jobs in the public sector.@

The program has consistently received high ratings by the Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, has become a standard and highly valued component of the national meetings and has assisted in the development of the partnership between the States and the mental health block grant program.  The quality of the programs is due in no small part to the fact that its development is the shared responsibility of the senior staff of NASMHPD, which is attuned to the needs of the Commissioners and the Harvard faculty which have access to the academic community at Harvard and other universities.  The academic community contributing to the program includes psychiatry and psychology, public management through the Kennedy School of Government, and business administration.  In each program, formal presentations by CMHS leadership have introduced the new Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners to the SAMHSA programs.  The experience gained over the years by the continuity of program direction has been a major factor in its success.

The resulting training has focused on some of the most complex aspects of managing a State mental health authority.  Due to the projected turnover it is expected that, 20-25 Commissioners and or Deputy Commissioners will qualify for this training.

A critical aspect of the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) agenda is to provide leadership in supporting the training activities of leaders of mental health service systems.  This Program for Executive Leadership in State Mental Health Administration has two specific aims:	
	-To enhance the leadership skills of State mental health agency directors and deputy directors.
	-To improve the managerial and program competence of state mental health agency directors and deputy directors. 




SCOPE OF WORK:

Specific Requirements

Task 1: The contractor shall provide professional training services for newly appointed State/Territory mental health Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners (those who have not previously attended the seminar in conjunction with their current appointment).  Specifically, the contractor will provide training that explores major management and leadership issues facing these leaders, including, mission and values, internal management; working with consumers; families, and advocates; current thinking in the provision of services to persons with serious mental illness; health reform; the role of CMHS; working with the governor, legislature and media; and using data to effectively lead an organization.

Task 2: Specifically, the contractor shall also provide for a forum where experienced commissioners share their pitfalls and successes.  Experienced current and former directors of state mental health agencies, adding outside resource faculty as needed, will lead this training.

Task 3. Based on discussions with NASMHPD staff and representative State commissioners, the contractor shall propose to the project officer, training curricula to be offered at the twice-yearly meetings of NASMHPD. These Commissioner/Deputy Commissioner’s Enrichment Seminars can focus on an array of topics such as Trends in Managed Care, Effective Use of Governing and Advisory Boards, and The Use of Outcome Measures.

Task 4. The contractor shall provide an evening seminar during each of the twice-yearly meetings of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, (NASMHPD).  This program will be offered to all State commissioners and Deputy Directors attending the NASMHPD meeting.  These seminars will include guest lecturers, case studies panel discussions or presentations on current management and leadership issues of interest to State Commissioners.

Task 5. The Contractor shall produce for the above courses a number of case studies, and other written materials to benefit new and current State commissioners and Deputy Directors. This material will then be made available to the National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC) and the SAMHSA Web Site for wider dissemination.

Task 6: The Contractor shall arrange for all of the logistics necessary to implement these activities, including travel, hotel, per diem and arrangements for appropriate meeting rooms.

Task 7: The GPO and Director of the Division of State and Community Systems Development will be informed 2 months prior to each seminar of the date and location of the seminar and will receive copies of all correspondence with the States/Commissioners regarding these activities.	

Task 8: The Contractor shall note in all correspondence and materials that this activity is funded through the CMHS Division of State and Community Systems Development with mental health block grant set-aside funding.  The Director of the Division of State and Community Systems Development will be invited to participate and address participants at the training session.  It is expected that the Division Director, or her designee, will represent the mental health block grant program to engage in a dialogue with participants regarding the block grant program and compelling State mental health issues.

Task 9. The Contractor shall provide a final report to the Project Officer on the activities undertaken in this professional service contract.

				
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

In completing this unique project, the government expects the training programs to be delivered to the leaders of States’ mental health systems to be of the highest quality available.  In order to ensure that excellence, it is pursuing a sole source contract with Harvard University.  Harvard University is the nation’s oldest institution of higher education and one of its most prestigious universities.  

Harvard University in conjunction with the John F. Kennedy School of Government, the Department of Psychiatry of the Harvard Medical School, and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors is uniquely qualified to undertake the training of senior staff of state mental health agencies.  For over thirty years, Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government has been a national leader in the training of mid-career senior officials of Federal, State, County and Municipal agencies.  Since 1985, the school has recognized the importance of training the senior staff of State mental health agencies in the complex areas of system change, public mental health policy development, and the organization and financing of systems of care.  Since that time, the Kennedy School has devoted significant faculty resources to the development of educational programs and materials targeted to this unique group of State officials. Likewise, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors serves the State mental health agencies in a significant role.  

 NASMHPD is the only national association representing state mental health commissioners and their agencies.  As such, NASMHPDserves as an essential and trusted source of information for state mental health commissioners/deputy commissioners regarding best practices in the
delivery of mental health services, effective management practices and financing mechanisms for state mental health agencies, and important policy issues that drive public mental health systems.  NASMHPD provides consultation, technical assistance, and opportunities for education on a
broad range of topics.  NASMHPD's mission ensures that its work plan and priorities are driven by the technical assistance and information needs deemed most relevant by state mental health agencies.

Most importantly, NASMHPD provides a critical forum for open dialogue and the exchange of information among peers.  NASMHPD has long fostered an environment in which newer commissioner/deputy commissioners can learn from more experienced colleagues; states can share experiences and expertise to improve systems across the country; and experts in the field, including consumers, families and advocates, can work directly with states to incorporate important research findings into systems design and practice.

Thus, this unique collaboration between Harvard University and NASMHPD that has developed over the years is targeted to meet the needs of the leaders of public mental health systems.  This relationship has consistently produced training curricula that are relevant to State mental health agencies and assisted in their ability to provide quality-training programs and advance the purposes of the mental health block grant.  

Harvard University, using its highly effective case study method of learning, will develop case studies specifically to be used in training the Commissioners in the intricacies of how government works, how public policy is made, and problem solving for the most difficult issues facing managers in government.  These case studies address topics identified as highly relevant to these administrators.  For example, these include cases addressing the reallocation of resources from state institutions to community programs (Massachusetts Federal Court Case); large-scale state system reform (Ohio Mental Health Case); the stigma of mental illness and community acceptance of people with mental illness (Maine Group Home Case); and, ensuring the adequacy of state hospital resources (Colorado State Hospital Case).  In addition to these case studies, the school has developed several monographs that specifically address the role of senior staff in complex state bureaucracies, such as Bromides for Managers or When a New Manager Takes Charge. 

Harvard University and the Kennedy School have also developed a cadre of faculty members who have extensive experience in teaching State mental health agency staff.  This faculty includes former directors and senior managers of State mental health agencies who are able to use their personal knowledge and experience about these complex jobs to address significant problems encountered by their peers.  This peer-to-peer learning is unique in schools of government, and has been part of the success of the Kennedy School has had in translating the theory of public administration into practice.  The Kennedy School=s commitment to the senior level administrator is also important in that it recognizes the contributions that this level of staff can have within government, and in the professional development of these managers for future directorships within the State mental health agency.

CMHS recognizes that quality mental health care requires a close attention to management and administration and skillful leadership.  CMHS has a history of collaboration with the States to ensure that these mental health systems are planned, developed, and administered with the best knowledge, skill and expertise available.  This training, which is only available from Harvard University in collaboration with NASMHPD, will enhance the participants in their leadership of State governments in the development of quality mental health care delivery systems.  CMHS knows of no other provider who can meet the requirements of this procurement.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to enter into a sole-source contract with Innovative Imaging, Inc. for the procurement of three 16.8I 4KX4K Digital Camera System, three J50-Upgrade To 50’ Cable Option, two 4.2i Digital Camera, two Nikor Lens, and five Pd2x-Ltd Frame Grabber Software. The Megaplus 16.8i was designed specifically for NGA’s requirements, and has been in place for approximately eight years.  The Megaplus 16.8i has a best digital image resolution of 3 microns (which is the same as original film).  This camera allows the operator to achieve almost instant corrections of obliquity.  Market research has shown that the Megaplus 16.8i is the only 4K high-resolution digital camera with a monochromatic sensor that will meet the exacting imagery standards of the Digital Imagery Production Section.  Award to any other source is anticipated to result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  It is essential that the replacement cameras be procured quickly to avoid interrupting mission critical activities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Firms that recognize that they can perform the required services described above may identify their interest and capability.  Firms are to identify themselves, include business name, point of contact, address & telephone number, and provide written supporting evidence to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis. The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources will be given full consideration. Only written responses will be considered.  Responses should be submitted to Jonathan Mostowski, Contract Specialist, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816, mostowsj@nga.mil or faxed to 301-227-1461.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting a Full and Open competition to acquire the services of qualified U.S. Contractors to provide services to support vocational and technical training in general, and employment services in Iraq, specifically.  In response to Iraq’s high unemployment rate, USAID/Iraq will procure technical assistance to help the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) implement a broad scale workforce development initiative.  The Contractor, using experienced personnel, will assist, in coordination with USAID, the Coalition Provisional Authority, and MOLSA, with the  implementation of  a two-year base contract (with two one-year option periods) to establish and operate 17 vocational and technical training centers and 28 employment centers throughout Iraq.  Prior to developing a work plan to establish these centers, the Contractor will conduct a rapid labor market study throughout Iraq that will compare vocational and technical skills needed by the local private sector with the existing skills and abilities of the local workforce.  Such an analysis will enable the contractor to develop vocational training programs tailored for local private sector needs that bridge the skills gap.  The contractor will also provide necessary training to MOLSA staff to ensure a smooth transition of the centers operation from the Contractor to MOLSA before the end of the contract.

The period of performance for this contract is estimated to be two (2) years from the date of award of the contract.  NAIC:   611 Education Services.

The preferred method of distributing the USAID Procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about April 2, 2004.  It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error(s) resulting from downloading.  All correspondence regarding this notice must be submitted in writing.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice of intent and a written notice of intent will not be issued.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Three Springs Scientific for African green monkeys of St Kitt origin, for respiratory Syncytial Virus Research.  The Notice of Intent number is being issued as NOI4059.  This Notice of Intent document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-22.  The NIAID, NIH, has a requirement to purchase approximately fifty (50) Cercocebus Aethiops (African green monkeys) St Kitts-PIV and approximately fifty (50) crates for transporting the African green monkeys. These items are to be delivered to the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland via FOB Origin.  This is a small disadvantage business and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 112990 and the small business size standard is $0.75 million.  The NIAID is involved in numerous projects for Bio-Defense vaccine development and most recently since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  The NIAID is tasked with the main research in NIH on the study of SARS and to develop a vaccine.  Studies in the NIAID focus primarily on viruses that play an important role in disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the liver, and the reticuloendothelial system. Currently, NIAID employs the techniques of viral genetics and molecular biology to express protective viral antigens and attenuate viral mutants that may prove useful for prevention of disease. A number of promising live attenuated viral vaccines and virus-specific immunotherapies are under development and evaluation.  The NIAID conducts research directed toward defining the cause and epidemiology of medically important viral diseases and developing means for their control. NIAID engages in a wide range of research activities that extends from identification and antigenic characterization of viruses that cause systemic disease or acute disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the liver to basic molecular studies of viral structure, function, and genome organization. Scientists in the laboratory employ molecular biologic techniques to elucidate pathogenesis of disease as well as to develop purified subunit antigens and attenuated viral mutants for use in prevention of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and systemic viral diseases.  The approximately 50 listed Cercocebus Aethiops (African green monkeys of St Kitt origin) have been identified and serologically screened and are seronegative for Parainfluenza Viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and HMPV.  African green monkeys are the most sensitive for detecting and evaluating infection with PIV 1, 2, 3, and HMPV.  RVS has increased needs for this species of non-human primate to test the potency of new lots of candidate PIV 1, 2, 3 vaccine, determine the dose response to this vaccine, explore the feasibility of post-exposure vaccination, examine cross-protection and measure the duration of protective immunity. NIAID studies are in anticipation of preparing PIV 1, 2, 3 vaccines for human use.  Large numbers of African green monkeys are required so the lots of vaccines can be characterized before human clinical trials begin.  Since Three Springs Scientific has supplied African green monkeys to NIAID in the past they must continue to provide these specific African green monkeys in order to compare data analyses and maintain consistency in the results.  The necessary items are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12.

The estimated price range is $60,000,000-80,000,000. A bid bond is required.    This solicitation  is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public bid opening. This procurement will result in a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The design and technical criteria contained and cited in RFP establish minimum standards for design and construct ion quality. The solicitation criteria rely predominately upon military standards for barracks, headquarters buildings, and company operating facilities to meet program specific requirements for the Army's Program.  The objective of this solicitation is to  obtain a fully functional brigade-sized barracks complex.  The complex includes two 240 pn Barracks buildings, five company operations facilities, eight hangar company operation facilities, three battalion headquarters with classrooms, a brigade headquart ers, a troop aid station, and a dining facility.  The successful Offeror must design and construct a complete and useable facility, as described in the RFP documents.  The successful Offeror must have submitted a clear and concisely written proposal that g ives the Government the greatest confidence in the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to meet the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s requirements in an affordable manner.   Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of project requirements and a commitment to performance in accordance with the RFP in all aspects of project execution.  A site visit will also be scheduled, date/time to be determined, for the Offerors, p rior to submittal of proposals, at which time Offerors will be allowed to examine the site.  The evaluation team will use the Color Coding system, which uses colors to indicate the degree to which the offeror's proposal meets the standards for each factor evaluated.  Evaluators will identify strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies and risks and prepar e narrative statements in order for the contracting officer to make selection decisions. The evaluation process essentially consists of the following parts: proposal compliance review, technical/quality evaluation, price evaluation, cost/technical trade-off analysis and final determination by the Source Selection Authority (SSA)/Contracting Of ficer.  To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.  Proposals will be evaluated on RFP compliance, past performance and technical merits.  Price proposals will be evaluated  on price only.

Each offer will be measured against the requirements of the RFP technical, non-technical, and price in accordance with the RFP solicitation, which includes technical qualifications, management plan, and technical proposals. This part of the evaluations is conducted without the related price proposals.  The evaluation process will include an assessment of risk--primarily in the  areas of quality, cost, and schedule.  The price analysis is conducted in accordance w ith FAR part 15 by a separate team.   Technical factors are listed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3, and so on.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center is seeking qualified sources to perform EVALUATION OF USCG 140’ WTGB MAIN ENGINE MODIFICATIONS.

The United States Coast Guard 140’ WTGB icebreaking tugs are equipped with two Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 naturally aspirated opposed piston diesel engines for main propulsion.  Each DC generator set is rated at 1,000 ekW @ 850 rpm.  The opposed piston diesel engines have proven ideal for the heavy loading associated with icebreaking.  However, the cutters also spend considerable time operating under extreme light loads.  Under extended periods of light loading the engines pump high quantities of lube oil into the exhaust system and emit high opacity smoke from their exhaust stacks.  The exhaust oiling is both an environmental and safety concern.  

Fairbanks Morse Engines has developed a prototype modification package that is hoped will maintain the engines responsiveness, reliability, and power under icebreaking conditions, but dramatically reduce both the smoke opacity and exhaust oiling problems under light load.  The prototype modification package is being installed in conjunction with a full overhaul on a single engine onboard CGC KATMAI BAY (WTGB 101).  CGC KATMAI BAY is home ported in Sault Sainte Marie, MI.  

The USCG Engineering Logistics Center is conducting market research for awarding a technical support contract to help plan and execute the evaluation of the installed modification package.  Contact Tom Gahs, USCG Engineering Logistic Center, phone 410-762-6291, email Tgahs@elcbalt.uscg.mil for additional information.  Replies are requested by 23 Apr 2004.

THIS IS A ONLY A REQUEST FOR SOURCES AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>Description:  This is a sources sought synopsis for 8(a) concerns for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  Small Businesses, HUBZone, and other socio-economic concerns may also submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work which will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether an 8(a) set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) requires information assurance support services to ensure that the components of MSC’s IT systems and networks are operating effectively and securely according to Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Navy (DoN), United States Transportation Command (USTC) and MSC policies and procedures.  This includes: monitoring and maintaining MSC’s perimeter network security components, intrusion detection support services, Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM), incident response and reporting, infrastructure configuration management, and managing MSC’s Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP).  The estimated labor hours are 19,000 hours per year.

This is an initial contract.  This acquisition will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541513, which establishes a small business size standard of $21M.

The proposed acquisition strategy for this requirement is fixed price level of effort term with a one-year base period and four one-year options.

MSC is soliciting input in the form of capability statements specifically from 8(a) concerns. As stated above, Small Businesses, HUBZone, and other socio-economic concerns may also submit capability statements which will be reviewed if sufficient 8(a) interest is not received.

These components consist of Firewalls, Domain Name Servers, Proxy Servers, SMTP relays, Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices, Niksun NetVCR NetDetector devices, Routers and Switches.  Day-to-day management includes monitoring the actual devices, applying appropriate Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) patches, troubleshooting, maintaining current Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), preparing waiver requests for submission to DoD, DoN and USTC, and coordination with MSC’s Global Helpdesk (GHD) and MSC’s IAVM team. Management and maintenance includes ensuring that all of MSC’s perimeter network security components are operational and functioning properly and in accordance with all policy 100% of the time.  The goal is to protect MSC IT assets and provide a means for auditing the MSC network to ensure adequate implementation of information security measures.

Task 2:  Contractor is responsible for day-to-day management of MSC’s Intrusion Detection System (IDS).  DoD, DoN, USTC and MSC policy mandates the use of an IDS to provide perimeter protection.  MSC’s IDS is deployed throughout MSC’s enterprise and is strategically placed at each of our sites.

<DESC>COTS SPEECH RECOGNITION The U.S. Army CERDEC is conducting a market survey to determine if any commercially available off the shelf (COTS) speech recognition technology, which can meet the specific stringent requirements set forth below exists.  The technology in question is bein g considered for application to select Army programs, and must demonstrate the required performance in the harshest tactical environments.  To be considered the candidate technology must meet the following requirements: 1.	The candidate technology must be capable of recognizing natural speech, where natural speech is defined as:  The ability to recognize co-articulated (no pauses between words) speech phrases, containing up to 8 words (5 words on average) per phrase, with  a phrase recognition rate of 95% (a phrase is considered in error if there is an error in any part of the phrase) for a minimum of 100 phrases.  However, the phrase recognition rate must be unaffected if arbitrary pauses of indefinite length are inserted between words. 2.	The candidate technology must be speaker independent:  Where speaker independence is defined as the ability of the speech recognizer to achieve the required phrase recognition rate (as set forth in 1. above) for 98% of a statistically significant portio n of the user population.  The user population shall be defined as: that population that reflects the same statistical diversity in ethnic and regional accents as represented in today's Army. 3.	The candidate technology must be capable of maintaining the required phrase recognition performance (as set forth in 1. above) for the entire user population (as set forth in 2. above) during the following noise environments:  a.	Impulsive noise produced by typical user weapons fire (M-16), which can achieve peak levels of 150 dB. b.	Continuous noise produced by various track vehicles (M113, M1A1, Bradley and Stryker), under all operating conditions, which will cause a variation in intensity from 100-120 dB, and shifts in spectral content. All potential offerors must provide documented evidence of actual tests that confirm that a candidate technology can meet the requirements set forth above.  The CERDEC reserves the right to determine the acceptability of the documented evidence provided by  a given offeror, based on how closely the documented evidence reflects the requirements above in the judgment of the CERDEC.

There are a couple of items we are currently aware of that effect access:

1.  Internet Access:  If you have dial-up service, your ability to open the pages and view the images is EXTREMELY limited.  The recommendation is to access through plan centers or your local library that has service such as DSL, Cable modem, or satelite.

2.  Internet Explorer is required to access the plans and view the sheets.

3.  Currently printing is limited to page by page.  We have heard from the software developer that the next release will allow for identifying multiple sheets for printing.

At the top of the page is a button for accomplishing a survey to provide us with feedback on the site and the type of methods you use to access the internet, and also for you to comment on the process.

We will be reviewing all feedback we receive in an effort to make access as open as possible.

You will be prompted to load the driver for the reader.  Right click on the image to access measuring tools, zoom features, and other items.

The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Pipefitter Workers be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.    Any delay to a shipyard availability due to inferior pipefitting services would be costly to the Government and is a primary consideration in the award and continuation of any resulting award.    The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – All Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers provided must possess a basic knowledge of most phases of the trade including theory, hydraulics systems, practice, codes, and the proper and safe use of tools and equipments.

Pipefitter Workers and Lead Pipefitter shall be expected to continually improve knowledge and skill to keep pace with technological developments.

Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications, including brazing certificate requirement, of the Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum two (2), and up to eight (8) qualified Marine Pipefitter Workers and a Lead Marine Pipefitter within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.    Price Proposal: Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  CLIN 0001 – PIPEFITTER WORKER and CLIN 0002 - LEAD PIPEFITTER.    These rates shall include all costs to perform the required services.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours (1,200 hrs/Pipefitter Workers, 180 hours Lead Pipefitter) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Pipefitter Workers is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Pipefitter.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.    All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.   On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Pipefitter Workers are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Pipefitter Workers and 30 for the Lead Pipefitter.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

<DESC>Architect/Engineering Services for Mine Site Remediation, including Hazardous Waste Identification and Removal Actions. Work includes Preliminary Assessments, Site Inspections, Engineering Evaluations/Cost Analyses, Removal Actions, Liability Searches (Potentially Responsible Parties) and related work for mines on Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington.  Work is to be done in conformance with all State and Federal Regulations and guidelines and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) “Guidance for Performing Site Inspections Under CERCLA,” EPA “Sampling QA/QC Plan and Data Validation Procedures,” Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), National Contingency Plan (NCP) as outlined in 40 CFR, Parts 300.410, Removal Site Evaluation, (c (i-iv) and 300.415 Removal Action, (2) (I-viii) Other Guidelines, such as NOAA, Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL), EPA Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs).  The more stringent regulations will be used per EO 12580. 

Engineer and Geologist of record shall be a professional engineer/geologist licensed in the state where the project site(s) are located and with technical expertise in the area of emphasis appropriate for the work.  An engineer with Abandoned Mile Lands (AML) experience and registered within the state the work is being performed is required and must be a key element in the organization, not just a referenced source.  This specialty must have a minimum of 5 years experience with Forest Service or BLM related projects with specific experience in all aspects of the CERCLA process, which include:  Abbreviated Preliminary Assessments (APA), Site Inspections (SI), Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analyses (EE/CA), Removal Designs and Removal Actions (RD/RA) and Monitoring.  EPA experience is not relevant as EPA procedures are different from Forest Service procedures.  Forest Service does not use the EPA HRS system for ranking of mines.


Evaluation criteria include (1) Response to the attached Task Order (technical approach), (2) Experience and qualifications of key personnel, including subcontractors and laboratories.  All key personnel involved with these projects, including team leaders, must have a minimum of 5 years experience with mine type projects associated with Forest Service and BLM, which includes education and work experience in all aspects of this work:  APA, SI, EE/CA, RD/RA and Monitoring.  For example, performing water monitoring activities for a chemical plant is not the same as performing water monitoring for abandoned mines.  All experience must be specifically associated with mines, whether active or inactive.  EPA experience is not relevant and therefore will not be rated as highly as Forest Service or BLM experience.  Furthermore, all key personnel and team leaders must have related educational experience for the work being conducted, regardless of title within the organization.  All key disciplines must be licensed in the appropriate state where such licensing is required. Offerors must provide a minimum of 5 project examples specific to mines and mine reclamation for all key personnel and team leaders.  Work experience with coal mines or EPA will not be considered relevant experience.  Must have at least one key person who has educational as well as field experience in active/inactive mine exploration, processing and assessment.  (3) Geographic location, as it relates to ability to reach mine sites in a timely manner and familiarity with local types of mines, and (4) Record of Past Performance.  To respond to the Task Order, include a technical proposal and a separate price proposal, clearly marked.  Seal the price proposal, which will not be used in evaluations.  Upon award of the contract(s), the firm offering the best proposal for the task order, will be selected for negotiations of the task order.  After award, all unopened price proposals will be returned to the offerors.  

Project locations are on or near National Forests in both eastern and western Washington and Oregon states.  More than one award will be made from this solicitation, which will result in a three year requirements contract.  Contractors awarded contracts under this solicitation are not guaranteed award of any task orders; they are instead guaranteed an opportunity to compete for projects, as described in this solicitation:  Forest Service mine reclamation work in Region 6 (Washington and Oregon) to be contracted out will be competed as task orders among holders of this contract.  Competition among contract holders will follow standard A&E procedures.

Submit SF 254 and SF 255 and response to the evaluation criteria (task order - Ehibit One) to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 10600 NE 51st Circle, Vancouver, Washington 98682; attn:  Yvonne J Sterud.  Electronic offers are acceptable but must be in PDF format and cannot exceed 5 megabytes; one hard copy with original signatures is also required.  Offers not submitted electronically must include 4 cd copies of the offer.  Deadline for receipt of all proposals (both electronic and hard copy) is close of business, local time, 17 May 2004.

1) The solicitation indicates that the contractor should initially meet with the US Embassy. Is it therefore correct that the proposal should provide for travel to Mexico City prior to travel to Tijuana and to Nogales?
 
ANSWER: TRAVEL TO MEXICO CITY IS NOT NECESSARY.  MEETINGS WITH THE US EMBASSY VIA PHONE AND E-MAIL SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.
 
2) Should travel plans assume that interested parties to be visited with respect to the Tijuana Intermodal Terminal will be located in Tijuana and Mexico City only?
 
ANSWER:  ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE TIJUANA INTERMODAL TERMINAL SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY PERFORMED IN TIJUANA - ADDITIONAL TRIPS TO MEXICO CITY ARE NOT DEEMED NECESSARY, HOWEVER MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL.
 
3) The solicitation does not identify the location of the Sinaloa investor group interested in the Nogales project and with which the contractor must interface. Will travel to Mexico City and Nogales accomplish the required coordination or should the budget provide for travel to Culiacan and/or Mazatlan in Sinaloa State?
 
ANSWER:  THE CONTRACTOR MUST REMAIN OPEN TO POTENTIAL TRAVEL WITHIN SONORA GIVEN THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATURE OF THIS COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT.  UPON AWARD, THE CONTRACTOR WILL CONTACT THE APPROPRIATE PARTIES AND PLAN TRAVEL ACCORDINGLY. 

4) How many field days in Mexico are required for this project?

ANSWER:  MINIMUM OF 14.

5)  2. What cities will the DM team be required to travel to? Will the site visits be focused just on the project cities of Tijuana and Nogales or will 
the DM team be required to meet with Mexican Federal Government officials in Mexico City? 

ANSWER:  TRAVEL TO MEXICO CITY IS NOT DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE DM.  THE DM TEAM WILL NEED TO TRAVEL TO SEVERAL SITES IN AND AROUND TIJUANA AS WELL AS IN THE STATE OF SONORA.  AS THE SONORA/NOGALES PROJECT PROFILE IS LESS DEVELOPED, THE CONTRACTOR MUST REMAIN OPEN TO TRAVEL IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SONORA.  CORRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO CITY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA PHONE AND E-MAIL.
