<p>Rating Description</p>

<p><br />Unacceptable <br />Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirement of the solicitation.</p>

<p>1. Meet Package Service Delivery Requirements<br />2. Provide Package Service Delivery in a timely manner as detailed in the PWS.</p>

The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government.<br /><br />(b) If pursuant to initial evaluation, the Government rates the Technical factor as "Unacceptable" or if the Government determines that there is some other deficiency or uncertainty relative to an offeror's proposal, and in the Government's judgment, the deficiency is rectifiable or the uncertainty is resolvable; the Contracting Officer (CO) may open discussions and may continue discussions as long as, in the Government's judgment, the deficiency is rectifiable or the uncertainty is resolvable.</p>

<DESC>Urban Land and Service Area Growth Planning Due Diligence Services in Mongolia<br />This is T&amp;M contract<br />MCC is currently developing a second compact with Mongolia. The constraint to economic growth to be addressed by the compact is limited and costly access to water and sanitation in productive sectors and poor communities. To address this constraint, MCC has already narrowed its investment focus to bulk water supply infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar (UB), the capital, accompanied by selected policy and institutional reform and strengthening components within USUG, UB's water utility. The compact development process has also identified the continued rapid spatial expansion of the ger areas as a limitation on the ability of the city to more effectively supply water in the future. This SOW describes work to complete due diligence and provide due diligence design recommendations related to roles MCC funding could play to strengthen the ability of key institutions to address urban expansion and plan for future ger area water service needs, as a way to enhance long-term impact of MCC's bulk water infrastructure investment.
<p>The services under this scope will help to better understand the problems related to urban planning, urban land policy, and urban expansion that are at the root of the ger dimensions of the water constraint, and will recommend concrete policy and institutional investments that MCC could make to address the ger dimension of the water constraint. The focus on urban expansion means that services under this SOW will generally be focused on the fringe portion of the ger areas, at the city's periphery. However, the exact scope of an eventual MCC investment will be determined as a product of the services under this SOW. Bidders should be aware that MCC is not planning to include a major land administration project in the second compact, nor does MCC expect to be making water or sanitation infrastructure investments in ger areas. <br />The services required under this contract will provide due diligence recommendations for the design of policy and institutional interventions appropriate for MCC funding and that can materially address the challenge of urban expansion, urban expansion management, and associated water service planning, and can be achieved within the 5 year lifespan of the compact investment.</p>
<p>The due diligence and due diligence design recommendations work during the Base Period will be divided into three task areas:</p>
<p>1) Foundational due diligence and analysis necessary in addition to existing information,, <br />2) Identification of any relevant comparators for UB with useful design recommendations and solutions, and <br />3) Design recommendations for MCC investment.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that some work associated with the three tasks will proceed in parallel.</p>
