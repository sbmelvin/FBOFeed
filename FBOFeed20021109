This solicitation is a Firm-Fixed Price, Commercial Items, Single Award Contract to a responsible quoter for Fitness club or Health Club services for the Federal Detention Center (FDC) Honolulu, Hawaii for a period not to exceed 12 months.  The Federal Detention Center, Honolulu, Hawaii is requesting offers to provide a firm fixed price for fitness center membership for the employees at FDC Honolulu, HI.  Award will not be made solely on lowest price but by overall best value offered to the Government nor at this time is there a guarantee of award.  General Information:  FDC Honolulu has approximately 256 employees.  Historical data indicates that on average 100 employees will visit the fitness center per month for roughly 660 visits per month.  The membership will be in the name of the institution not the individual employees and a one time membership fee for usage will be paid within 30 days of award.  The membership will cover complete usage of the fitness center (except babysitting or any additional services that are not passed on to other memberships) and will be offered to all employees regardless of usage.  The effective date of the contract is expected to be December 1, 2002.  The government is requesting two different quotes.  Quote #1 will be for a 9 month period and Quote #2 will be for a 12 month period from October to September of each year.  The Government reserves the right to choose the best overall proposal.  Interested parties may submit additional proposals or options.  Eligibility:  All full time employees will be eligible to participate in this program.

The fitness center will also be required to provide updates throughout the term of the contract upon our request.  The institution will supply you with monthly updates of employees who have left the institution for the purpose of canceling their membership privileges.  It will be the institution's responsibility to communicate to all employees that their membership privileges will end once their employment has ended.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is requesting offers under RFQ-60305-0002-3 for Health Club Services.  This solicitation is a Firm-Fixed Price, Commercial Items, Single Award Contract to a responsible quoter for Fitness club or Health Club services for the Federal Detention Center (FDC) Honolulu, Hawaii for a period not to exceed 12 months.  The Federal Detention Center, Honolulu, Hawaii is requesting offers to provide a firm fixed price for fitness center membership for the employees at FDC Honolulu, HI.  Award will not be made solely on lowest price but by overall best value offered to the Government nor at this time is there a guarantee of award.  General Information:  FDC Honolulu has approximately 256 employees.  Historical data indicates that on average 100 employees will visit the fitness center per month for roughly 660 visits per month.  The membership will be in the name of the institution not the individual employees and a one time membership fee for usage will be paid within 30 days of award.  The membership will cover complete usage of the fitness center (except babysitting or any additional services that are not passed on to other memberships) and will be offered to all employees regardless of usage.  The effective date of the contract is expected to be December 1, 2002.  The government is requesting two different quotes.  Quote #1 will be for a 9 month period and Quote #2 will be for a 12 month period from October to September of each year.  The Government reserves the right to choose the best overall proposal.  Interested parties may submit additional proposals or options.  Eligibility:  All full time employees will be eligible to participate in this program.  Once the open enrollment has ended, the fitness center will need to provide the Contract Specialist a roster of plan participants.  The fitness center will also be required to provide updates throughout the term of the contract upon our request.  The institution will supply you with monthly updates of employees who have left the institution for the purpose of canceling their membership privileges.  It will be the institution's responsibility to communicate to all employees that their membership privileges will end once their employment has ended.  The contracting Officer assigned cognizance of this procurement is the undersigned.  Your attention is directed to the fact that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit or obligated the Government to an expenditure of pulblic funds, should a contract result from this RFQ.  In accordance with FAR 52.232-18 AVAILABILTY OF FUNDS (APR 1984), Funds are not presently available for this contract.  The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.  Please place any questions you may have in writing and fax them to (808)838-4508 to the attention of Antoinette Kennedy or call (808)838-4200 ext 2302.  We will consider all questions received and provide responses, where appropriate.  All communication prior to award will be directed to the Contracting Officer.  All offers must be received by the Contracting Officer specified above No Later Than 3:30pm EST, on November 20, 2002.
