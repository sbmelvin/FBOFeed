<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized pursuant to the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288), as amended by the Robert T.

The Disaster Housing (DH) Program (directly administered by FEMA), and the Individual and Family Grant (IFG) Program (administered by the State with partial funding from FEMA), provide grant assistance to disaster applicants in accordance with the Act.  In order to accomplish this mission, FEMA contracts out for the management and performance of individual housing inspection services.

Contract award will be based on best-value to the Government where technical merit is more important than cost/price.  The estimated award date is June 1, 2006.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the Fedbizopps (FBO) web pages at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.
