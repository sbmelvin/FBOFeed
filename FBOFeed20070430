The effort should focus on design trades followed by screening of a variety of concepts to meet the system level goals set forth.  The offeror is encouraged to leverage current and relevant prior studies in making host configuration selections and to emphasize technical substantiation of the inlet system and integration issues.
Some key attributes of the host configuration include effective STOL performance, speed agility, all-aspect survivability considerations (including, but not limited to overall system redundancy, damage tolerance, etc.), and overall layout compatible with intense, high-tempo utilization in austere areas (by operators, maintainers and passengers) without sheltered storage.  Sustained operations in extreme hot and cold (-65 to 125 degrees F)  ground level temperature in all types of precipitation are anticipated.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for IAMANET.  The objective of the IAMANET program is to develop an intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network. An intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network will directly support integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, safety, and non-repudiation of MANET communications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited. Finally (although not exhaustively) existing protocols are not robust to byzantine failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure. The broad objectives of the IAMANET program are to address these Internet-paradigm problems and related challenges such as: increasing the probability that bad behavior will be detected; increasing work factor and uncertainty for an adversary; and explicitly identifying a minimal set of critical components that must be deeply evaluated and protected from lifecycle attacks. 

DARPA BAA 07-32 will solicit only Phase 1 of the IAMANET program.  Phase 1 is Research, design, prototyping, and demonstration of network infrastructure and applications.  This task will concern primarily the applications, the intrinsically assurable network infrastructure, and any necessary Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  Key security responses of the assurable network infrastructure are expected to involve authenticating and accounting for the use of all network resources, denying all but authorized traffic, and tolerating byzantine (other-than-fail-stop) failures from one or more network nodes and applications. Dynamic reconfiguration, re-provisioning, and reconstitution may also be responses of the network infrastructure. 

DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 07-32) on or before 4:00 p.m. (local Arlington VA time), June 27, 2007.  (NOTE: University (team led) grant submissions may be made via the Grants.gov web site, http://grants.gov by using the "apply for Grants" functions.  Dual submissions are not required.)

ELIGIBLE PROPOSERS: The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Sec 217 and PL 105-261 Sec 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offer the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are described in detail in the IAMANET PIP.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. In descending order of importance, the proposal Evaluation Criteria include: (A) technical and architectural approach; (B) assurability of the proposed solution; (C) management approach and qualifications of the key individuals; (D) constructive plan / research agenda realism; (E) potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission; and (F) cost and schedule reasonableness and realism. In accordance with FAR 35.016(e) the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  Cost and schedule reasonableness and realism shall also be considered to the extent appropriate as described in the PIP. Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed. 

SECURITY:   Although Phase 1 of this program is currently planned to be unclassified, aspects of subsequent phases will be classified. Proposers to Phase 1 must intend to participate in subsequent phases, and will be expected to outline the means whereby they will be able to continue work in subsequent phases. Proposals not addressing this requirement will be considered noncompliant.  This means, at a minimum, that the prime contractor/grantee in Phase 2 and beyond must be a U.S. based institution holding a current facility clearance. Phase 1 proposers will be expected to describe the management plan and a division of labor that will permit the team to propose to subsequent program phases. The prime contractor or grantee will be expected to comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Laws, and other governing statutes that may become applicable.  See Paragraph 3.8 of the IAMANET  PIP for related information.

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the IAMANET PIP.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must obtain the IAMANET PIP.  You can access these documents at www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov.  This BAA and PIP together constitute the full BAA for this project.

<DESC>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.  On January 1, 1981, The NHTSA issued Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, Child Restraint Systems.  FMVSS No. 213 specifies various performance tests which include material test and dynamic test.  FMVSS No. 213 sets forth the performance requirements for many types of child restraint systems.  It includes the testing provisions which are necessary to determine whether a restraint system meets those performance requirements.  The test provisions include material tests which are intended to verify webbing, hardware and other components of a child restraint system comply with the requirements of those components. 

Specific Requirements:  NHTSA intends to procure testing services and reports so that the Government can determine whether child restraint system components comply with the requirements of FMVSS No. 213. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary qualified technical personnel, facilities, and equipment to perform testing services necessary to determine conformance of child restraint components, provided to the contractor as Government Furnished Test Items (GTFI), with the applicable requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems. Either whole child restraints or individual components will be provided. 

Contract Award:   NHTSA intends to award a single, Time and Materials contract with a base year to include optional quantities during year one (1) of the contract.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Solicitation for Construction Manager (CM) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2135, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO27140.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about May 15, 2007.  Time for completion:  365 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  The geographic area is the City of St. Louis, the State of Missouri east of Columbia and the State of Iowa east of and including the metropolitan area of Des Moines.  Project involves:  for building construction projects having a construction cost less than $35,000,000.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, develop management plan, schedule, budget, studies); (2) Design Phase Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting red-lined as-built drawings to CAD drawings); and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,800,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded in the initial period (1-year) will be $5,000 per firm/joint venture and a minimum of $5,000 per firm/joint venture for each of the exercised option periods.  The maximum amount payable shall not exceed $2,800,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractors performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year periods.  The successful CM contractor(s), including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A/E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the best value concept in selecting a CM.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a May 15, 2007.  Proposals shall be received in this office on or about June 14, 2007.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and (3) Management Plan.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220.

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions.  

The use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy with each offer.  Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Once there you will find detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance under Help. To prepare for and register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) as identified in the CCR record.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The office of Pacific marine environmental laboratory, located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire the following items:  Six (6) each Paroscientific Inc. brand Model Met 1-2 Intelligent Barometer, P/N 1488-002, pressure range 800-1100 HPA in environmental enclosure with gill pressure port and RS-232 interface via VSG-4-BCL connector. NOAA Science Camp from July 2007 through September 2007.   The Paroscientific Met 1-2 Intelligent Barometer measures atmospheric pressure on remotely moored ATLAS buoys.  These buoys are part of a large international effort to monitor ocean conditions along the equatorial Pacific and have been an ongoing effort since 1982.  Paroscientific is the only brand that possesses the accuracy and resolution proven on large scale deep ocean tests.  These sensors can be used in the equatorial region where the atmospheric pressure signal is small, thus requiring a higher accuracy and greater resolution than in other regions in the world such as the Gulf of Alaska.  Existing equipment is designed to interface with the Paroscientific?s output and is compatible with the PMEL logging instrumentation.  Changing to any other vendor would require redesign of input circuitry, changing instrumentation software, and scheduling testing, which would result in additional time and expense to the Government.  Delivery required no later than August 6, 2007.  The intended acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.   This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to Paroscientific Inc. Only firms that can provide the exact items described herein will be considered. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 526-6025 attention to Mona Ash.   ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely and issue a Purchase Order to I/S Management Strategies, Ltd. of Whitefish Bay, WI to study the economic feasibility of changing some software licensing structures to workload license charges (WLC), or sub-capacity pricing, where it is in the best interest of the Government.  SSA currently operates six IBM z990 zSeries mainframes at the National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD including zAAP processors. The Agency runs mainframe software products from hundreds of vendors on 26 LPARS.  IBM developed the Sub-capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT), a software product that records the 4-rolling average usage of some (not all) software, and determines where the software executes. The output of this tool determines how IBM, and other vendors, invoice customers for WLC or sub-capacity pricing. IBM offers this tool as a free download to its customers, and the services described in this synopsis require the use of SCRT. However, SCRT by itself cannot meet SSA's requirements to perform a cost benefit analysis (CBA) of changes to license structures, fails to adequately address current and projected growth estimates, does not allow for independent audits, and lacks the detailed reporting features that some financial decision require. SSA requires services that exceed the capabilities of the SCRT tool. SSA requires services that assist in planning for, implementing, monitoring and leveraging WLC, or that document why changing prices structures is not in the best interest of the Agency.  Other organizations that believe they are capable of meeting SSA?s requirements are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience and other pertinent data.  Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Verbal responses are NOT acceptable and will not be considered. All responses to this notice must be submitted by May 10, 2007.  Responses may be sent via E-MAIL ONLY to the point of contact listed below. NO PHONE CALLS OR FAXES.

<SUBJECT>66--Establish Basic Ordering Agreements for Neutron Guides
<SOLNBR>SB1341-07-RP-0014
<RESPDATE>063007

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research, has a requirement to establish multiple Basic Ordering Agreements for the manufacture of neutron guides on an as needed basis.

The NIST/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a large laboratory facility consisting of a suite of instruments that measure the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties.  The NCNR maintains a wide variety of instruments that allow great flexibility in the type of samples and phenomena that can be studied and measured.  

The majority of these instruments use neutrons with energies at the low end of the energy spectrum called cold neutrons.  These cold neutrons must be delivered from the neutron source to the instruments and neutron guides are used for this purpose.  In much the same manner as a fiber optic cable carries light rays, the neutron guides channel the neutrons away from the source and carry them to a location where they are used to probe matter in one of the many neutron-scattering spectrometers at the NCNR.  The interior of the guides is coated with a neutron-reflective material to maximize the transmission of neutrons by allowing those making contact with the interior surfaces at incident angles below a characteristic angle to be reflected and continue downstream toward the desired destination.  The characteristic angle and reflection efficiency are functions of the reflective surface and coating properties and the energy of the incident neutron.  In order to remain a state-of-the-art neutron scattering facility, the NCNR continues to evolve by adding new instrumentation and upgrading existing instrumentation.  

This requirement will create Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) for purchasing completed neutron guides, custom-made to satisfy the parameters and specifications provided by the NCNR Engineering staff. 

The Government intends to award multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to maximize NCNR use of the world?s limited guide-making capacity and to take advantage of price competition.   

The neutron guides, which are classified as commercial items, shall be procured using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  Full and open competition shall be utilized.  

The period of performance shall be for a period of five (5) years from the date of award.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-07-RP-0014.

THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT MAY 13, 2007, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.  

POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.  

Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  

THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMAITON (RFI) ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid, merely a request for information only.  The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry regarding a modification to an existing fiberglass cover on an existing L3 Communications Brashear KINETO Tracking Mount (KTM) Weibel radar system.  Because of the size of the radar the original fiberglass cover will not fit over the KTM/radar.  The radar protrudes out from the fiberglass cover about a foot on each side.  The height of the KTM/radar to where it meets the base of the cover is 72.5? and the fiberglass cover is 79? tall.  There should be ample height on the fiberglass cover to accommodate the radar.  The radar with the bracket is about a foot wide where it protrudes from the cover.  Total estimated surface area on one side that needs extending is 3 square feet (6 square feet for both sides).  The fiberglass cover is about 20 years old (refurbished about one year ago) and has a double wall of fiberglass over unknown honeycomb core.  The thickness of the wall is 1 inch to give the cover straight and provide rigidity.  The fiberglass cover comes in two halves and is manually pulled up on the KTM/radar trailer to provide for a weather resistance cover (commonly referred to as clamshells).  Where the clamshells meet, the walls are shaped into a mounted fiberglass flange that houses the weather resistance gasket.  The locking position for the radar on the KTM to secure it for transportation is along the axis where the two halves of the clamshells meet.  It is most likely that both halves of the clamshells will have to be modified and the weather resistance flange/gasket will be extended around the modification.  Some hardware will have to be relocated to accommodate the extension.   Photo will be provided on request to the POC.   Responses shall be limited to 15 pages and should include, as a minimum evidence of past experience, related projects and/or existing projects, etc, and business size.  Interested parties need to identify if t hey fall into one of the following categories:  large business, small business, hubzone small business, veteran owned small business, woman owned small business, or small disadvantaged business.  All respondents that can provide any of the requested information should reply to Mike Sikorski at the following email address: Michael.sikorski@edwards.af.mil or by mail to 412 TW/ENRE, 306 E Popson Avenue, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

<DESC>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.  On January 1, 1981, The NHTSA issued Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, Child Restraint Systems.  FMVSS No. 213 specifies various performance tests which include material test and dynamic test.  FMVSS No. 213 sets forth the performance requirements for many types of child restraint systems.  It includes the testing provisions which are necessary to determine whether a restraint system meets those performance requirements.  The test provisions include material tests which are intended to verify webbing, hardware and other components of a child restraint system comply with the requirements of those components. 

Specific Requirements:  NHTSA intends to procure testing services and reports so that the Government can determine whether child restraint system components comply with the requirements of FMVSS No. 213. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary qualified technical personnel, facilities, and equipment to perform testing services necessary to determine conformance of child restraint components, provided to the contractor as Government Furnished Test Items (GTFI), with the applicable requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems. Either whole child restraints or individual components will be provided. 

Contract Award:   NHTSA intends to award multiple Firm Fixed Price contracts with a base year to include optional quantities during year one (1) of the contract.  The contract will also include a provision by which two 24-month option periods can be exercised (in two-year increments) resulting in a total possible performance period of five (5) years. 

This solicitation is full and open competition. 

Solicitation:  The solicitation DTNH22-07-R-00011 will be available for downloading from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about February 26, 2007.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information  received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Specifications, plans, or drawings related to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Attached please find the draft Program Management Plan (PMP) for the Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT).  This documents the agreement between Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) and the OSD Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) office for the execution of the STAT program.  Italicized sections of the PMP detail the required format of the document and the CTEIP expectations for each paragraph and section.  These are left in for ease of review.  In some sections, the STAT program team discussed items, but did not devise a final solution.  Our discussions topics are provided to help clarify the direction we?re investigating.  Comments or additional information/experiences (i.e. what worked, what didn?t, what risks are involved with various alternatives) are appreciated.

Some sections in this document refer to the STAT acquisition strategy.  Please note that this is a DRAFT document and more program assessments and reviews will be required before that strategy is finalized and approved  Once approved, the final strategy will be presented in a draft Request For Proposal (RFP).

Please read and be prepared to discuss the PMP at the 15-16 May Industry Days at Arnold AFB, TN.  A draft agenda was sent earlier.  If you do not wish to attend Industry Days, or if you prefer to make your inputs to government personnel only, rather than in an open forum, please provide your comments directly to Lt Col Kim Nelson at kim.nelson@arnold.af.mil and to Ms. Kathy Swanson at Kathy.swanson@arnold.af.mil.

<DESC>See the original posting for the description and notes since they continue to apply (subject to the additional notes and clarifications below).  Note the following: The solicitation number (<SOLNBR>) is FA8217-07-R-64402 even though the original posting identified it as FD2020-06-6-4402.  The incorrect number was used (above) only so that this amendment (to the original posting) could be easily traced to the original posting. The "99--Wideband Kit for Alpena" identified as the original posting's "<Subject>," and the "Wideband Kit" identified in the original posting's description, are hereby more specifically identified as "Wideband Threat Emitter Kit." The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one contractor (as explained in the original posting) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Note:  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not own the appropriate rights to some of the technical data that is needed to meet this requirement. The solicitation document will contain information that has been designated as "Military Critical Technical Data." Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may have a copy of the solicitation document (once the solicitation is released). All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800)-352-3572. The DLIS United/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil.ccal/. Based upon market research, the Government will not be using policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described items. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the company that the original posting listed as the sole source contractor. Reminder: The Government intends on using Integrated Product Team (IPT) Pricing, with the sole source contractor, from the time of solicitation issuance.  Therefore, the solicitation that gets posted (electronically) will not be complete, but will only be adequate for immediately beginning IPT pricing with the sole source contractor.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to negotiate with the National Institute of Public Health in Norway to collect, process, store, and manage specimens, and to develop tools to enhance use of the specimen samples and collaboration in conjunction with the Norway Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).  In the MoBa study, approximately 100,000 pregnant women will be enrolled during the 17th week of pregnancy; these women and their offspring will be followed until the offspring are adults.  Blood and urine are collected from the women, who also complete a series of questionnaires about themselves and their offspring.  

The goals of the study are manifold, but the study primarily will serve as a flexible platform from which a wide variety of studies can be done using the samples and associated data.  Increasing the number of subjects with environmental specimens will: (1) increase the statistical power in studies of more frequent outcomes to detect gene-environment interactions; (2) give adequate statistical power to study environmental determinants of rare diseases such as autism, cerebral palsy, hypospadias, and schizophrenia; and (3) increase the ability to conduct a large number of studies, especially for more frequent outcomes.
 
The MoBa study was initiated by and run by the National Institute of Health in Norway.  Specimen collection began in 1999.  In 2002, NIEHS scientists began having additional specimen material collected from the pregnant women to enhance the ability to evaluate associations between environmental exposures during pregnancy and subsequent health outcomes in the offspring.  NIEHS is currently supporting further specimen collection in conjunction with the MoBa study.  No other source has access to the MoBa cohort or the related specimens and data, and no other source has a large enough study in which both blood and urine specimens were collected to effectively meet NIEHS’ needs.  The National Institute of Health in Norway is the only source capable of performing NIEHS’ requirement. 

Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306.302-1.  See Numbered Note 22.

The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the response date of this RFP No. NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2007-12 to Monday, May 14, 2007. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) under the National Institute of Health intends to solicit proposals with the requisite capabilities to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior.  The current contractor for this project is the CDM Group, Inc.  This requirement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of NICHD, conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior. One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents. Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th to 10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and options for a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students. The U.S. cross-sectional survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The international HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries. Imbedded in the U.S. national sample is a cross-sectional sample for the international HBSC survey which requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students. The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to make this information available so as to enable improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions. Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries. U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries. U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar. Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care. The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.

Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.

<CONTACT>Jacquelyn D. Harris Contracting Officer 2022082839     jharris@osmre.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Office of Surface Mining (OSM), Division of Reclamation Support located in Washington, DC is seeking capability statements from qualified 8A, HUBZone and/or Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOB) to provide Information Technology support services.  The scope of IT support services needed shall cover the period of performance from the project development through the project deployment phase.  Support services may also include maintenance, not to exceed five years.  OSM is tasked with the responsibility, in cooperation with the States and Indian Tribes, to protect citizens and the environment during coal mining and reclamation, and to reclaim mines abandoned before 1977 under the authority of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).  The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Program implements SCMRA by providing a safer cleaner environment by reclaiming and restoring as much land and water as possible that was degraded by pre 1977 coalmining operations. The AML program is carried out through cooperative partnerships between OSM and participating States and Indian tribes - 26 States and three Indian Tribes (see SMCRA, P.L. 95-87, 30 U.S.C.  1231 & 30 U.S.C. 1333).  As a component of the AML Program, the Abandoned Mine Land Inventory System (AMLIS) is a data repository that implements section 403(1) and (2) of SMCRA.  SMCRA specifies that Secretary of the Department of Interior maintain an inventory of eligible Abandoned Mine Lands and waters, which meet specific public health, safety, and general welfare criteria.  As such, AMLIS is a mission critical program which provides the following information:  A source of information on the extent of work completed under each State/Tribal program and cost of AML problems remaining to be abated.  This information is documented in report form and is presented to DOI and Congress annually.  Congress uses this data in support of the annual AML appropriations.  OSM uses AMLIS to determine which States and Tribes have sufficient priority coal problems to justify a grant distribution from the Federal Historic Coal Share SMCRA 402 (g) (5)).  A variety of reports are generated from AMLIS on a regular basis that serve specific needs for other offices within OSM, States, Tribes, Customers, and in depth Congressional requests. The purpose of this project is to support the re-design of the inventory system:  To provide an inventory system based on field surveys by State, Tribal, and OSM program officials; and to comply with DOI Enterprise Architecture Technical Reference Model (TRB), fully support HSPD-12 and e-Authentication requirements, conform to upcoming IPv6 government-wide connectivity demands, and further enhance AMLIS user accessibility and accuracy.   To achieve our objectives, OSM needs to replace the existing system architecture.  The residing system is developed in Paradox database management system and Delphi version release 5.  These systems are based on outdated programming languages that are not widely supported and are becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain.  OSM prefers to use a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution to the extent practical.  OSM anticipates that only minor modification may be required to customize the COTS to meet system requirements. Qualifications and Selection Criteria: OSM is interested in receiving capability statements from 8A, HUBZone, Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, and other small business types interested in this project.  To be eligible for consideration, your firm must have at least three (3) years experience and expertise in the following areas: 1.  Analysis and selection of COTS software solutions, preferably, in a web-enabled database environment; 2.  Implementation of COTS solutions, preferably COTS web-enabled database  software; 3.  Integration of COTS components with legacy systems;  4.  Software development and testing; 5.  Database design, 6.  Data migration and conversion;  7.  Report development  8.  Development of training materials, if needed.  9.  Life cycle costing techniques; 10.  IT Security; 11.  Project Management; and 12.  Performance-Based acquisition experience (preferably Federal experience) to include knowledge and experience writing performance metrics in an IT environment; use of evaluation techniques in the review and selection of COTS products; and experience with the development of quality assurance surveillance plans. 13.  Maintenance and support which shall include updates, licensing and maintenance releases to the COTs software.   14.  Firms submitting capability statements should provide three (3) past performance references covering the same or similar services within the past three years.  The reference information should include company or agency name,  address, contract number; dollar value; length of contract; description of work performed; 	point-of-contact (POC); email address, and phone number for POC.   Capability statements should also provide the resumes of key personnel who will be assigned to the project and describe any relevant IT experience.   OSM intends to conduct interviews with firms meeting the thirteen (13) criteria above.  Interviews may be face-to-face or by teleconference.  Accordingly, failure to address the qualification requirements above or to provide the past performance references, could result in non-selection for the interview and the project.   OSM anticipates setting this acquisition aside.  The type of set aside will depend on the quality of the responses from 8(a), HubZone, and SDVOB.  If no 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOB is determined to be qualified, OSM will consider issuing a competitive small business set-aside.  Therefore, capability statements will be accepted from all small business types.  Companies are encouraged to form teaming arrangements to complement the skills, experience, and expertise needed for this project.  Potential small businesses are invited to a demonstration of the AMLIS system on Tuesday, May 15, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. EST.  Please contact Jacquelyn D. Harris at 202 208-2839 or by email at jharris@osmre.gov if you plan to attend.  Your attendance at the demonstration is optional.  In addition, please submit your capability statements to the Office of Surface Mining, Attention: Jacquelyn D. Harris, Room 354, 1951 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20240 or by email to jharris@osmre.gov.

<DESC>A.	 General Information      The Pacific Region (TRBO Reg 12), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreem ent Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Pre-Filled Syringes (Saline).  The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.      This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agr eement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ i s a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be det ermined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.     Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst, 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Pre-Filled Syringes (Saline). For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $111,961.00. This forecast is based on historical prime vend or sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information , and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network s ecurity, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Re gion. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.   Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  After review of the tec hnical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.   Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship sa mples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.    Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, using a one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The TPRB h as set a 3.75 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable for standardization and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. T he Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods  (not to exceed 5 years).

<DESC>A.	 General Information 	The Pacific Region (TRBO Reg 12), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Suture.  The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB. 	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreeme nt (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil 	The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be de termined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.     Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst, 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required 	The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Suture. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $418,933.00. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-mon th period.  	At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informatio n, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors 	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior  to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   	This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for  resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria 	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this  initiative.   	Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the tec hnical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  	Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment F acilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, using a one to five rating. One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The TPRB h as set a 3.75 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable for standardization and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. T he Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  	Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total  requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. 	Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option period s (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation 	The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1)  the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or service s offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.) 1.

This is a republication of a previous FedBizOpps Notice W91YU003 07OXYPRODS that supersedes that notice and sets a new closing date of May 28, 2007.  Vendors previously responding to FedBizOpps Notice W91YU00307OXYPRODS will be notified of their inclusion in the evaluation and need not resubmit unless resubmission meets  a business need.  The product category includes, but is not limited to, oxygen masks, tubing and nasal cannulae used to administer oxygen to patients. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that r epresents the clinically preferred product or source at the best price possible. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the area include, but are not limited to, Madigan Arm y Medical Center, Naval Hospital Bremerton, Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, Bassett Army Community Hospital, Elmendorf Air Force Base Hospital, Fairchild Air Force Base Clinic, McChord Air Force Base Clinic, Eielson Air Force Base Clinic, Naval Medical Center S an Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB, Tripler Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Guam, Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, 374th MDG Yokota, and 35th MDG Misawa. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAP A) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the P rime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month o ption periods.  Anticipated award date is October 2007.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.     Point of Contact is: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - Patricia.Cordier@us.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Northwest, Southwest, and Pacific Regions (LSA-West) are seeking product line items in the category of Respiratory Therapy/Oxygen Delivery Products used to delivery and provide oxygen to hospital patients.   The estimated total volume in the three Regions for this product line is over $213K annually. At the request of the Northwest, Southwest and Pacific Regions (LSA-West) Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime ve ndor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered  by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address), your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and electronic product l iterature to the following individuals no later than May 28, 2007: Patricia Cordier, RN, MSN:  Patricia.Cordier@amedd.army.mil  Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN:       Cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil Cheryl Janus, RN, MBA:       Cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process for each Region participating in this initiative. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Nor thwest, Southwest and Pacific Regions. They are the decision makers for this initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After review of the technical criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clin ical/performance evaluation.        The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors fa iling to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Clinical factors will be weighted more heavily than price. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing, based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for LSA-West, for analysis. Vendors wh o fail to offer discounted prices could be excluded from RIA award consideration.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years). The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale with a 1-7 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Slightly Disagree; 4 = Undecided; 5 = Slightly Agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly Agree). The CPT has set a t hreshold of 4.1 for acceptability of products for standardization. All clinical criteria are weighted equally.  Clinical/performance results lower than 4.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  The results of the clinical evaluation of the products are the most important factor to the TPRB when making a best value decision.  The TPRB considers pricing a secondary factor.  Technical Criteria Evaluation The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: Technical Company Criteria:         1.  Does your company provide a full range of Oxygen Delivery Products to include face masks, non-rebreathing masks, face tents, cannulae, venturi masks, and tubing?

The OnDemand software is proprietary software owned by Global Knowledge.  Moreover, Global Knowledge is the only company with authority to perform this type of work with the OnDemand software.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for this requirement.  This is the Request for Proposals.  No other solicitation will be issued.  The provisions and clauses incorporated into this document are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.

1.INTRODUCTION:  The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health 
hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation?s mines.  MSHA carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all mining and mineral processing operations in the United States.  

1.1 BACKGROUND:It is expected within the next 3 years MSHA will face the retirement of nearly 59% of the supervisors and managers. The loss of expertise and the loss of the knowledge they possess are a concern for MSHA.  MSHA believes it is necessary to begin proactive steps towards preventing major skill gaps by developing a diverse and well-trained leadership pool composed of employees with leadership potential who have developed proficiency in skills appropriate for higher levels of responsibility. 
	
2.STATEMENT OF WORK:MSHA plans to implement a leadership development program (LDP) that is specifically designed for preparing journeyman level technical personnel in GS-13 level positions.  The purpose of the LDP is to provide the journeyman level personnel competencies for transition into leadership positions within MSHA.   This journeyman level leadership development program will enhance the skills and abilities of personnel with promotion potential to fill vacancies as they occur. The plan includes mentoring, developmental assignments, team building and knowledge management/transfer in addition to classroom training. This LDP will consist of courses on critical leadership competencies such as conflict management, accountability, organizational awareness, decisiveness, service motivation and problem solving.

3.SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

4.CONTRACT TYPE:  Firm Fixed Price

5.PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Base Period of 3 Cohorts and 5 Optional Cohorts, over a period of 2 years.

6.PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  National Mine Health and Safety Academy, 1301 Airport Road, Beaver, WV  25813 

7.The contractor shall design, develop and deliver a Leadership Development Program for the journeymen level personnel preparing to assume leadership/supervisory positions at MSHA.  The contract activities and deliverables to be developed are described in the following line items.  The contractor shall:

7.1.PROGRAM CONTENT 
7.1.1.	Design, develop and deliver a LDP based on the OPM Executive Core Qualifications. (www.opm.gov/ses/ecq.asp)  In particular, emphasis should be placed on Service Motivation (Leading Change), Conflict Management (Leading People), Accountability, Decisiveness and Problem Solving (Results Driven) and Organizational Awareness (Coalition Building and Communication).  All program activities will emphasize the practical application of leadership theory as it pertains to MSHA?s core business.
7.1.2.	The contractor shall develop, design and implement the program in accordance with the following learning methodologies guidelines; Lecture in Workshops, Experiential Activities in Workshops and small groups, Individual or Small Group Coaching, Learning Team Activities, Individual Practices and Reflection. The learning shall be fully integrated for all of the five practices and across all learning methodologies.  In addition to leadership theory the learning shall demonstrate ?real world application?.  The contractor shall respond, in real time during workshops, to the needs of the participants and modify content and methodology to maximize the learning impact for the participants.
7.1.3.	Design a program to support 8 cohorts, with 20-25 students in each cohort.  MSHA anticipates up to 3 Cohorts in 2007 and the remainder in FY 2008 and beyond.
7.1.4.	The first cohort is a pilot and will be filled with 24 existing supervisors.  This group will be asked to provide feedback on the program based on their experience as MSHA supervisors.  This feedback will be used to gauge the applicability of the curriculum to MSHA?s needs.  Necessary changes and adjustment will be made to the program based on this feedback. 
7.1.5.	Provide a 3 week residential program that will be delivered in one week increments over approximately an 8 month period at the MSHA training facility at Beaver, West Virginia. 
7.1.6.	Each cohort shall be comprised of small learning teams; with a maximum of eight participants per team, with an assigned facilitator for each team for each of the 3 one week-long modules. 
7.1.7.	Cohorts will overlap periods at the Academy and could allow for some combined activities.  E.g. Cohort 1?s week two or week three, will be scheduled during Cohort 2?s week one. This will allow for additional team building, networking, and knowledge transfer from one Cohort to the next. Time shall be set aside for these overlapping groups to have time together. MSHA has included a tentative Cohort schedule in Section 8 ?Deliverables?.  MSHA has limited funding at this time and intends to conduct cohorts 1,2 and 3 as a ?base? period of performance with Cohorts 4-10 as optional periods to be conducted subject to the availability of funds.
7.1.8.	Each weekly session shall allow for participants to arrive on Sunday and to depart no later than Friday at 1:00 pm. Sunday late-afternoon/early-evening will be an opening session and Friday will end no later than noon. The design of the one-week sessions should include specific evening activities, however not all evenings should have activities in order  to provide participant free time for networking and to foster team building with other LDP participants. 
7.1.9.	The contractor shall provide and administer individual 360 Degree feedback (360) and Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment tools to the LDP participants.   The 360 degree feedback shall be administered prior to the participant?s first classroom session.  The MBTI shall be administered at the beginning of the participants first classroom session. The contractor shall provide the results of both the 360 and MBTI to the participant during their first classroom session. The contractor shall provide each participant with a minimum of one hour individualized coaching session on their assessment results.  Participants will utilize the results of their assessment(s) in discussion with their mentors and to develop the Individualized Leadership Development Plan (ILDP).    
7.1.10.	The contractor shall provide a ? day mentoring development session for the mentors that MSHA will identify and match to each participant. MSHA will schedule the mentors to receive their 1/2 training and work with their mentees the remaining ? day toward the later part of each participant?s 1st week of training.  (i.e. interact with trainers/facilitators, work with mentee in the development of ILDP, develop a mentor/mentee agreement)  
7.1.11.	The contractor shall develop a list of potential assignments and readings that support or enhance the classroom learnings and/or the participant?s individual needs as identified by the assessment process.   The list shall be a part of the proposal and MSHA will approve the list within 5 days of a contract award.   These assignments shall be completed by the participants during the time between the classroom sessions. Additionally, MSHA will provide a knowledge transfer assignment for each participant.   Participants will include assignments with milestones and completion dates in their ILDP.    The participants? individual assignments will be reviewed and approved by the participant?s mentor and the COTR before being finalized in their ILDP.  The participant?s progress on assignments in the ILDP shall be tracked and recorded.  The participant?s must complete all items in the ILDP before the end of the cohort.  Subsequent changes to the participant?s ILDP must be approved by both the mentor and the COTR.  (see deliverable)    
7.1.12.	The contractor will provide time in the program for MSHA senior leadership to participate at key sessions throughout the training program.  The COTR will coordinate MSHA senior leadership participation.  Involvement may include giving welcoming comments at the beginning of a cohort, making a presentation or having a discussion on leadership (e.g. a topic or challenge) from his or her perspective and will participate in close-out/graduation for each cohort.  We anticipate 3 key sessions for each cohort. 
7.1.13.	The contractor shall provide post program follow-up assessment and analysis to assist MSHA in determining a return on investment from the LDP. ( see  deliverable )
7.1.14.	The contractor shall attend a meeting(s) with MSHA?s senior leadership to present a program overview and progress report during the first performance period at the Mine Academy on a mutually agreed upon date and time.
7.1.15.	The contractor shall develop and provide post module and post cohort participant evaluations to assess course quality and effectiveness.  The evaluations will cover applicability of the learning to real world situations, course content and course delivery.  The evaluations along with an analysis will be provided to the COTR within 5 days of each module?s and cohort?s completion for review and discussion with the contractor.   Based on evaluations, course structure and content may be adjusted or changed to meet MSHA?s needs and expectations. (see deliverable)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

2.0. REQUIREMENTS 

2.1.  BASIC SPECIFICATION OF SYSTEM: The T-1 shelters presently located on east ramp at hangars 5,6 and 7 with the physical locations being rows 8 through 12 are to rolled as single units and reattached to existing piers at the south end of the east ramp hangars 15 and 16; rows 16 through 20.  Due to high replacement value of these shelters the contractor will have to provide the necessary bond coverage for damage/replacement. In addition to the bonding requirement each shelter move will be regarded as an independent contract; follow on awards will be based on review of structure integrity, placement accuracy and customer satisfaction.       

2.2.	DESIGN SPECIFICATION: The existing T-1 shelter located at rows 8 through 12 are to be relocated one row at a time by lifting/securing and placing mobile chassis under the shelter structures and moving them their predetermined new location rows 16 through 20.  The shelters will be moved intact with all lights and subcomponents within or on the shelter; note items such as electrical circuit panels, grounding connections, T-1 CASS systems and CASS (4 inch thick) ground slabs will be disconnected and reinstalled by the base IDIQ electrical contractor.  The moving contractor will be required to provide drawings of the moving chassis and single point tow bridle (which attaches to the tow vehicle and structure/chassis) to CE for review prior to the move.  There will be no welding, flame cutting or fabrication of components on site.  In the event there is an emergency need for welding a bracket the necessary licenses will need to be approved and obtained from the Base Fire Marshal and Air Field Manager before any action can be taken.    The moving contractor will be required to lift the 325 ft long by 55 ft wide structure in one simultaneous slow lift with minimal deflection to the structure and roof.  Once the structure is secured and ready to move the old ground attachment point are to be ground smooth to the ramp (below the service).  The contractor will be required to provide adequate weight bearing cover matting to cross the DV Red Carpet area in the event the shelters should have to travel over it.  As the structure moves down the ramp the contractor will have the necessary personnel and tie down equipment to secure the shelter to the ramp in the event a situation should arise.  The structure is to be moved in such a manner that the tow speed should be slow enough to prevent any twisting, waiving, or material deflection of the structure.   Upon the arrival of the shelter at its location the contractor will be responsible for aligning the shelter with the existing pier locations and the alignment with the T-38 shelters at the north end of the east ramp, and reattach it to the ramp. The contractor is required to use the same grade anchor bolts as original manufacturing materials in securing the shelters attachment points.  After the shelter is secured in place truss, vertical stanchions, horizontal and knee bracing will be randomly re-torque to original manufactures specifications.  During the moving process the contractor shall temporally anchor the shelter to the existing concrete ramp if the shelter could be damaged from unexpected wind conditions.  During the moving process and after anchored to the final pier locations the entire structure (including, but not limited to bolts, fasteners, and screws) must withstand wind gust of 120+ mph.   The contractor will also be responsible for any and all touch up paint associated with the move.                                                                          


	
2.4.  HAZARDOUS AND/OR TOXIC MATERIALS:  Any Hazardous Materials shall be used in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.223-3 and AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.  Any and all hazardous/toxic materials brought to the job site shall require manufacturer-specific Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) (FAR 52.223-03, the clause entitled Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data).  A listing of hazardous materials is provided in FED-STD-313A, Appendix B, paragraph S20.3.1. This is a comprehensive listing and does not release the Contractor from identification, proper handling of hazardous/toxic materials, and submittal of the appropriate MSDS to assure adequate safety and protection of life and property.

     a. All hazardous materials to be used in the project shall be coordinated through the Randolph AFB Base Contracting Office, 12 LGC/LGCA, (210)652-5169. A copy of all Manufacturer specific Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's) shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer a minimum of 10 calendar days prior to the delivery of the materials. This includes any material in a liquid, gel or semi-solid state. Additionally, the size and/or weight of each container must be provided with the MSDS.  The Installation Hazardous Materials Program (IHMP) Management Office, located in Hangar 62, is responsible for the approval of all hazardous Materials proposed in the project.  This requirement is mandatory on all projects, as all hazardous materials used on Randolph AFB must be documented and tracked to meet all Environmental Reporting requirements.

     b. Once all MSDS?s have been reviewed, an inventory listing will be provided to the Contractor to use for tracking and consumption purposes.  The inventory list will include the stock number, nomenclature, manufacturer, container size, estimated quantity to be used, contract number, contract quality assessment evaluator's name or government point of contact, and contract performance period.  Notify 12 MSG/CEV when such chemicals/materials are being used and the quantity that will be brought on base.  At this point the contractor and the IHMP office will coordinate on reporting increments to collect consumption data throughout the contract period.  

2.5.  INSTALLATION:  The contractor shall be required to install the shelters and associated safety and construction equipment which include flight line construction barricades, as directed by air field management and the contracting officer.  Barricades are required around the staging of the shelter being moved and at the final location after the shelter is in place.  Work shall be coordinated between all interested parties at a pre-installation meeting prior to mobilization.

Aggressive air test. 10. Open ports to vent outside? Yes 11. Negative air method on radiators? As with all equipment to be cleaned it will depend on the cleaning method the Contractor utilizes. If aggressive cleaning methods are used, then negative air containment will be required. If the Contractor can clean w/wet methods, then negative containment would not be required. 12. Can the water from the radiators, once it has been tested clean, go down Gov't drains? Yes 13. How do Contractor's "quantify" the dust material? Based on established limits provided using dust wipe samples and visible dust accumulations. 14.

If aggressive cleaning methods are used then negative air containment will be required. If the Contractor can clean w/wet methods then negative containment would not be required. 15. Is a Safety Job Hazard meeting required and if so, how long would it take? Yes, it would require approximately 2 hours.  There will also be a Safety Meeting that will require approximately 1 hour. 16. Is there 360 or 440 electrical power? Yes, but Gov't needs 48 hour notification. Change Section 5.2 to read: In the absence of any regulatory based clearance level, the level at which an area is considered to be clean is the pre-abatement asbestos air concentration or 0.1 fibers/cubic centimeter, whichever is greater, as measured by Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFP FOR A FULL SCALE RADIATOR DEMONSTRATION UNIT SECOND GENERATION RDU.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFP and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to: 1) Extend the Proposal Submittal Deadline, 2) Correct references to the Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet, 3) Answer questions received on the April 20th Question Submittal Deadline, 4) Post the Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet (Attachment C), and 5) Create a Question Submittal Deadline for the Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet. 1) The due date for receipt of offers IS hereby extended to 5:00 pm EST Wednesday, May 16th, 2007.  Again, e-mailed proposals will not be accepted.   2) Solicitation references to Cost/Price Documents as Attachment B and Attachment E are hereby corrected. The Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet is actually Attachment C.  3) The following are the questions (selected questions are paraphrased) submitted on the Question Submittal deadline and the corresponding answers:   Q1: The RFP states the desired operating temperatures of the panel should be between 450 K and 350 K.  What is the expected temperature range for the eventual Nuclear Power Generation (NPG) waste heat rejection application? A1: The operating temperatures and conditions for the Second Generation RDU are given in Section III. Design Requirements, paragraphs 11 and 12, and the nominal operating condition inlet fluid temperature is 400 K. Q2: The solicitation mentions micrometeroid protection for the manifold.  Should this criterion be included in the design and fabrication of this component? A2: Section II. Reference Radiator Concept is meant to provide a context for the Second Generation RDU and is not part of the requirements, so there is no micrometeoroid protection requirement. Q3: Are the only structural requirements for the panel assembly that 1) it can be mounted vertically and 2) it can support its own weight for the duration of testing? A3: The panel must also be able to support its own weight in a horizontal position (Section III. Design Requirements, paragraph 6).  The unit is strictly for laboratory testing and does not have vibration or launch load requirements. Q4: Are there any geometric restrictions on the manifold size (i.e. tube diameter), or can the sizing be driven by the technical requirements and the discretion of the Offeror? A4: There are no restraints on the manifold design other than the technical requirements listed in Section III. Design Requirements, paragraph 10 and elsewhere in the section.  The Offeror may select any size and configuration for the manifold required to meet the requirements without further constraints. Q5: Is there a preferred type of high emissivity coating desired by NASA for the panel? A5: No- it is expected that the Offeror will select a coating (or no coating) during the Base Contract Design Study. Q6: Can you provide more information regarding the vacuum-suitable connectors that are compatible with Vacuum Facility #6 as well as the needed electrical interfaces? A6: Vacuum Facility #6 will fully enclose the Second Generation RDU assembly.  All feed throughs for the chamber will be the sole responsibility of the Government and are not to be provided by the Offeror. The Offeror is expected to provide standard fittings (e.g., NPT, Conflat, Swagelok, etc.) for the manifold to connect to the heating loop.  The fittings are to be designed for operation in the pressure range of 10-4 to 10-7 torr with minimal outgassing and leakage under the operating conditions listed in Section III. Design Requirements, paragraphs 11 and 12.  It is expected but not required that these will be commercially available fittings from a vendor specializing in vacuum fittings. Likewise connections for the thermocouples, RTDs and any other Offeror supplied hardware should be capable of operating in a pressure range of 10-4 to 10-7 torr with minimal outgassing or other undesirable characteristics under the operating conditions for the panel listed in Section III. Design Requirements, paragraphs 11 and 12.  Electrical power for the heating loop, DAQ system, etc., will be provided by the Government.  The Offeror is expected to provide a junction box, disconnect, electrical plug, or other similar termination where the Government can easily connect power to the system.  The Government will be responsible for providing any required electrical wire, outlets, conduit, etc., for connecting the units to the electrical power. As stated in Section VI. Government Furnished Property (GFP), paragraph 8, the Government can provide 110V, 208V and 440V power.	Any other voltage will require the Offeror to provide a step up or step down transformer.  The Government will be responsible for providing sufficient amperage to supply the units.  It is expected that approximate electrical requirements will be provided as part of the Preliminary Designs listed in Section VIII. Deliverables to ensure that sufficient power is available when the equipment is delivered. Q7: Is there a pressure drop requirement for the flow through the manifold? A7: No, but the Offeror must design the heating loop proposed for Section IV.  Contract Option II For Heating Loop taking into account the pressure drop in the manifold that they design. Q8: What is the total available funding? A8: Funding information will not be released at this time. Q9: The RFP has several small business/small disadvantaged subcontracting provisions (Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 16%, FAR 52.219-4, 52.219-23, etc.).  Do these provisions apply to small businesses? A9: Small Businesses are not required to meet the Subcontracting Goal.	Offerors should consult the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) concerning the applicability of other related provisions.   Q10: Several clauses are not applicable.  Will the resulting contract be tailored to delete inapplicable clauses? A10: As stated in Section L, Proposal Preparation Instructions, (G)(1)(b), Offerors shall include a listing of exceptions and deviations taken to the RFP.  The listed 'exceptions and deviations' will be reviewed by the Government and inapplicable clauses deleted.  The Government reserves the right to add applicable clauses to the resultant contract. Q11: Can you provide Attachment B and Attachment E?  These attachments are referenced in the Volume II Cost Proposal preparation section.  Q12: The Attachments are incorrectly referenced in the Solicitation.  There is only one Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet- Attachment C.      4) Attachment C Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet is posted with this Amendment.  Offerors may modify the spreadsheet as necessary to provide an accurate reflection of the Offerors cost/pricing structure and/or information.  Supporting cost/pricing information may be submitted in an Offeror selected format. 5) Questions concerning the Cost/Pricing Spreadsheet must be in writing (via e-mail) to Daniel Rodriguez at Daniel.Rodriguez-1@nasa.gov no later than 5:00 pm EST Monday, May 7th, 2007.   Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 4th, 2007. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATION SB1341-07-RQ-0155
AMENDMENT #0002

The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions, and extend the due date for quotes.

(1) The following responses are provided to technical questions submitted: 

QUESTION:  There are a number of traditional approaches used in rheology to provide environmental protection, which, in many cases, is sample specific.  Do you have a specific method in mind or are you simply looking to provide a sealed enclosure to keep the sample isolated from the atmosphere while in the oven and at temperature?  If so, do you also want to inject a specific environment into the sample chamber?  Or, is this something you expect to use for a some specific samples over a specific temperature range? 

ANSWER:  NIST?s requirement is to have a general-purpose environmental chamber such as conventional oven with broad range of operating temperature and then purge with inert gas.  Such an arrangement must be compatible with any DMA tool for mechanical properties if we wish to buy it in future.

QUESTION:  Over the years, researchers have looked at various optical approaches to understand their material's behavior.  What is the orientation of interest; from the bottom of the sample looking up or from the side edge of the sample looking in? With plate or couette geometry?  What is the camera resolution?  Do you want to this option over the same temperature range or just at room temperature?

ANSWER:  NIST?s requirement is to study the microstructure of the sample looking through the plate while it is being sheared. The orientation is not relevant as long as we can study the microstructure of the sample during shear.  NIST uses parallel plate or cone and plate geometry. The Camera must allow us to take movies in the shear rate range 0.5 per second to 1000 per second of the microstructure ranging from 5 microns to 1-2 mm. NIST?s requirement is to work in temperature range between ?20 to 250 degrees Celsius.

(2)  The due date for quotations is hereby changed to read as follows:  FROM:  Friday, April 27, 2007, at 3:30 PM EST, TO: Wednesday, May 2, 2007, at 12:00 PM EST.

<DESC>04-5-2007,  9:07 a.m.
Response to questions submitted for RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111:
Questions 26-35

Please note:  
(1)  Questions 1 through 5 have been asked and responded to via Amendment 4 on FEDBIZOPS.   Questions 6-17 have been answered via Amendment 5 on FEDBIZOPS. Questions 18-25  were  answered via Amendment 7 on FEDBIZOPS.  These questions are numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions asked and answered for this particular RFP.

(2)  Cut-off date for Questions for this Solicitation is 3:00 p.m. EST, April 5, 2007.

Question 26:  There are parts of the SEC response to questions in amendments 9 and 10 that imply the SEC is still reviewing the request and will respond via amendments to be issued.  See LINE ITEM 0007, question 36.  The due date is April 9 and with pending answers plus the questions herein, we request consideration for an additional delay which will allow adequate time to prepare a response.  

Response:    All previous questions have been answered via amendments to the Solicitation.  The revisions to the RFP have been posted and e-mailed to all that requested the information.  The due date of April 9, 2007 will stand.

Question 27:  Throughout the amendments there appears to be an SEC definition of CFMS relative to commercial practices and that the terms are interchangeable.  For example, the requirement for stating a bidders CFMS commercial revenue.  CFMS is a schedule and definition of the Federal Acquisition Service and really has no definition in the in the commercial marketplace.  As a contract office furniture dealer, what we do commercially every day is what CFMS is all about.

Response:  The SEC is seeking corporate experience in the business that is similar to what is being requested in the SOW.

Question 28:  Please provide additional definition for Section B and the use of, NTE __percentage of CLINs, and how Note 4 applies.  Is the $3,000,000 the fee or is that the planned expense for furniture items?

Response:  $3M is estimated not to exceed the pool of to be funding available for the purchase of furniture for Project No. 2.  The actual amount will be included in future task orders.  The percentage NTE was incorporated at the suggestion of many at the pre-proposal conference that is based on the total amount of furniture purchase funding.

Question 29:  The requirements of the Technical proposal for the furniture portion C.2 is virtually impossible to write since the SEC has provided no information regarding the furniture requirements, i.e. systems versus private office, etc., consequently we cannot see any how to structure a meaningful response.

Response:  This portion of the contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract.  We will need office furnishings as stated in the RFP.  We have provided information as to the square foot of each SEC location, and the number of employees that we have in each location.  We?ve chosen this type of contracting vehicle (IDIQ) to respond to office furnishing needs as required.

Question 30:  One of the additional examples of the confusion caused by the use of CFMS terminology is the requirement for CFMS experience for delivery personnel.  Once again, CFMS is just a schedule definition by the Federal Acquisition Service to define specific services relative to contract furniture.

Response:  The SEC is using the labor category descriptions from the GSA schedule that were suggested at the pre-proposal conference.  The SEC?s detailed requirements for CFMS services is explained in the RFP.

Question 31:  In one of the earlier amendments, you were kind enough to list those organizations that had requested the Solicitation.  Is it possible to receive an updated list and also a list of attendees at the pre-bid conference?

<DESC>03-23-07,  4:15 p.m.  Response to questions submitted for RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111:
Questions 18 – 25

Please note:  Questions 1 through 5 have been asked and responded to via Amendment 4 on FEDBIZOPS.   Questions 6 – 17 have been answered via Amendment 5 on FEDBIZOPS. Questions 18 – 26  will be answered via Amendment 7 on FEDBIZOPS.  These questions are numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions asked and answered for this particular RFP.


Question 18:  Item number 0005:  Are the additional fees for delay in delivery based on daily or a monthly schedules?  The format on page 2 appears to default on 30 days (i.e., additional days are billed at a minimum of 1 month) but the H.8 reference stipulates daily billing.  In either case, will the SEC clarify the billing basis for all bidders (s.f., weight, item count....).  For our purposes, the procedure for measuring storage would also need to be clarified once they define the rate basis.

Response:  The SEC requests a daily rate for this line item.  We anticipate that the storage requirement for the CDC would not exceed a total of 30 days.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A REVISED ANSWER FROM QUESTION NUMBER 9.  Further discussion allowed for a change in our thinking.  ITEM NUMBER 0005 WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DAILY RATE.

Question 19:  administration.  For the base period and option periods, you are requesting a lot price for administration.  Since the level of effort can vary significantly dependent upon the number and size of each task order, please provide the parameters that should be used in determining the lot price.

Response:  For line item 0002, administrative fee for the CDC shall be proposed as one lot and is a firm requirement.  Offerors should propose their fee for this task from contract award through final completion of all deliverables.  For the Commission wide administrative fee line items for the SEC furniture, Offerors should propose a percentage of the funding as their administrative fee

Question 20:  assembly and delivery.  For the base period and option periods, is it acceptable to submit labor categories and their respective labor rates?

Response:  The SEC will revise these items to be priced once firm requirements are known and a task order issued.

Question 21:  storage fee.   For the base period and options, is it acceptable to submit the storage fee per day per space or shipping weight of items?

Response:  The SEC will revise these items to a price per sf, to be priced once firm requirements are known and a task order issued. (See Amendment #6 in FEDBIZOPS).

Question 22:  Replacement or Upgraded Furniture.  Since there is no mention about relocating existing furniture, shall we assume that areas receiving this furniture are empty and are ready for installation?

Response:  Yes.

Question 23:   Clarify the intention of product verification into and out of the warehouse should be clarified in terms of item verification.  Typically bulk freight is received from the shipper/manufacturer, then we verify the item descriptions and quantities listed on the purchasing docs/bill of lading.  This does not usually include unwrapping the individual items unless there is clear physical damage to the outside of the packing materials/container. If there is damage, we note the damages and alert our clients immediately.  The main argument for leaving packaging intact on items (provided we're able to verify item description and quantity through the wrap) is to keep the items clean while in storage.  Additionally, leaving the packaging intact will greatly reduce handling damages during redelivery.  If we are required to completely remove packaging, we will then need to factor in additional packing costs for redelivery.

Response:  The SEC has several concerns with this proposed process: 1) if the items are stored for several months unopened and unassembled, then opened and assembled on-site and there are missing parts, wrong item shipped, item is

<DESC>03-23-07,  1:40 p.m.  Response to questions submitted for RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111:
Questions 6 – 17

Please note:  Questions 1 through 5 have been asked and responded to via Amendment 4 on FEDBIZOPS.  These questions are numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions asked and answered for this particular RFP.

Question 6:  The spreadsheet developed by SKB appears twice; once as an eleven (11) page document and again as a thirteen (13) page document.  They appear to be similar, if not identical.  Please clarify.

Response:  Yes, they are identical.  The 11 page document is in PDF format.  The 13 page document is an Excel Spreadsheet.

Question 7:  The requirement for LEED CI information plus sustainability documentation is well documented.  However, since the specifications are to be held as to manufacturer and product as well as finish/fabrics, etc. how should one respond when that respective manufacturer cannot, or will not, provide any documentation?  Many of the items for the CDC, such as diaper changing pads, boombox, air purifier, etc., will probably have no information nor any need to have sustainability information.  Many of the vendors listed (Toys R Us, Staples, Best Buy) have equipped to provide this kind of documentation, even should it exist, for simple sales.  Should we only be accountable for those manufacturers who have the information and will provide it?

Response:  Paragraph C.2.9 will be changed to read:  “The CDC is seeking a LEED-CI Silver Rating and the items identified in the Attachment (1) Product Data Catalog, to the extent available, have been identified as meeting LEED requirements, therefore the contractor shall ensure that the exact item (make, model, etc.) is purchased.  Any exceptions or substitutions shall be submitted per the instructions contained in paragraph C.2.3.  The criteria specified below and in Attachment (2) Section 018113 – Sustainable Design Requirements is provided for your information:”

Question 8:  In Section C.2.5, Assembly …, the requirement is for items to be assembled in our premises (Distribution Center) and then transported to the site.  It is our experience that less damage and a more efficient installation occurs when we deliver and then un-carton, assemble, and distribute within the site.  At that point, all trash, packing material, etc. is removed and recycled if appropriate.  Will the SEC accept that process?

Response:  The SEC has several concerns with this proposed process: 1) if the items are stored for several months unopened and unassembled, then opened and assembled on-site and there are missing parts, wrong item shipped, item is damaged or broken, or any other issue that would then cause a last minute scramble to obtain a replacement piece.  2) the CDC will have a brand new rubber floor and we are unwilling to risk damage to this floor through furniture and equipment assembly.  3)  Items such as cribs, tricycles, baby buggies, chairs, desks, can and should be assembled off-site.  Very large or cumbersome items, such as the play loft could be assembled on-site and the SEC is willing to consider this on a case-by-case basis subject to coordination with the SEC, the construction contractor and the architect.  It is of utmost importance that the CDC be ready for operation by the appointed time.  

Question 9:  In Section B.1, CLIN 0005, Storage Fee.  Our CFMS contract is based on pricing storage by the square foot.  It is difficult to determine what that requirement may be for the CDC and can only be determined after receipt of the goods.  Is there a provision that can be added where we provide the square-foot cost with the amount of square feet to be determined and agreed upon?

Response:  Line Items 0005, 0009, 0013 and 0017 qty/unit will be changed to square foot rather than a daily rate.  The contractor should estimate the amount of square feet need based on the items to be purchased under the Attachment (1) Product Data Catalog.  We wou

Line Item 0005-Storage Fee for authorized delay in delivery 
Note:  Clarification.  This line item is placed in the RFP in the event of delays caused and authorized by the SEC.  This will be tied to a milestone.  The qty/unit is PER SQUARE FOOT PER DAY as noted in the amendments.
Question 34:	Is there any licensing going on here?
Response:	Yes there is, through Washington, DC.
Question 35:	Licensing requires furniture to be in place?
Response:	Yes.
SECTION B.2 ? Comprehensive Furniture Management Services (CFMS), Commission-wide Program to Replace and Upgrade Office Furniture (SEC Offices)
NOTE:  This is Project No. 2.  It is the IDIQ part of the Contract.  The SEC is looking for other options for furniture purchase.  This requirement runs the gamut of what you would see in a typical office.  For the administration fee for this effort, the Contractor will quote a percentage of the task order.  This is a standalone SEC Contract, NOT under GSA.
Line Item 0007-Administration of the CFMS task order requirements
Question 36:  	Our GSA contract requires an hourly rate for the fee.
Question/Comment 37:	This takes away the contractors incentive to buy discount.  Would you consider an hourly rate with a percentage cap?
Response to Questions 36 and 37:	The SEC will take these questions and comments into consideration.  Any change will be noted in an Amendment to the Solicitation.
Question 38:	If the furniture goes out of region, would it impact the hourly rate for 0007?
Response:	No.  The big delta is on installation.
Question 39:	Is the SEC looking for hourly rates now or do you want hourly rates later?
Response:	Now.  We need as much up front information  as possible.
Question 40:	Can we get a breakdown of the number of  SEC employees by location and the square foot of each location?  Also, can we get the floor number for each location and the loading dock specifications?
Response:	The SEC will provide the number of SEC employees by location, the square feet of each SEC location, and the floor number for each location via Amendment to the Solicitation on FEDBIZOPS.  We will provide the loading dock specifications for each location if required during the task order process.
Question 41:	Will the results of this meeting be posted for all parties?
Response:	Yes.
Other Questions/Comments:
Question 42:	You said you would accept e-mail for the proposal delivery.  You also requested 1 hard copy to follow.  Do you need more than 1 hard copy?  How large of a file can you receive electronically?
Response:	Yes, e-mail is acceptable for the delivery date of 9 April 2007, 4:30 PM EST.  The hard copy should follow.  We are going to request 1 original and 3 hard copies of the proposal to be sent overnight (express) to be received no later than 10 April 2007, 4:30 PM EST.  We will respond via Amendment to answer the size of electronic file that can be received via e-mail.  We will send an e-mail receipt of proposal delivery.
Question 43:	What will be the turn around time after the proposals have been received?
Response:	Turnaround time depends on the amount of proposals received.  We would like to make award within two weeks, but it depends on the complexity and volume of proposals received.
Question 44:	Under corporate experience, you request experience between the years 2003-2005.  Did you mean 2006?
Response:	We will change to reflect corporate experience needed for the past 3 years, 2004-2006.
Question 45:	By using the word, commercial, are you meaning projects of this scope or a private vs. commercial effort?
Response:	We are talking about the flavor or type of the project.  It does not matter if it was for a private industry or commercial industry.
Question 46:	Is there going to be an award debrief?
Response:	No, unless it is requested.  If requested, we will do an award debrief.

Project- Comprehensive Furniture Management Services, CFMS, Child Development Center, CDC

Clarification is given for the following Questions/Comments:
LINE ITEM 0002-Administration of the CFMS Program
Question-Comment 28:   In our industry, we are usually allowed to bill for administrative costs up to a certain percent throughout the procurement of the items.  A small percentage is left to invoice by the time the work is completed. Will you revisit this issue?  It is hard on the contractor to receive payment in this manner.
Response:	 The SEC will take this under advisement and revisit this issue.  We will determine if we will revise this requirement or if it will remain the same.
Question-Comment 29:	How about attaching the administrative costs to some milestones or tying the costs to the deliverables?
Response:	The SEC will take this under advisement and comment via an Amendment to the Solicitation.
Question 30:	Are you entertaining an hourly rate at all?
Response:	No.

CLARIFYING DETERMINATION FOR QUESTIONS 36-37:

Proposal Conference
Wednesday, March 28, 2007,1:00 p.m.

NOTES


Overview
Project 1 - CDC:  We need a contractor to manage all the procurements of the Child Development Center (CDC).  Our goal is to open the CDC on September 10, 2007.  The CDC will be a LEED commercial interior space.  We have been very specific in the RFP in requesting the LEED products and have asked for brand name specifics.  If the brand names are not available, the company is to find a suitable replacement.  The replacement must be approved by the SEC in writing.  We are on a very tight schedule and require delivery of the CDC products in mid August as requested in the RFP.  Lead times are critical.
Project 2-SEC Replacement Furniture:  Any LEEDs related requirements for this project would be identified in the individual Task Order.  Contractor is required to purchase replacement furniture for the SEC offices nationwide.
Question/Answers/Clarifications 
[Please note that the questions will be numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions that were asked and answered in previous amendments on FEDBIZOPS.  This will allow for clarity of identification of questions when referencing.]
SECTION B.1  Comprehensive Furniture Management Services (CFMS), Child Development Center (CDC)
Line Item 0002-Administration of the CFMS Program
Question 26:	The RFP requests the contractor to provide a FFP for administration of the CFMS program.  Why cannot the contractor bill the SEC until the end of the project?:
Response:	 This is a fixed price requirement. The administration price is a subprice.  The contractor can bill for everything else throughout the process.  This line item can be billed at the very end.  It is the SECs incentive to get the job completed.
Question 27:	Line item 1 is for product, Line Item 2 is for service?
Response:  	Yes.
Question/Comment 28:   In our industry, we are usually allowed to bill for administrative costs up to a certain percent throughout the procurement of the items.  A small percentage is left to invoice by the time the work is completed. Will you revisit this issue?  It is hard on the contractor to receive payment in this manner.
Response:	 The SEC will take this under advisement and revisit this issue.  We will determine if we will revise this requirement or if it will remain the same.
Question/Comment 29:	How about attaching the administrative costs to some milestones or tying the costs to the deliverables?
Response:	The SEC will take this under advisement and comment via an Amendment to the Solicitation.
Question 30:	Are you entertaining an hourly rate at all?
Response:	No.  
Line Item 0003-Warehousing of items
Note:	Remember - The SEC will entertain assembly on-site on a case by case basis, for example, the assembling of the large loft for the CDC.
Question 31:	Where will the acceptance punch list be approved?  How will it occur?
Response:	The acceptance punch list for the contract will be approved on site at the SECs CDC.  The Contractor is responsible for the acceptance for the initial acceptance upon purchase from the vendor.  The SEC will have an acceptance punch list done on the day the product is installed at the CDC.  It is up to the Contractor to assure safe delivery of items to the CDC.
Question 32:	Can we assume that no other contractors will be in that space after delivery of items?  This question pertains to the security of the items.
Response:	Yes, the plan is that no one except SEC authorized personnel and the Contractor will be in the space during the timeframe authorized for delivery.  This is a highly secure facility.  The security systems start once the equipment/furniture/toys are delivered.  The COTR or a designated SEC representative will be with the contractor upon delivery of the items.
Question 33:	Who will have control of the CDC security during the installation?
Response:	The

<DESC>The SEC intends to establish one contract vehicle which encompasses the SEC's CFMS requirements; however, subcontracting and/or teaming are encouraged in a manner which is transparent to the Government.  The SEC reserves the right to make single or multiple awards for these services, as well as the right to make no award pursuant to this RFP. In the event of multiple awards for these services, multiple awards will not be made in a manner that encompasses both tasks.  A separate award may be made for Project No. 1 - Child Development Center (CDC) and Project No. 2 - Commission-Wide Program to Replace And/Or Upgrade Office Furniture.  The intent is to contract with one vendor to manage the entire CFMS process; however, multiple awards may be considered to manage Project 1 and Project 2 independently.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6 Streamlined Procedurs for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the Request for Proposals. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a requirement for a Contractor to furnish Comprehensive Furniture Management Services (CFMS). Specifically, the contractor shall provide the SEC with CFMS in support of two projects:  Project No.1 - Standing up the new child development center (CDC) and Project No. 2 - Commission-wide program to replace and/or upgrade office furniture. The Contractor shall furnish comprehensive furniture management services (CFMS) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation. Project No. 1 consists of the following:  The Contractor shall provide CFMS for the SEC's new CDC, which is located on the ground floor of the headquarters building, Station Place One, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C.  The SEC requires that the center will be complete and open for business at 8:00 a.m. EST on September 10, 2007. Services shall include the purchase, warehousing, assembly, delivery and installation of the furnishings and equipment. The Contractor shall plan, organize, and coordinate with SEC personnel; the SEC's architect, SKB Architecture and Design (SKB); the SEC's general Contractor, Turner Construction; and other SEC construction subContractors concerning all aspects of furnishing the CDC. The Contractor shall ensure proper and safe placement of furniture, office material and specialized area contents, and equipment such as office and classroom furniture, equipment, toys, laundry and kitchen appliances, strollers/buggies, etc.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, supplies, warehouse space, tools, and equipment necessary to perform the CFMS services required under this contract in an orderly, safe, and efficient manner.  Project No. 2 - Commission-wide program to replace and/or upgrade office furniture consists of the following: The Contractor shall provide CFMS for the replacement and/or upgrade of office furniture and office furniture-related items as defined under individual task orders.  The specific services shall be the same as those for the CDC, but will focus on office furnishings and equipment.  Furniture shall include but is not limited to desks, credenzas, file cabinets, bookcases, chairs, tables, accessories. Equipment shall include but is not limited to fax machines, copiers, scanners, microwave ovens, refrigerators.  Proposals are being requested.  A copy of the Solicitation with instructions for submitting a Proposal in response to Request for Proposals No. SECHQ1-07-R-0111 may be requested by email.  Potential vendors are requested to be registered with the Central Conractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for award.  The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. Questions may be addressed to D. Miller at (202) 551-8254 or via email to millerd@sec.gov. Late proposals will not be accepted or considered.
ld not be able to accept a price for these line items after contract award.

Question 10:  We cannot identify any specifications for these items (Commission wide program Items 0006 through 0017) within the document we have received.  What is the SEC looking for in a response?  Even though “teaming” is an acceptable process with a wide variety of manufacturers, not every manufacturer is willing to participate or offer appropriate credit terms to facilitate a program.

Response:   As stated in Section C.3, requirements for the Commision wide program will be defined in individual task orders.  Each task order will define the type of furniture desired (e.g. desks, chairs, fax machines, copiers) the quantity, destination office, etc.  The task order will also provide the funding to the contractor to purchase the desired items.  The SEC anticipates that the contractor will then seek quotes from a variety of manufacturers and award a purchase order, including full funding, to the one meeting the criteria under the most favorable terms (description, price, delivery).

Question 11:  The list under CLINS 0008, 0012, 0016 for delivery and installation will vary by each location depending on the labor market.  In addition, these prices vary due to loading dock and elevator issues, permits, security, and time of day or weekend work.  To provide hourly rates in each market is possible but will take some time to get that documentation and then will have to presented market-by-market.

Response:  The SEC has revised Section B, CLINS 0008, 0009, 0012, 0013, 0016, and 0017 to request pricing per each office location and has been marked TBD (to be determined) so the contractor can obtain a realistic quote under individually issued task orders.

Question 12:  The same issue for Storage as was noted previously for Washington, DC but again, each market will be different as noted above.  How should we proceed?

Response:  See response to question 11 above.





Question 13:  Can an offer be made for one of the two programs or must a bidder respond to both parts?

Response:  The SEC issued amendment 03, posted to FEDBIZOps on March 15, 2007, which allows offerors the opportunity to quote on either one or the other program or both, if desired.

Question 14:  What is the method for award?  How will the offers be evaluated?  We note that invoicing for services on the CDC portion cannot occur to after September 10 whereas the installation is to be complete by August 17.  Why the delay?

Response:  Please see section M of the solicitation for the method of award and evaluation criteria.  The only item where invoices cannot be submitted for payment until after the entire project is completed is CLIN 0002, the administration fee.   Invoices for all other CLINS can be submitted as the project progresses. 

Question 15:   How do we provide evidence of paid invoices when many of the items listed for the CDC will be paid by credit card?  Are those receipts acceptable?  What required documentation for invoices paid by check? Copies of cancelled checks with bank processes of today can be an administrative nightmare – but a copy check that has been issued is very feasible.

Response:  Yes receipts for credit card purchases are acceptable.  Copies of cancelled checks are not required.  An invoice from the manufacturer stating that it has been paid in full is acceptable evidence.

Question 16:  We suggest that a pre-bid meeting for all bidders be held so all are working with the same criteria.

Response:  A proposal conference has been scheduled for Wednesday, March 28, 2007 at 1:00 p.m. at the SEC’s Headquarters Office (Station Place), 101 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C.  20549.  The conference will be held in room #3000, 3rd floor.  Interested bidders wishing to participate in the conference should call or e-mail the point of contact, Debbie Miller (202) 551-8254/millerd@sec.gov. 

Question 17:  We formally request a delay in the due date and that 10 working days after all amendments are issued be allowed for preparing a response.

Response:  The SEC has provided a valid, clearly written Request for Proposal for this effort.  However, we have received substantial questions that we would like to be addressed in the proposal response.  The SEC will extend the due date for this RFP to NLT 4:30 p.m. EST, Monday, April 9, 2007.

<DESC>This amendment provides changes made to the RFP based on the March 28, 2007 Proposal Conference.

Section B.2 has been changed as follows:

PLEASE REQUEST REVISED SECTION B.2 VIA E-MAIL TO MILLERD@SEC.GOV.  These revisions include new labor rates.

Section L.1 of the RFP has been changed as follows:

L.1	Preparation of Proposals.  Offerors shall submit one original and four hard copies of both the Technical Proposal and Business Proposal containing the information set forth below.  The Business Proposal containing pricing shall be submitted in a separate volume from the Technical Proposal.  The Technical and Business Proposals shall be separate and complete so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the other.  Offerors shall also provide a copy of the Technical and Business Proposals on disk in Microsoft Office Compatible software.

Section L.6.4.3 Factor 3 of the RFP has been changed as follows:

Question 32:  When asking for corporate experience in Section L it is consistently referred to a, commercial CFMS, rather than just CFMS experience.  Do you only want commercial experience or all CFMS experience that is equivalent to the work being proposed?

Response:  Yes, we would like all CFMS experience that is equivalent to the work being proposed.

Question 33:  How will travel costs be handled after contract award?  Will the individual task orders have a travel CLIN?

Response:    Travel is proposed consistent with the GSA travel regulations and will be funded via individual task orders when needed.

Question 34:  I am still concerned about the limitation on Corporate Experience to only commercial experience.  We were the first CFMS schedule holder for GSA and we have extensive experience of similar size and scope in the federal sector and would like to use this experience in our corporate experience section.  Please clarify if we can use federal CFMS experience.

Response:  Please see question 32.  The response is the same:  we would like all CFMS experience that is equivalent to the work being proposed.

Question 35:  For the newly proposed labor rates with the percentages attached to them, we believe that if we propose a NTE percentage of the previous line item, we may not make but a marginal profit.  For instance, if we order one chair for the UTAH office, and the chair costs $200, we will only make $20 if they use our plan for labor rates.  Are we correct in our understanding of this?

Response:  The revised price breakdown for the CLINs in question,newly pro posed labor rates, was a result of the Q& A section of the proposal conference.  Our response to the pricing of the administrative fee for Project  No. 2 tasks was to provide a cost breakdown that included hourly rates plus a percentage cap for the fee.  It is our understanding that this is industry standard.
