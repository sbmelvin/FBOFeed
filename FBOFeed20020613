<CONTACT>TERRY W. CARROLL, PROCUREMENT TECHNICIAN, FAX 703-787-1009
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-20. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (OCT 2000); 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (APR 1998), with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (AUG 2000). Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-85256; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract for consultation, review and recommendations for the design of the MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program) Option Value Model. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) by virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, the Submerged Lands Act, and pursuant to delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Interior has jurisdiction over leasing and development of OCS submerged lands and mineral development. In conjunction with this jurisdiction, the MMS is required to follow the overall Mineral Management goals as stated in the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978.   Related to the MMS's responsibilities under the OCS Lands Act is staff analysis of environmental and resource information in conjunction with OCS oil and gas lease sales. In particular, the bid adequacy analysis for the high bids received at blocks offered for lease attempts to ensure that the Federal Government receives fair market value for those blocks. A procedure for reviewing bids and determining whether they are adequate has been developed by MMS.  To assist in placing values on these blocks, computer models are used. The proprietary computer program used by MMS in the determination of the fair market value of a block is called MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program). The mathematical methodology and statistical approach by the model is critical to ensure the correct fair market value assessment.  MMS is preparing an optimization model that would be teamed in some way with MONTCAR. 	The optimization model that we have in view is often termed "real option valuation."  Option Value (OV) is the result of optimization of uncertain net present value (NPV) over time.  In calculating option value, the timing of activities is flexible and is variable within the optimizing model, instead of being assumed in terms of a fixed scenario. MMS expects to accomplish this work by the following steps:  1) MMS staff members prepare a requirement's document, design plan, and a model prototype;  2) The requirements document, plan, and prototype is critically reviewed by a consultant under this contract with constructive recommendations;  3) The consultant's comments are reviewed, and, if agreed to, implemented by MMS staff.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain consultation, review, and recommendations for the design of the Option Value Model and its interface with MONTCAR. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT:  The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of twelve (12) months and a cost of $30,000.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor shall (1) attend a kick-off meeting at MMS headquarters in Herndon, Virginia within 1 month of the award where the contract requirements and detailed statement of work will be reviewed in detail.  The contractor shall prepare a written summary of discussion and agreements reached in the kick-off meeting within 30 days of the meeting. (2) The Contractor will critically review MMS' design plan, prototype OV model, and strategy for model development.  The Contractor will provide constructive recommendations for modifying current plans and OV model, including discussion and recommendations for the technical issues raised. The extent of Contractor's review,  discussions, consultation and recommendations will include: (a)  review of research literature as applied to basic option models of oil leases, emphasizing the latest literature, including a bibliography;  (b) explain the pros and cons of alternative numerical techniques including binomial tree, Monte Carlo and finite difference techniques as they might be applied to the MONTCAR OV model; recommendation regarding the single vs. compound option approach relating to decisions to explore and/or develop the lease; (c) explain the principal variants of the Brownian Motion (BM) and Mean-Reverting (MR) model processes and cover detailed topics to encompass modeling prices in levels or in logs including a deterministic trend term or not, the statistical techniques that would be used to determine the model parameters, then recommend a price process to use in the OV MONTCAR model;  (d) discus price models explaining how to estimate volatility and compute probabilities for the recommended price model and solution technique; (e)  discuss various time step assumptions necessary for lead time on development; (f) discuss the discount rate issue for the calculation of OV and explain principal alternative ways of reflecting  unhedged risk and the developer's risk preference in the OV model, then recommend a discount rate concept and explain how it is estimated from cost of capital data or the like;  (g) discuss convenience yield, how it is estimated and recommend how to treat it in the OV model; (h) discuss practical implementation of prices before and after investment; (i) explain in detail how the recommended OV model links with MONTCAR and give a numerical illustration;  (j) discuss how a single mean price path might be substituted in place of multiple possible price paths from the time of development onwards eliminating unnecessary computations and how they would or would not match up with existing MONTCAR price representations; (k) make recommendations as to specific information needed from MONTCAR runs so that additions and changes to existing models can be programmed by MMS staff members. (3) The Contractor, after completing the investigation of technical topics and finishing the review of the MMS design and prototype,  will draft a final written report giving the findings and recommendations and make an oral presentation with MMS staff at MMS' headquarters to discuss the recommendations.  (4)  The Contractor will revise the draft paper to include material introduced in the oral discussion and transmit the final written report to MMS within one month of the final meeting.   HOW TO RESPOND: Offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement, a Technical Proposal and a firm fixed price.  CAPABILITIES STATEMENT:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel  and organizational experience and facilities in simulation, oil and gas property evaluation, real options, and computer programming; and (2) past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization is currently performing or has completed  within the last three years.  References will be checked.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  detail how you plan to approach the project and tasks;  include a time schedule indicating benchmarks;  specify key personnel, their specific functions and reporting relationships. Indicate who will be the primary point of contact for this project.  COST PROPOSAL:  this will be a firm fixed price type contract.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  the following factors are considered more important than price: (1) Contract Perception:  overall comprehension of project needs and plan of execution; opportunity for MMS interaction and incorporation of comments. (2) Experience:  Program Manager's experience with similar offshore oil and gas modeling projects; quality of experience as demonstrated with recent offshore oil and gas simulation and quantitative statistical modeling; demonstrated experience in real options; quality of experience with C++ as demonstrated with a recent review and explanation of the design, methodology, and algorithms of computer models written using this language; and verbal and writing skills of key personnel in the preparation of oral presentations and written reports dealing with technical and statistical subject areas.   (3) Organization's Personnel: currency of personnel working on similar offshore oil and gas modeling projects; depth of experience working on projects relating to offshore oil and gas property acquisition, incorporation of real option financial modeling into oil and gas property value determination, statistics, simulation, systems analysis and computer programming; education and training in post-graduate mathematics, statistics, and computer programming; (4)  Past Performance:  ability to timely complete projects, adhere to schedules and budgets, produce quality products delivered, and cooperation between key personnel and the client. Between proposals that are evaluated as substantially equal in quality, the price to the Government will be a major factor in selection for an award. The Government may not conduct negotiations so submit your best offer. Contract award shall be to the responsible Offeror, whose acceptable offer, conforming to this RFP, is most advantageous to the Government.  Offerors shall submit their Proposals in original and four copies, by 4:00 P.M.

<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Office of Historical Trust Accounting, U.S. Department of the Interior. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; OFFERS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Contract period is for a base period of one year with two option years. The Government reserves the right to unilaterally extend the period of contract performance in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract--Services". STATEMENT OF WORK: Objective: Long-term support, analysis, and expert legal advice provided to the Office of Historical Trust Accounting and Departmental leadership for the historical accounting on law and practice related to common law trust beneficiaries and private and commercial trustees. BACKGROUND: The Department of the Interior (Department) has the fiduciary responsibility on behalf of the U.S. Government to manage both Tribal trust  funds and Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust funds. These two trust funds and accounts are managed by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST). The Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) was established on July 10, 2001, to plan for and direct the historical accounting of IIM accounts.  The OHTA is developing a Plan for the Historical Accounting (Plan) which must be presented to and approved by the Congress to secure long-term funding, and to the District Court in relation to the Cobell v. Norton litigation (see below).  In creating the OHTA, Interior Secretary Gale Norton set a first charge to prepare an initial plan for what must be addressed in the Plan. This initial plan submitted September 10, 2001, the Blueprint for Developing the Comprehensive Historical Accounting Plan for the Individual Indian Money Accounts, is the framework for preparing the Plan.  The Secretary's second charge was to develop a plan for initial work that can begin before the  is completed.  The OHTA submitted on November 7, 2001, the Report Identifying Preliminary Work for the Historical Accounting.  (Both documents are available on the OHTA website at www.doi.gov/ohta/). The OST, established by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (PL. 103?412), was created to improve the accountability and management of Indian funds held in trust by the Federal Government. Currently, OST maintains approximately 1,400 accounts for 315 Tribal entities with cash and investments of approximately $3.0 billion, and more than 285,000 IIM accounts with cash and investments of approximately $360 million. Annually, approximately $800 million passes through the Tribal trust fund, and approximately $300 million passes through the IIM trust fund. This income is generated from the sale or rental of Indian-owned land and natural resources such as timber, farming, grazing, and royalties from various minerals and oil and  gas exploration and production, and from land use for rights-of-way and easements.  Funds also are derived from interest earned on invested funds, as well as awards or settlements of Tribal or individual Indian claims.  The BIA, along with the Department's Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management, manage the land records, and revenue collection and processing. COBELL V. NORTON: The facts underlying the Cobell v. Norton litigation involve a broad sweep of United States history. Although U.S. policy through the 1870s was to locate Indians on reservations, the government began to break up reservations starting in the 1880s. Thousands of individual Indians were allotted 60- to 120-acre parcels of land in the break-up. The government held these parcels in trust, and established an Individual Indian Monies Trust Fund to collect and disburse to the Indians any revenues generated by mining, oil and gas extraction, timber operations, grazing or similar activities on their land. In June 1996, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Department by five Indian plaintiffs on behalf of Individual Indian Money (IIM) account holders which asked for, in part, the historical accounting of IIM accounts.  The case was divided into two phases: the first phase addressed the Department's efforts to reform the management of IIM trust funds, and the timing and scope of any second phase relating to actual accounting issues is not known at this time. Trial was held during June and July 1999 on the first phase of the complaint.  On December 21, 1999, the U.S. District Court ruled that the Department was in breach of four specific duties.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the ruling of the District Court; however, it stated that the actual legal breach was the failure to provide an accounting. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling provides some guidance on the obligation of the Department to perform an accounting of the IIM accounts. Specifically, the Court of Appeals held that the relationship between the United States and the IIM account holders is a trust relationship that creates fiduciary obligations.  See Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1099-1100 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In addition, the Court of Appeals held that, while the government's obligations are rooted in and outlined by relevant statutes and treaties, they are largely defined in traditional equitable terms: "Where Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity or the common law, a court must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms."  Courts "must infer that Congress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties unless Congress has unequivocally expressed an intent to the contrary." Id. Much as the Supreme Court has regularly turned to the Restatement and other authorities to construe trust responsibilities, it is appropriate for the District Court to consult similar sources. Because of this, the Court of Appeals held that the United States owes a duty to account to the IIM beneficiaries. The Court of Appeals also held that the "1994 Act reaffirms the government's preexisting fiduciary duty to perform a complete historical accounting of trust fund assets," and found that the fair and accurate accounting referenced in Section 102 of the 1994 Act requires "reconciling the accounts, taking into account past deposits, withdrawals, and accruals," as well as reporting of "all items of property, income, and expenses. . . ." Id. at 1102-03.  The Court of Appeals further stated that an "adequate" accounting is one that is "sufficient to serve the purposes for which a trust accounting is typically conducted."  Id. at 1103.  Therefore, the accounting "must contain sufficient information for the beneficiary readily to ascertain whether the trust has been faithfully carried out." Id. The Court of Appeals, however, acknowledged that there were substantial questions yet to be determined about the scope of the accounting owed by the United States.  The Court of Appeals expressly stated that the decisions regarding the nature and scope of the United States' accounting were to be resolved by the Federal Government.  Thus, while noting that the Department's actions would be judged by strict standards based upon the duty to deal fairly with the IIM beneficiaries, the Court of Appeals noted with approval that the District Court had "explicitly left open the choice of how the accounting would be conducted, whether certain accounting methods, such as statistical sampling or something else, would be appropriate.  Such decisions are properly left in the hands of administrative agencies."  Id. at 1104. It is within this context that the Department is designing its approach and will conduct the historical accounting using appropriate methods to fulfill its trust responsibility. HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING PROJECT: As part of the Department's overall trust reform efforts, the Department is undertaking an evaluation of the reliability of past IIM account activity. Part of this work is already underway for the period after enactment of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. That work will not, however, discharge the Department's duty to account as outlined by the two courts. The mission of OHTA is to determine what will be required to meet the Department's duty to account, present the Plan for the work to Congress (and the Court), and upon appropriation of funds needed, implement the accounting. Given the length of time involved, the distinct histories of various groups of trust assets, the various business practices that generated trust income, known or suspected problems in the records, and other historical factors, the development of the Plan for the historical accounting is a complicated task.  Among the things that must be evaluated are the relative costs, utilities, and impact upon beneficiaries of various approaches to providing the accounting for distinct subgroups of accounts or trust assets. The Plan for the accounting must be both fair to beneficiaries and feasible. Based on information developed through public meetings and from related efforts, including substantial work in relation to production of records for the five named plaintiffs, reconciliation of the five named plaintiffs' accounts, additional research and progress toward the historical accounting, and related trust reform efforts, the Department is developing a Plan, as requested by Congress in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations report language, describing in detail how the Department will conduct the historical accounting, the methods to be employed, the anticipated costs, and anticipated levels of confidence and accuracy in the results.   In her Secretarial Order and memorandum of July 10, 2001, Secretary Gale Norton established the OHTA and charged the OHTA with planning and carrying out this historical accounting. NATURE OF THE CONTRACT: This contract is intended to provide the OHTA and the Department with independent expertise in trust and fiduciary law from the perspective of providing trust services to beneficiaries in a private or commercial trust relationship. Generally, the selected attorney contractor will consult with Office of Historical Trust Accounting and Office of the Solicitor staff on an ongoing basis.  The attorney contractor will be asked to review materials provided by the OHTA through the Solicitor's Office and prepare legal memoranda which respond to legal issues presented in the implementation of the historical accounting plan, conducting the accounting, and reporting to beneficiaries. The attorney contractor's work products will be circulated to government staff and/or other government contractors for review and comment, and the attorney contractor may be asked to address such comments in the final draft of any work product. The attorney contractor may be asked to review documentation, including but not limited to relevant pleadings and briefs from earlier litigation, depositions, actuarial and historical materials, reports, plans, alternative proposals, accounting procedures, historical accounting results, information to beneficiaries, or may be asked to address specific issues and questions. The attorney contractor is expected to offer its own independent analysis and comments strictly from the standpoint of its own practice and experience as a trust attorney.  As required, the contract may be modified, curtailed, or extended, as needed by the OHTA. The attorney contractor will not provide legal advice with regard to the current Cobell v. Norton litigation. DURATION: While the duration of this contract is envisioned to be approximately three years, the actual term will be determined by the attorney contractor's performance, need for private legal expertise, and available funding. LOCATION: It is anticipated that the contractor will be available for periodic meetings at its offices, at the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, or at sites around the United States. Meeting frequency is expected to average about once a month. DIRECTION:  The attorney contractor will work with and be directed by a representative of the Department of the Interior Solicitor, who will also be the contract technical representative for Interior.  All tasking, reporting, and communicating procedures will be established at the start of the contract. TASKS AND DELIVERABLES: Tasks and deliverables on an ongoing basis will include but are not limited to: 1. Meet with Department staff and contractors, as well as personnel from other federal agencies; 2. Assist in evaluating submissions from the Court, from plaintiffs' counsel, or other sources and provide oral or written analysis; 3. Conduct legal research as requested and necessary, and provide independent, expert legal analysis, advice, comments, and recommendations based on the attorney contractor's trust law experience in the form of legal briefs, reports, or letters; 4. Participate in discussions with key OHTA, Departmental, and other contractor personnel on historical accounting, beneficiary relations, and related decisions, policies, procedures, and provide independent expert legal advice and recommendations as appropriate HOW TO PROPOSE: Offers must submit brief written proposals NOT EXCEEDING Fifteen (15) pages in length.

<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>NA The US Army CECOM Acquisition Center Washington intends to procure on behalf of the Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate two Trolley Motion Control systems for the Mine Lanes Facility at Fort Belvoir.  Each trolley will be controlled by a single CPU  system running the Windows 2000 operating system. The PCs will be stationed in the control room which is environmentally controlled.  The system shall meet the following requirements.  A robust PXI (PCI Bus extended for Instrumentation) expansion chassis will be located on the movable platform, housing the necessary motion, vision and data acquisition cards.  The environmental specifications required for the this system are as follows: Temperature and Humidity:  Operating ambient temperature 0 - 55C (32 -  131F), Storage ambient temperature -20 - 70C (-4 - 158F), Operating relative humidity 10 - 90%, non-condensing, Storage relative humidity 5 - 95%, non-condensing, Tested in accordance with IEC-60068-2-1, IEC-60068-2-2, IEC-60068-2-56).  Functional Shoc k: 30 g peak, half sin, 11 ms pulse, Tested in accordance with IEC-60068-2-27, Test profile developed in accordance with MIL-T-28800E.  Random Vibration: Operating 5-500Hz, 0.3 grms, Non-operating 5-500Hz, 2.4 grms,, Tested in accordance with IEC-60068-2-6 4. Non-operating test profile in accordance with MIL-T-28800E and MIL-STD-810E Method 514.  Safety and EMC/EMI Compliance:  Safety EN 61010-1:1993, EMC/EMI CE, C-Tick, and FCC part 15, Electrical Emissions EN 55011 Class A at 10 meters, and FCC part 15 cla ss A above 1 GHz, Electrical Immunity EN 61326:1998, Table 1.  Communication between the PC in the control room and the PXI chassis will take place via a PCI-to-PCI bridge specifically designed for the purpose.  A 1.5 Gb/s serial link over a fiber-optic ca ble will provide seamless integration of the remote PXI bus with the internal PCI bus of the PC.  A high-performance PXI Motion controller card, installed in the remote PXI chassis will be capable of controlling 4 servo motors with digital feedback simulta neously.  Forward limit, reverse limit, home and inhibit controls will be connected for each axis. The motion controller card is capable of controlling the existing Warner Electric Series MX-2000 Servo Motor drives directly using the built-in 16 bit Digita l to Analog Converters that create a -10 to +10V signal.  Encoder feedback can be obtained from the Servo Motors Drives, as is done in the current application. Higher repeatability and accuracy can be obtained by using a magnetic linear encoder, or rotary encoder on each axis. Closer examination of the system is necessary to determine the best solution for each axis.  In addition, uninterrupted power supplies have been selected to provide for continued, reliable operation, and to provide back up power in th e event of a power outage.   A vision system has also been included in the system. The vision system will have a pixel resolution of 640x480.  The Image Acquisition card is compatible with color or monochrome acquisition with NTSC, PAL, S-Video, RS-170 or CCIR inputs.  Point of contact is Stephanie Raho on 703-325-9085, sraho@cacw.army.mil.

<DESC>NA NEUROTOXIN EXPOSURE TREATMENT RESEARCH PROGRAM (NETRP):  The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is soliciting original research proposals, to include but not limited to, studies related to Parkinson?s disease and neurodegenerative processes re sulting from environmental or neurotoxic insults that:   Identify physiologic, pharmacologic, or molecular mechanisms underlying biologic progression of Parkinson?s disease,   Identify mechanisms of co-morbidities of Parkinson?s disease in the central nervous system and other organ systems,    Identify standard compensatory mechanisms resulting from alterations in catecholamine metabolism in Parkinson?s disease and associated functional outcomes,   Identify mechanisms underlying dyskinesia development during traditional therapy,   Identify toxin specific alterations to dopaminergic synaptic plasticity,   Identify specific glial mechanisms in altering dopaminergic neuronal metabolism or function. Strong rationale and novelty are valued in the proposed studies and proposals covering the range of basic to applied science are appropriate.  The intent is not to test new compounds or drugs but rather to provide the mechanistic basis for identifying nove l therapies.  An improved understanding of mechanisms by which basic neurodegenerative processes occur will form the basis of potential preventive measures against the effects of military threat agents and military operational hazards, and also lead to tre atment interventions for Parkinson?s disease.  Proposals will be selected for funding on the basis of scientific quality and military relevance.  Scientific quality is assessed by independent peer review. Projects are typically 2-4 years in duration and mu st be completed by 30 Sep 2006.  Program projects will not be considered.  Approximately $10 M is available for the lifespan of these projects. Proposals must be submitted according to general instructions contained in the Broad Agency Announcement 02-1, http://www-usamraa.army.mil .  Letters of intent containing a proposed title, brief description of project scope (less than 150 words), and inves tigator and institution identification, are encouraged and should be sent by Wednesday, 4 September 2002; these are for planning purposes and investigators will NOT be sent any response to letters of intent.  Full proposals are due by 4:00 pm EST, Wednesda y, 2 October 2002.  Send letters of intent and full proposals to:  Director, U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, ATTN:  MCMR-AAA (Neurotox), 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5014.

<DESC>NA The HQ Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) is soliciting on a full and open basis for a single contractor to provide a commercial solution to MTMC's Surface Transportation Management System (STMS) requirements; integrate that solution in MTMC's IT e nvironment (including software customization for limited Government-unique requirements); implement that integrated capability within MTMC, and operate and maintain the service for MTMC.  The selected contractor will assess the effectiveness of COTS softwa re solutions in meeting new business processes, assist in change management for affected MTMC employees, and assume responsibility for continuing service performance.  Currently, MTMC operates two legacy operates information technology (IT) systems that su pport management of surface transportation operations. The Integrated Booking System (IBS) manages all MTMC point-to-point ocean cargo traffic, and the Global Freight Management (GFM) system manages all other MTMC surface movement traffic (rail, truck, inl and waterway, etc.).  These systems have supported MTMC operations for years, but a recent internal reorganization study (aimed at consolidating resources and focused on core business processes) questioned the need for separate surface movement systems.  M TMC developed these systems internally to help manage unique DoD transportation requirements when surface transportation management focused on modal and regional traffic.  HQ MTMC desires to replace these legacy systems with an integrated surface movement capability, focused on end-to-end transportation management, which handles all modes of surface traffic.  The anticipated period of performance is November 1, 2002 through October 31, 2007.  This effort will be awarded as a five year Fixed-Price Labor Hour s Award Term Incentive contract consisting of a one base year and four one-year options.  In order to incentivize contract performance, the successful contractor will have the opportunity to earn up to five additional years of performance.

<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This Federal Business Opportunities, (FedBizOpps)) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed contract award to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  ESC/SRK intends to award a contract during September 2002 to provide continued Technical, Engineering, Analysis, and Management Support to ESC/SRG in support of Video Processing Capability (VPC) and to develop and field additional Video Processing Capability (VPC) systems.  Video Processing Capability (VPC) is a NIMA standards compliant transit-cased digital video system.   VPC currently receives and re-transmits the Predator feed to Distributed Common Ground (DCGS) Systems for various TPED functions. VPC also has the ability to archive, edit and disseminate digital motion imagery.   SAIC is currently performing these functions under Contract No. F19628-97-D-0014, CIGSS Technical Support (CTS) contract.   The government requirement to procure and field additional VPC systems cannot be completed under the existing contract due to the lack of sufficient time and ceiling constraints. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B),"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case the USAF may deem services to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C.  2304(d)(1)(B)).  During performance of the CTS contract, SAIC has continued to acquire a significant amount of knowledge of and expertise in the VPC program.  Significant negative impact to the VPC program would result if the supplies/services were not continued.  Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of non-reoccurring engineering costs and significant delays and disruption of work.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.   An Acquisition Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection.  ESC's Acquisition Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph P.  Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, ESC/CO, (781) 377-5106 or email at joseph.maryeski@hanscom.af.mil.   Call Kathleen N.  Cohen at (781) 377-5584 or email at kathleen.cohen@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.   See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Navy is undertaking development of a new form of ship-based infrared horizon search system using a set of eight staring focal plane arrays.  Azimuthal field of view is far more important then elevation field of view, so for this application the Navy needs rectangular rather than square format arrays, and an evaluation criterion for proposals will be assurance of ability within three years of producing 2560x512 size arrays.  The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement, under full and open competition, for three packaged and remotely operable mid-wave arrays with standard 25 ?m square pitch but with a rectangular array shape of 2048x512 detectors capable of operating with F2.5 optics in temperature backgrounds ranging from freezing to 115F.  Repair of any part of the packaged arrays, including but not limited to electronics, dewar vacuum or replacing the array inside the dewar should it degrade or peal, will also be part of the contract.  An option will be included for one or two of these arrays to be mated to a fully operational and multiplexed 2560x512 silicon readout chip in an appropriate dewar. A detailed specification will be issued with the solicitation.  This work will be unclassified.  This is not a follow-on procurement. Advance versions of key sections for comment may be available prior to release of the RFP.  If interested, contact the contract specialist by email. The same advance versions will be provided to all such requesters by e-mail, and formal questions of general interest will be addressed by amendment of the RFP.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the solicitation is issued.  Numbered Note 26 applies.

<CONTACT>SANDRA V. SAVAGE, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513/487-2046, E-Mail: SAVAGE.SANDRA@EPA.GOV
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SRI International, Menlo CA, for the development of laser methods of quantifying air toxics under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement for the ORD/NRMRL/APPCD at RTP, NC, includes testing, designing, fabricating, validating and delivering requisite systems.  The requirement is for performance testing of a two-color, Jet REMPI system which is unique in that it must include the ability to rapidly switch between the detection of multiple compounds without operator intervention or adjustment and it must be tested and calibrated using multiple highly chlorinated dioxin and furan congers. Additionally, it must be designed to allow for rapid replacement of components with limited operational lifetimes and provide an easy means of exchanging ion extraction optics and pulsed gas valve.  The U.S. EPA believes that only SRI International is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement as it has worked extensively in this area since 1985 and is the only domestic organization currently applying jet-REMPI to the detection of highly chlorinated dioxins and furans.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.   A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-4142.  TREATMENT FOR DISPOSITION OF INEEL MIXED LOW-LEVEL WASTE. Contact Mr. James A. Alberico.  BBWI, a managing and operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is seeking an expression of interest from firms to provide innovative solutions for treatment and disposal of multiple INEEL mixed low-level waste (MLLW) streams. Treatment facilities must be privately owned and operated outside of areas managed by DOE and must have a mechanism for disposal of the final waste forms.  Appropriate licenses and permits obtained at vendor expense must be in place prior to award of the contract(s).  Contract(s) may contain incentives to meet aggressive schedules.  The amount of waste for which treatment is sought under this announcement is approximately 1950 cubic meters to be treated in the October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2004 period. The mixed wastes to be treated include soils, sludges, liquids, debris, and particulate material.  These wastes may carry a multitude of EPA waste codes and/or are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and have unique chemical and physical properties.  Each waste stream may require different handling, transfer, blending, processing, and treatment.  The wastes have been grouped based on EPA waste code, PCBs, physical and chemical properties, and/or potential known treatment process(es) to meet disposal standards.  The treatment groups and estimated two-year waste volumes include stabilization (120 m3), macroencapsulation (1810 m3), thermal/non-thermal treatment for organics (5 m3), PCB treatment (10 m3), and mercury treatment (5m3). Additionally, some of the waste streams requiring stabilization are contaminated with dioxins and furans ranging from 0 to 300 parts per billion and require treatment to below 1 part per billion. The radioactive component of the subject waste is classified as low-level radioactive material.  The radioactive component is not classified as transuranic (i.e., alpha emitting radionuclides with an atomic number greater than 92, half life greater than 20 years, in concentrations greater than 100 nanocuries per gram) or high level waste.  Services to be contracted include both on-site and off-site activities.  On-site activities include establishing subcontract personnel at the INEEL to facilitate characterization and waste acceptance activities.  The subcontractor would assume custody of the waste at the INEEL and be responsible for shipping to the treatment facilities. Off-site activities include performing any necessary sorting, sizing, and additional detailed characterization of waste required prior to treatment, processing the waste to meet applicable regulatory standards and requirements, any interim storage at the treatment facility, and transport and disposal of the treated product and any residuals in a permitted and licensed facility.  The treated waste must meet all regulatory and other applicable requirements for disposal.  Development of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and treatment/disposal of waste under the contract(s) will be contingent on availability of necessary funding.  The RFP, if developed, will include detailed waste stream information.  Qualified respondents must provide two printed copies of the following information: company name, address, point of contact, email, phone/fax numbers, and a concise summary report that describes the capabilities of the respondent and a listing of all similar recent activities complete with reference names and telephone numbers, and copies of licenses and permits held including NRC and agreement state licenses for radioactive materials, and RCRA permits.  Respondents who provide insufficient information will not be considered further.  The expression of interest is totally separate from all other solicitations involving facilities or services for the treatment of INEEL MLLW.  Firms interested in responding should forward the requisite information to:  Mr. James A. Alberico, Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, P.O. Box 1625, Mail Stop 4142, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-4142.  Responses by email, fax or telephone will be considered nonresponsive.  This solicitation will close on July 1, 2002

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intend to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to B. Erard & Associates, 2350 Swaps Court, Reston, VA, for development of an alternative tax scoring methodology.  The IRS has relied on a discriminant analysis ("DIF") methodology to guide workload selection.  This methodology employs examination data concerning the likelihood of a substantial assessment to develop a prediction formula that effectively discriminates between returns with substantial audit potential and returns with little or no potential.  Under a previous requirement, B. Erard & Associates developed an alternative workload selection methodology that differs from the DIF approach in several respects.  Under this requirement, B. Erard & Associates will undertake a study to refine its previous methodology, both to improve its performance and to facilitate its evaluation vis-a-vis the current IRS methodology; refine its methodology for variable selection with special attention to three areas; Refine its specification of explanatory variables and apply its workload selection methodology to Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP) data pertaining to two selected examination classes from one tax year.  All responsible sources who can provide the above requirement shall submit written capability no later than 15 days from posted date of this announcement.  Contractor submitting a response should demonstrate the following qualifications: (1) a working knowledge of TCMP and AIMS data; (2) extensive experience in tax compliance studies, especially involving the evaluation of workload selection; and (3) a well-established track record in econometric analysis techniques.  All responses shall include FOB point; a POC (name and telephone number); GSA contract number if applicable; and business size.  Responses over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.

<SUBJECT>D -- Development and Production of the Judiciary Salary Plan (JSP) and Court Personnel System (CPS) Pay Tables
<SOLNBR>USCA-02-R-0047
<RESPDATE>070502
<ARCHDATE>07202002
<CONTACT>Peter Bouker, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-502-2317, Fax 202-502-1066, Email peter_bouker@ao.uscourts.gov
<DESC>The Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) requires a contractor to support the development and production of the Judiciary Salary Plan (JSP) and Court Personnel System (CPS) pay tables.  The JSP and CPS pay tables are salary charts that list rates of pay.  These rates of pay are based on a number of variables including grade or Classification Level (CL), salary step, occupational specialty, and locality.  There are approximately 145 pay tables currently in use with many individual pay tables having as many as 732 salaries.

	The JSP and CPS pay tables are effective beginning the first day of the new pay period each January.  In order to meet this effective date for salary adjustments, the Human Resources Division (HRD) requires drafts of each of the updated pay tables by the first Monday in December, and the final hard copy of the updated pay tables by the third Monday in December, so that employees responsible for program applications and for payroll processing can enter the new rates of pay into the system.  Each of the updated pay tables must be 100 percent accurate.

	The contract will consist of two distinct elements.  First, is the annual requirement for the development and production of the pay tables on a fixed-price basis for the next calendar year with four additional one year options.  Second, is the requirement to update/maintain the pay tables on an ad hoc basis in response to negotiated, fixed-price task orders.

	Contractor services in support of the annual development and production of the JSP and CPS pay tables include the following: a. updating the various JSP and CPS pay tables, including the basic pay tables, the special rate pay tables, the law enforcement officer pay tables, the locality pay tables, and miscellaneous pay tables; b. increasing the salaries of the various pay tables according to complex and detailed instructions provided by the AO; c. comparing the salaries of each special rate pay table with the salaries of the locality pay table for its locality and "merging" the pay tables, resulting in a new ["merged"] pay table that contains the higher of the two salaries that were compared at each of the corresponding grades, or CLs, and steps; and d. insuring that the appropriate salary caps are maintained in developing locality pay tables.

	Contractor services in support of the ad hoc development and production of the 2002 JSP and CPS pay tables will be accomplished through the issuance of fixed-price negotiated task orders.  The solicitation will include the first such task requirements which involves making modifications to the 2002 JSP and CPS pay tables as follows: a. adjusting the structural foundation of the existing JSP and CPS pay tables to ensure that lines of grades or classification levels can be easily deleted during pay tables production; b. modifying the existing Court Reporters Pay Table with the addition of two columns to reflect newly approved court reporters' pay levels; and, c. reordering of the tables in the book and modifying the corresponding page numbering in the index.
   
	Contract award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the judiciary.  Evaluation factors are: 1. Contractor Methodology - the methodology it will employ to satisfy the requirements of the contract; 2.  Experience in Performing Related Work -  past experience in performing work similar to the type of work identified in the statement of work;   3.  Past Performance References - a description of no more than five of its previous Federal Government or Commercial projects/contracts which have been performed during the past five (5) years (from date of proposal submission) and relevant to the services required in the Statement of Work; and 4.  Price.

	Interested parties should send an email request for the solicitation to peter_bouker@ao.uscourts.gov, a fax to Peter Bouker at (202) 502-1066, or a letter to Peter G. Bouker, Contracting Officer, Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, OIS/PMD/ACB, Suite 3-250, 1 Columbus Circle, NE, Washington, D.C. 20544.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-20. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (OCT 2000); 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (APR 1998), with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (AUG 2000). Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-85256; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract for consultation, review and recommendations for the design of the MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program) Option Value Model. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) by virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, the Submerged Lands Act, and pursuant to delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Interior has jurisdiction over leasing and development of OCS submerged lands and mineral development. In conjunction with this jurisdiction, the MMS is required to follow the overall Mineral Management goals as stated in the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978.   Related to the MMS's responsibilities under the OCS Lands Act is staff analysis of environmental and resource information in conjunction with OCS oil and gas lease sales. In particular, the bid adequacy analysis for the high bids received at blocks offered for lease attempts to ensure that the Federal Government receives fair market value for those blocks. A procedure for reviewing bids and determining whether they are adequate has been developed by MMS.  To assist in placing values on these blocks, computer models are used. The proprietary computer program used by MMS in the determination of the fair market value of a block is called MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program). The mathematical methodology and statistical approach by the model is critical to ensure the correct fair market value assessment.  MMS is preparing an optimization model that would be teamed in some way with MONTCAR. 	The optimization model that we have in view is often termed "real option valuation."  Option Value (OV) is the result of optimization of uncertain net present value (NPV) over time.  In calculating option value, the timing of activities is flexible and is variable within the optimizing model, instead of being assumed in terms of a fixed scenario. MMS expects to accomplish this work by the following steps:  1) MMS staff members prepare a requirement's document, design plan, and a model prototype;  2) The requirements document, plan, and prototype is critically reviewed by a consultant under this contract with constructive recommendations;  3) The consultant's comments are reviewed, and, if agreed to, implemented by MMS staff.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain consultation, review, and recommendations for the design of the Option Value Model and its interface with MONTCAR. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT:  The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of twelve (12) months and a cost of $30,000.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor shall (1) attend a kick-off meeting at MMS headquarters in Herndon, Virginia within 1 month of the award where the contract requirements and detailed statement of work will be reviewed in detail.  The contractor shall prepare a written summary of discussion and agreements reached in the kick-off meeting within 30 days of the meeting. (2) The Contractor will critically review MMS' design plan, prototype OV model, and strategy for model development.  The Contractor will provide constructive recommendations for modifying current plans and OV model, including discussion and recommendations for the technical issues raised. The extent of Contractor's review,  discussions, consultation and recommendations will include: (a)  review of research literature as applied to basic option models of oil leases, emphasizing the latest literature, including a bibliography;  (b) explain the pros and cons of alternative numerical techniques including binomial tree, Monte Carlo and finite difference techniques as they might be applied to the MONTCAR OV model; recommendation regarding the single vs. compound option approach relating to decisions to explore and/or develop the lease; (c) explain the principal variants of the Brownian Motion (BM) and Mean-Reverting (MR) model processes and cover detailed topics to encompass modeling prices in levels or in logs including a deterministic trend term or not, the statistical techniques that would be used to determine the model parameters, then recommend a price process to use in the OV MONTCAR model;  (d) discus price models explaining how to estimate volatility and compute probabilities for the recommended price model and solution technique; (e)  discuss various time step assumptions necessary for lead time on development; (f) discuss the discount rate issue for the calculation of OV and explain principal alternative ways of reflecting  unhedged risk and the developer's risk preference in the OV model, then recommend a discount rate concept and explain how it is estimated from cost of capital data or the like;  (g) discuss convenience yield, how it is estimated and recommend how to treat it in the OV model; (h) discuss practical implementation of prices before and after investment; (i) explain in detail how the recommended OV model links with MONTCAR and give a numerical illustration;  (j) discuss how a single mean price path might be substituted in place of multiple possible price paths from the time of development onwards eliminating unnecessary computations and how they would or would not match up with existing MONTCAR price representations; (k) make recommendations as to specific information needed from MONTCAR runs so that additions and changes to existing models can be programmed by MMS staff members. (3) The Contractor, after completing the investigation of technical topics and finishing the review of the MMS design and prototype,  will draft a final written report giving the findings and recommendations and make an oral presentation with MMS staff at MMS' headquarters to discuss the recommendations.  (4)  The Contractor will revise the draft paper to include material introduced in the oral discussion and transmit the final written report to MMS within one month of the final meeting.   HOW TO RESPOND: Offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement, a Technical Proposal and a firm fixed price.  CAPABILITIES STATEMENT:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel  and organizational experience and facilities in simulation, oil and gas property evaluation, real options, and computer programming; and (2) past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization is currently performing or has completed  within the last three years.  References will be checked.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  detail how you plan to approach the project and tasks;  include a time schedule indicating benchmarks;  specify key personnel, their specific functions and reporting relationships. Indicate who will be the primary point of contact for this project.  COST PROPOSAL:  this will be a firm fixed price type contract.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  the following factors are considered more important than price: (1) Contract Perception:  overall comprehension of project needs and plan of execution; opportunity for MMS interaction and incorporation of comments. (2) Experience:  Program Manager's experience with similar offshore oil and gas modeling projects; quality of experience as demonstrated with recent offshore oil and gas simulation and quantitative statistical modeling; demonstrated experience in real options; quality of experience with C++ as demonstrated with a recent review and explanation of the design, methodology, and algorithms of computer models written using this language; and verbal and writing skills of key personnel in the preparation of oral presentations and written reports dealing with technical and statistical subject areas.   (3) Organization's Personnel: currency of personnel working on similar offshore oil and gas modeling projects; depth of experience working on projects relating to offshore oil and gas property acquisition, incorporation of real option financial modeling into oil and gas property value determination, statistics, simulation, systems analysis and computer programming; education and training in post-graduate mathematics, statistics, and computer programming; (4)  Past Performance:  ability to timely complete projects, adhere to schedules and budgets, produce quality products delivered, and cooperation between key personnel and the client. Between proposals that are evaluated as substantially equal in quality, the price to the Government will be a major factor in selection for an award. The Government may not conduct negotiations so submit your best offer. Contract award shall be to the responsible Offeror, whose acceptable offer, conforming to this RFP, is most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Office of Historical Trust Accounting, U.S. Department of the Interior. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; OFFERS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Contract period is for a base period of one year with two option years. The Government reserves the right to unilaterally extend the period of contract performance in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract--Services". STATEMENT OF WORK: Objective: Long-term support, analysis, and expert legal advice provided to the Office of Historical Trust Accounting and Departmental leadership for the historical accounting on law and practice related to common law trust beneficiaries and private and commercial trustees. BACKGROUND: The Department of the Interior (Department) has the fiduciary responsibility on behalf of the U.S. Government to manage both Tribal trust  funds and Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust funds. These two trust funds and accounts are managed by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST). The Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) was established on July 10, 2001, to plan for and direct the historical accounting of IIM accounts.  The OHTA is developing a Plan for the Historical Accounting (Plan) which must be presented to and approved by the Congress to secure long-term funding, and to the District Court in relation to the Cobell v. Norton litigation (see below).  In creating the OHTA, Interior Secretary Gale Norton set a first charge to prepare an initial plan for what must be addressed in the Plan. This initial plan submitted September 10, 2001, the Blueprint for Developing the Comprehensive Historical Accounting Plan for the Individual Indian Money Accounts, is the framework for preparing the Plan.  The Secretary's second charge was to develop a plan for initial work that can begin before the  is completed.  The OHTA submitted on November 7, 2001, the Report Identifying Preliminary Work for the Historical Accounting.  (Both documents are available on the OHTA website at www.doi.gov/ohta/). The OST, established by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (PL. 103?412), was created to improve the accountability and management of Indian funds held in trust by the Federal Government. Currently, OST maintains approximately 1,400 accounts for 315 Tribal entities with cash and investments of approximately $3.0 billion, and more than 285,000 IIM accounts with cash and investments of approximately $360 million. Annually, approximately $800 million passes through the Tribal trust fund, and approximately $300 million passes through the IIM trust fund. This income is generated from the sale or rental of Indian-owned land and natural resources such as timber, farming, grazing, and royalties from various minerals and oil and  gas exploration and production, and from land use for rights-of-way and easements.  Funds also are derived from interest earned on invested funds, as well as awards or settlements of Tribal or individual Indian claims.  The BIA, along with the Department's Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management, manage the land records, and revenue collection and processing. COBELL V. NORTON: The facts underlying the Cobell v. Norton litigation involve a broad sweep of United States history. Although U.S. policy through the 1870s was to locate Indians on reservations, the government began to break up reservations starting in the 1880s. Thousands of individual Indians were allotted 60- to 120-acre parcels of land in the break-up. The government held these parcels in trust, and established an Individual Indian Monies Trust Fund to collect and disburse to the Indians any revenues generated by mining, oil and gas extraction, timber operations, grazing or similar activities on their land. In June 1996, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Department by five Indian plaintiffs on behalf of Individual Indian Money (IIM) account holders which asked for, in part, the historical accounting of IIM accounts.  The case was divided into two phases: the first phase addressed the Department's efforts to reform the management of IIM trust funds, and the timing and scope of any second phase relating to actual accounting issues is not known at this time. Trial was held during June and July 1999 on the first phase of the complaint.  On December 21, 1999, the U.S. District Court ruled that the Department was in breach of four specific duties.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the ruling of the District Court; however, it stated that the actual legal breach was the failure to provide an accounting. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling provides some guidance on the obligation of the Department to perform an accounting of the IIM accounts. Specifically, the Court of Appeals held that the relationship between the United States and the IIM account holders is a trust relationship that creates fiduciary obligations.  See Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1099-1100 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In addition, the Court of Appeals held that, while the government's obligations are rooted in and outlined by relevant statutes and treaties, they are largely defined in traditional equitable terms: "Where Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity or the common law, a court must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms."  Courts "must infer that Congress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties unless Congress has unequivocally expressed an intent to the contrary." Id. Much as the Supreme Court has regularly turned to the Restatement and other authorities to construe trust responsibilities, it is appropriate for the District Court to consult similar sources. Because of this, the Court of Appeals held that the United States owes a duty to account to the IIM beneficiaries. The Court of Appeals also held that the "1994 Act reaffirms the government's preexisting fiduciary duty to perform a complete historical accounting of trust fund assets," and found that the fair and accurate accounting referenced in Section 102 of the 1994 Act requires "reconciling the accounts, taking into account past deposits, withdrawals, and accruals," as well as reporting of "all items of property, income, and expenses. . . ." Id. at 1102-03.  The Court of Appeals further stated that an "adequate" accounting is one that is "sufficient to serve the purposes for which a trust accounting is typically conducted."  Id. at 1103.  Therefore, the accounting "must contain sufficient information for the beneficiary readily to ascertain whether the trust has been faithfully carried out." Id. The Court of Appeals, however, acknowledged that there were substantial questions yet to be determined about the scope of the accounting owed by the United States.  The Court of Appeals expressly stated that the decisions regarding the nature and scope of the United States' accounting were to be resolved by the Federal Government.  Thus, while noting that the Department's actions would be judged by strict standards based upon the duty to deal fairly with the IIM beneficiaries, the Court of Appeals noted with approval that the District Court had "explicitly left open the choice of how the accounting would be conducted, whether certain accounting methods, such as statistical sampling or something else, would be appropriate.  Such decisions are properly left in the hands of administrative agencies."  Id. at 1104. It is within this context that the Department is designing its approach and will conduct the historical accounting using appropriate methods to fulfill its trust responsibility. HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING PROJECT: As part of the Department's overall trust reform efforts, the Department is undertaking an evaluation of the reliability of past IIM account activity. Part of this work is already underway for the period after enactment of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. That work will not, however, discharge the Department's duty to account as outlined by the two courts. The mission of OHTA is to determine what will be required to meet the Department's duty to account, present the Plan for the work to Congress (and the Court), and upon appropriation of funds needed, implement the accounting. Given the length of time involved, the distinct histories of various groups of trust assets, the various business practices that generated trust income, known or suspected problems in the records, and other historical factors, the development of the Plan for the historical accounting is a complicated task.  Among the things that must be evaluated are the relative costs, utilities, and impact upon beneficiaries of various approaches to providing the accounting for distinct subgroups of accounts or trust assets. The Plan for the accounting must be both fair to beneficiaries and feasible. Based on information developed through public meetings and from related efforts, including substantial work in relation to production of records for the five named plaintiffs, reconciliation of the five named plaintiffs' accounts, additional research and progress toward the historical accounting, and related trust reform efforts, the Department is developing a Plan, as requested by Congress in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations report language, describing in detail how the Department will conduct the historical accounting, the methods to be employed, the anticipated costs, and anticipated levels of confidence and accuracy in the results.   In her Secretarial Order and memorandum of July 10, 2001, Secretary Gale Norton established the OHTA and charged the OHTA with planning and carrying out this historical accounting. NATURE OF THE CONTRACT: This contract is intended to provide the OHTA and the Department with independent expertise in trust and fiduciary law from the perspective of providing trust services to beneficiaries in a private or commercial trust relationship. Generally, the selected attorney contractor will consult with Office of Historical Trust Accounting and Office of the Solicitor staff on an ongoing basis.  The attorney contractor will be asked to review materials provided by the OHTA through the Solicitor's Office and prepare legal memoranda which respond to legal issues presented in the implementation of the historical accounting plan, conducting the accounting, and reporting to beneficiaries. The attorney contractor's work products will be circulated to government staff and/or other government contractors for review and comment, and the attorney contractor may be asked to address such comments in the final draft of any work product. The attorney contractor may be asked to review documentation, including but not limited to relevant pleadings and briefs from earlier litigation, depositions, actuarial and historical materials, reports, plans, alternative proposals, accounting procedures, historical accounting results, information to beneficiaries, or may be asked to address specific issues and questions. The attorney contractor is expected to offer its own independent analysis and comments strictly from the standpoint of its own practice and experience as a trust attorney.  As required, the contract may be modified, curtailed, or extended, as needed by the OHTA. The attorney contractor will not provide legal advice with regard to the current Cobell v. Norton litigation. DURATION: While the duration of this contract is envisioned to be approximately three years, the actual term will be determined by the attorney contractor's performance, need for private legal expertise, and available funding. LOCATION: It is anticipated that the contractor will be available for periodic meetings at its offices, at the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, or at sites around the United States. Meeting frequency is expected to average about once a month. DIRECTION:  The attorney contractor will work with and be directed by a representative of the Department of the Interior Solicitor, who will also be the contract technical representative for Interior.  All tasking, reporting, and communicating procedures will be established at the start of the contract. TASKS AND DELIVERABLES: Tasks and deliverables on an ongoing basis will include but are not limited to: 1. Meet with Department staff and contractors, as well as personnel from other federal agencies; 2. Assist in evaluating submissions from the Court, from plaintiffs' counsel, or other sources and provide oral or written analysis; 3. Conduct legal research as requested and necessary, and provide independent, expert legal analysis, advice, comments, and recommendations based on the attorney contractor's trust law experience in the form of legal briefs, reports, or letters; 4. Participate in discussions with key OHTA, Departmental, and other contractor personnel on historical accounting, beneficiary relations, and related decisions, policies, procedures, and provide independent expert legal advice and recommendations as appropriate HOW TO PROPOSE: Offers must submit brief written proposals NOT EXCEEDING Fifteen (15) pages in length. The proposal shall detail the methodology by which the offer will meet our needs and demonstrate the relevant experience of the company and its key personnel. Resumes must accompany the proposal but do not count against the 15 page limit.

Offers must also submit a business proposal priced on a time-and-material basis. The proposal should be priced by task showing the position; loaded hourly rate; number of hours; and an estimate of other direct costs such as travel. EVALUATION CRITERIA: 1) Experience in law and practice related to common law trust beneficiaries and private and commercial trustees; 2) past performance in such law and practice; 3) technical approach; and 4) price. This is a best value procurement which favors technical competence over price. Experience and past performance are the most important evaluation factors with technical approach of secondary importance.

<DESC>NA The US Army CECOM Acquisition Center Washington intends to procure on behalf of the Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate two Trolley Motion Control systems for the Mine Lanes Facility at Fort Belvoir.  Each trolley will be controlled by a single CPU  system running the Windows 2000 operating system. The PCs will be stationed in the control room which is environmentally controlled.  The system shall meet the following requirements.  A robust PXI (PCI Bus extended for Instrumentation) expansion chassis will be located on the movable platform, housing the necessary motion, vision and data acquisition cards.  The environmental specifications required for the this system are as follows: Temperature and Humidity:  Operating ambient temperature 0 - 55C (32 -  131F), Storage ambient temperature -20 - 70C (-4 - 158F), Operating relative humidity 10 - 90%, non-condensing, Storage relative humidity 5 - 95%, non-condensing, Tested in accordance with IEC-60068-2-1, IEC-60068-2-2, IEC-60068-2-56).  Functional Shoc k: 30 g peak, half sin, 11 ms pulse, Tested in accordance with IEC-60068-2-27, Test profile developed in accordance with MIL-T-28800E.  Random Vibration: Operating 5-500Hz, 0.3 grms, Non-operating 5-500Hz, 2.4 grms,, Tested in accordance with IEC-60068-2-6 4. Non-operating test profile in accordance with MIL-T-28800E and MIL-STD-810E Method 514.  Safety and EMC/EMI Compliance:  Safety EN 61010-1:1993, EMC/EMI CE, C-Tick, and FCC part 15, Electrical Emissions EN 55011 Class A at 10 meters, and FCC part 15 cla ss A above 1 GHz, Electrical Immunity EN 61326:1998, Table 1.  Communication between the PC in the control room and the PXI chassis will take place via a PCI-to-PCI bridge specifically designed for the purpose.  A 1.5 Gb/s serial link over a fiber-optic ca ble will provide seamless integration of the remote PXI bus with the internal PCI bus of the PC.  A high-performance PXI Motion controller card, installed in the remote PXI chassis will be capable of controlling 4 servo motors with digital feedback simulta neously.  Forward limit, reverse limit, home and inhibit controls will be connected for each axis. The motion controller card is capable of controlling the existing Warner Electric Series MX-2000 Servo Motor drives directly using the built-in 16 bit Digita l to Analog Converters that create a -10 to +10V signal.  Encoder feedback can be obtained from the Servo Motors Drives, as is done in the current application. Higher repeatability and accuracy can be obtained by using a magnetic linear encoder, or rotary encoder on each axis. Closer examination of the system is necessary to determine the best solution for each axis.  In addition, uninterrupted power supplies have been selected to provide for continued, reliable operation, and to provide back up power in th e event of a power outage.   A vision system has also been included in the system. The vision system will have a pixel resolution of 640x480.  The Image Acquisition card is compatible with color or monochrome acquisition with NTSC, PAL, S-Video, RS-170 or CCIR inputs.  Point of contact is Stephanie Raho on 703-325-9085, sraho@cacw.army.mil.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-20. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (OCT 2000); 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (APR 1998), with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (AUG 2000). Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-85256; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract for consultation, review and recommendations for the design of the MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program) Option Value Model. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) by virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, the Submerged Lands Act, and pursuant to delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Interior has jurisdiction over leasing and development of OCS submerged lands and mineral development. In conjunction with this jurisdiction, the MMS is required to follow the overall Mineral Management goals as stated in the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978.   Related to the MMS's responsibilities under the OCS Lands Act is staff analysis of environmental and resource information in conjunction with OCS oil and gas lease sales. In particular, the bid adequacy analysis for the high bids received at blocks offered for lease attempts to ensure that the Federal Government receives fair market value for those blocks. A procedure for reviewing bids and determining whether they are adequate has been developed by MMS.  To assist in placing values on these blocks, computer models are used. The proprietary computer program used by MMS in the determination of the fair market value of a block is called MONTCAR (Monte Carlo Simulation Program). The mathematical methodology and statistical approach by the model is critical to ensure the correct fair market value assessment.  MMS is preparing an optimization model that would be teamed in some way with MONTCAR. 	The optimization model that we have in view is often termed "real option valuation."  Option Value (OV) is the result of optimization of uncertain net present value (NPV) over time.  In calculating option value, the timing of activities is flexible and is variable within the optimizing model, instead of being assumed in terms of a fixed scenario. MMS expects to accomplish this work by the following steps:  1) MMS staff members prepare a requirement's document, design plan, and a model prototype;  2) The requirements document, plan, and prototype is critically reviewed by a consultant under this contract with constructive recommendations;  3) The consultant's comments are reviewed, and, if agreed to, implemented by MMS staff.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain consultation, review, and recommendations for the design of the Option Value Model and its interface with MONTCAR. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT:  The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of twelve (12) months and a cost of $30,000.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor shall (1) attend a kick-off meeting at MMS headquarters in Herndon, Virginia within 1 month of the award where the contract requirements and detailed statement of work will be reviewed in detail.  The contractor shall prepare a written summary of discussion and agreements reached in the kick-off meeting within 30 days of the meeting. (2) The Contractor will critically review MMS' design plan, prototype OV model, and strategy for model development.  The Contractor will provide constructive recommendations for modifying current plans and OV model, including discussion and recommendations for the technical issues raised. The extent of Contractor's review,  discussions, consultation and recommendations will include: (a)  review of research literature as applied to basic option models of oil leases, emphasizing the latest literature, including a bibliography;  (b) explain the pros and cons of alternative numerical techniques including binomial tree, Monte Carlo and finite difference techniques as they might be applied to the MONTCAR OV model; recommendation regarding the single vs. compound option approach relating to decisions to explore and/or develop the lease; (c) explain the principal variants of the Brownian Motion (BM) and Mean-Reverting (MR) model processes and cover detailed topics to encompass modeling prices in levels or in logs including a deterministic trend term or not, the statistical techniques that would be used to determine the model parameters, then recommend a price process to use in the OV MONTCAR model;  (d) discus price models explaining how to estimate volatility and compute probabilities for the recommended price model and solution technique; (e)  discuss various time step assumptions necessary for lead time on development; (f) discuss the discount rate issue for the calculation of OV and explain principal alternative ways of reflecting  unhedged risk and the developer's risk preference in the OV model, then recommend a discount rate concept and explain how it is estimated from cost of capital data or the like;  (g) discuss convenience yield, how it is estimated and recommend how to treat it in the OV model; (h) discuss practical implementation of prices before and after investment; (i) explain in detail how the recommended OV model links with MONTCAR and give a numerical illustration;  (j) discuss how a single mean price path might be substituted in place of multiple possible price paths from the time of development onwards eliminating unnecessary computations and how they would or would not match up with existing MONTCAR price representations; (k) make recommendations as to specific information needed from MONTCAR runs so that additions and changes to existing models can be programmed by MMS staff members. (3) The Contractor, after completing the investigation of technical topics and finishing the review of the MMS design and prototype,  will draft a final written report giving the findings and recommendations and make an oral presentation with MMS staff at MMS' headquarters to discuss the recommendations.  (4)  The Contractor will revise the draft paper to include material introduced in the oral discussion and transmit the final written report to MMS within one month of the final meeting.   HOW TO RESPOND: Offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement, a Technical Proposal and a firm fixed price.  CAPABILITIES STATEMENT:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel  and organizational experience and facilities in simulation, oil and gas property evaluation, real options, and computer programming; and (2) past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization is currently performing or has completed  within the last three years.  References will be checked.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  detail how you plan to approach the project and tasks;  include a time schedule indicating benchmarks;  specify key personnel, their specific functions and reporting relationships. Indicate who will be the primary point of contact for this project.  COST PROPOSAL:  this will be a firm fixed price type contract.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  the following factors are considered more important than price: (1) Contract Perception:  overall comprehension of project needs and plan of execution; opportunity for MMS interaction and incorporation of comments. (2) Experience:  Program Manager's experience with similar offshore oil and gas modeling projects; quality of experience as demonstrated with recent offshore oil and gas simulation and quantitative statistical modeling; demonstrated experience in real options; quality of experience with C++ as demonstrated with a recent review and explanation of the design, methodology, and algorithms of computer models written using this language; and verbal and writing skills of key personnel in the preparation of oral presentations and written reports dealing with technical and statistical subject areas.   (3) Organization's Personnel: currency of personnel working on similar offshore oil and gas modeling projects; depth of experience working on projects relating to offshore oil and gas property acquisition, incorporation of real option financial modeling into oil and gas property value determination, statistics, simulation, systems analysis and computer programming; education and training in post-graduate mathematics, statistics, and computer programming; (4)  Past Performance:  ability to timely complete projects, adhere to schedules and budgets, produce quality products delivered, and cooperation between key personnel and the client. Between proposals that are evaluated as substantially equal in quality, the price to the Government will be a major factor in selection for an award. The Government may not conduct negotiations so submit your best offer. Contract award shall be to the responsible Offeror, whose acceptable offer, conforming to this RFP, is most advantageous to the Government.
