This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: Rotary Coupler.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has a requirement for Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR)-9 Rotary Couplers to be used in the ASR-11 radar system.  Currently only Continental Microwave and Tool Company model number 1639, NSN 5985-01-313-7839 is qualified as a replacement for the ASR-11 rotary coupler.  The FAA is interested in qualifying an additional source(s).

The rotary couplers are used in FAA radar systems and are critical to Air Traffic Control in maintaining safety in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The rotary coupler is a single point of failure for every radar system.  In the event of rotary coupler failure, there are no back-up systems in place.  Therefore the quality and projected life cycle of the rotary couplers is vital to the continued support of the NAS.  

The requirement will be for one base year period with four one-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  It is anticipated that multiple contracts will be awarded to meet this requirement.

Continental Microwave and Tool model number 1639 required more than two (2) years to qualify as a substitute for the ASR-11 rotary coupler.  It is anticipated that the qualification of an alternate rotary coupler will also require a minimum of two (2) years.  

To meet existing requirements, it is anticipated that a quantity of 20 model 1639 rotary couplers will be purchased from Continental Microwave and Tool while a second rotary coupler is being tested for qualification in both the ASR-9 and ASR-11 radar systems.  

Cobham Defense Electronic Systems, Kevlin Division is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the rotary couplers and holds the proprietary rights to the technical documentation.  Therefore, the FAA does not have any specifications or drawings available for release.    

The intent of this market survey is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to provide Form-Fit-Function rotary couplers to the model 1639 an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT: 

Qualified vendors are invited to submit documentation evidencing the possession of the following capabilities:

1. Demonstration of experience involving manufacture and testing of rotary couplers of equal complexity or greater to the Continental Microwave and Tool model 1639.
2. Demonstration of possession of the proper National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibrated test equipment to verify compliance to the FAA's Certificates of Compliance and Measurement Set documents for the rotary coupler
3. Demonstration of the capacity to handle the projected workload and make delivery to the FAA within 180 days after the receipt of an order.
5. Demonstration of the capability to warranty each rotary coupler for a period of five (5) years after installation in a radar site.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSE TO MARKET SURVEY:
In order to be considered responsive, organizations expressing interest in this matter must provide the following:
a. Capability Statement (as defined above)
b. Completed Business Declaration Form

Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.

Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to: Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey: Rotary Coupler Repair, to arrive by 2:00 p.m. CST, January 29, 2015.  

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received within ten days of this posting. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 6.1 FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. This procurement will use the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government. 

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction of P-520 Steam Plant Decentralization at Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD), San Diego, California. 

This project involves the design and construction for decentralizing the production of steam-based space heating, domestic hot water heating, and process heating.
 Decentralization shall be accomplished by installing individual boilers at each building and responding to various facility improvements associated with each building. For each building, high efficiency natural gas water boilers, electric heaters, or similar heating system retrofits shall replace the existing steam heating system. High efficiency natural gas-fired water heaters, electric water heaters, or similar domestic water heating retrofits shall be provided for heating domestic hot water (DHW). A single heating plant with short sections of underground piping shall serve each building in the group where groups of buildings are clustered together or space restrictions prevent separate systems for each building.

The project includes renovations of all affected building interiors where the existing heating systems are renovated within the occupied portions of existing buildings.
 Renovations include ceiling, wall, and roofing repairs, as well as furring to accommodate mechanical piping and electrical renovations. Mechanical utility work includes upgrading and expanding the natural gas laterals or valve box or vault for the underground natural gas piping system to provide the required gas service to the new gas-fired system retrofits and/or providing new gas lateral for building where there are no existing gas service. Each building shall service new gas loads as well as existing loads for building with existing gas service. Gas service to each facility shall include service meters with pulse output capable of remote reading. Electrical utility work includes modification of existing underground electrical to accommodate the decentralized steam system retrofits.
 Demolish the existing aboveground steam distribution system and disconnect from the existing central cogeneration steam plant to accomplish full decentralization of the steam system. Demolish existing steam tunnels, trenches, and manholes. Repair paving, parking aprons, and other surfaces where tunnels, trenches, and manholes are removed.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the annual size standard is $15 million. The estimated price range for design and construction is between $25,000,000 and $35,000,000. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1  Technical Approach, Factor 2  Experience, Factor 3  Past Performance, Factor 4  Safety; Phase 2: Factor 5  Technical Solution, Factor 6  Small Business Utilization, Factor 7  Price.
 

The Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal. A maximum of five Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting. 

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil by 30 January 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.
 

Prospective Offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. 

A pre-proposal conference for Phase One will not be held. A pre-proposal presentation and document with frequently asked questions will be posted along with the solicitation on www.neco.navy.mil for your review.

Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm's ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm's capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance - Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.

<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR SOLICITATION AND NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Purpose: This Sources Sought Notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) small business, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>
<p>CMS is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified 8(a) program participants to the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF), Long Term Care Facility (LTCH) and Hospice Quality Reporting Programs Support, Outreach and Program Support. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>This notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.<br />A. BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is the federal agency that administers the Medicare, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs. CMS seeks to promote higher quality and more efficient health care for Medicare beneficiaries, and our efforts are furthered by quality reporting programs coupled with public reporting of that information. Quality reporting programs already exist for various settings such as hospital inpatient services via the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program, hospital outpatient services via the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program, and physicians and other eligible professionals' services via the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS).</p>
<p>The work under this contract aligns with the work and mission under Section 3004 of Health Care Reform H.R. 3590, Quality Reporting for Long-Term Care Hospitals, Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals, and Hospice Programs amending Sections 1886(j)(m) and 1814(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395).</p>
<p>Quality reporting programs have been established for Long Term Care Hospitals (LTCH), Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRF), and hospice programs.

ATTACHMENT A

GENERAL DEFINITIONS FOR LABORATORY SERVICES


1.	Critical Value - A test result that requires evaluation by a physician or other health care provider as soon as verified.  Failure to take appropriate action as a result of a critical value might cause harm or undue suffering for a patient. 

2.	Esoteric Test - A test that is similar to specialized tests, except they can only be done in a few laboratories throughout the country.

3.	Frozen Section - A biopsy specimen that is immediately frozen and cut with cryostat; then mounted on a slide, stained, and examined by a pathologist.  Frozen sections provide a rapid diagnosis to the physician during surgery. 

4.	Overflow - A test usually performed in the ordering activity lab, which might be referred to the contractor's laboratory in case of instrument breakdown or other circumstances interfering with the ordering facility's ability to analyze the specimens. 

5.	Paraffin Block - A tissue specimen that has been embedded in paraffin wax that the sections can be cut for histologic examination. 

6.	Proficiency Testing - An assessment of the accuracy of testing by a laboratory based on the analysis of an unknown specimen analyzed by a large number of other labs.  The proficiency survey is conducted by an organization or agency authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services to do so.

7.	Reference or Referral Laboratory - The contract laboratory that provides testing, and examination of specimens provided by the medical treatment facility. 

8.	Reference Value - A range of test values expected for a designated normal population of individuals. 

9.	Routine Test - A test that is usually performed at high volume in which the result is required in 24 hours generally.										
10.	Slides.  Glass surface containing biological material to be analyzed. 

11.	Specimen - A body fluid or tissue sample removed for medical examination and analytical testing. 

12.	Special handling - Unusual circumstances may dictate the need for a specimen to be picked up specially, run out of sequence at a special time, or reported within a shorter than usual time. 

13.	Specialized Test - A test that is performed in low volume but the technology, expense, or time-consuming nature of each test, is such that some delay is expected.  The delay usually occurs to allow tests received from different centers to be batched to make the operation cost-effected. 

14.	STAT - A designated category of tests that requires immediate processing to expedite results to physicians handling potentially life-threatening cases. 

15.	Surgical Specimen - A sample or part of an organ or tissue removed during Surgery for medical examination and analytical testing. 

16.	Tests - Diagnostic assays to evaluate a patient's physiological condition. 				
17.	Turnaround Time (TAT) - The length of elapsed time between pick-up or dispatch of specimen from the contractor's laboratory until the receipt of the completed printed report back in the lab.  Exception:  For STAT tests, the TAT shall begin at the time of notification by the ordering activity laboratory to the contractor.  These definitions apply whether the contractor or a subcontractor performs the test.

<DESC>Small Business Sources Sought Notice NIH-NINDS-15-01
<p>Phase I Clinical Trials Facility for Development of Neurotherapeutics</p>
<p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications and capabilities to provide a full service, turn-key Phase I Clinical Trials Facility in support of the development of novel neurotherapeutic agents. This full service facility is to perform a full range of services from protocol development through submission of clinical study reports to be used by the NINDS, sponsored Investigators or Contributors in support of Investigative New Drug (IND) applications.</p>
<p>The emphasis of this Phase I Clinical Trials Facility will be to perform Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Phase I clinical trials utilizing NINDS-supplied novel agents developed by NINDS, sponsored Investigators or Contributors with an emphasis on first in human testing to determine the tolerated dose range, the dosing regimen, the safety profile and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Assigned Phase I Clinical Trials may also include pharmacodynamics (PD), and evaluation of biological effects and early signs of efficacy. The data generated from these trials will be used by NINDS, its Contributors or sponsored Investigators in support of IND applications and ultimately serve as the basis to advance candidate compounds for further clinical development. It is anticipated that one to two Phase I Clinical Trials will be performed per year for the duration of the contract, and that multiple Phase I Clinical Trials will likely need to be conducted concurrently at the Phase I Clinical Trials Facility.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541712. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 or fewer employees.</p>
<p>Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside (where large businesses would be excluded from competing), at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be "in-house". Specifically, FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," states that "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) by the United States Air Force, Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, and Networks (C3I&amp;N), C3I Infrastructure Division (AFLCMC/HNI) Hanscom AFB, MA. It is the Government's intent to execute, by means of other than full and open competition, a modification to extend the Period of Performance (PoP) of the existing Air Force Network (AFNet) Total Lifecycle Acquisition &amp; Support (ATLAS) Task Order (TO) FA8771-04-D-0003 RSQ3 awarded to Harris IT Services Corporation. <br /><br />The PoP of for the existing performance based ATLAS task order on NETCENTS I ends on 14 April 2015. Upon expiration of the ATLAS task order, the Air Force will risk a break in critical support services to the AFNet systems fielded by AFLCMC/HNI. AFLCMC/HNI intends to extend the contract services by executing up to a 5-month Firm Fixed Price (FFP) extension with the incumbent Harris IT Services Corporation. The period of the extension would begin on 14 April 2015 and would be extended as needed to 9 September 2015. The extension from 14 April 2015 to 09 September 2015 would ensure there is not a break in crucial support services to the AFNet fielded by AFLCMC/HNI. <br />This extension will solely provide for additional Firm Fixed Price services. This extension will allow for time to complete the solicitation and award of the competitive follow-on Cyber Support Services (CSS) contract action. ATLAS provides Tier 2 and 3 AFNet Response Center (ARC) helpdesk support to the AFNet for 100 Active Duty and Reserve Air Force Bases and National Guard (ANG) Bases. Additionally, ATLAS provides SME troubleshooting of AFNet incidents, Technical Order (TO) and Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) development and dissemination, vulnerability analysis, procurement and warehouse capability, obsolescence management and integration testing for AFNet systems. <br />The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC &sect; 2304(c)(1), implemented as follows: <br />FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) - Services may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br />Parties may identify their interest; accompanied by supporting literature to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Specialist. Please direct all interest, questions and concerns regarding this NOCA via email to Mr. Coit, Contracting Officer, at Anthony.Coit@us.af.mil and Mr. Mann, Contracting Specialist, at Sean.Mann.3@us.af.mil no later than 12:00 PM EDT, on 27-JAN-2015. <br />No telephone responses will be accepted. All information received from responsible sources will be considered.

The Ombudsman hears concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, communicates those concerns from industry or Government personnel, and assists in the resolution of those concerns. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. When approached with an issue or query, the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry. <br />The AFLCMC ombudsman can be contacted at:<br />AFLCMC Ombudsman<br />1790 10th Street <br />Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433<br />Telephone: <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1" style="white-space: nowrap;">973-255-5472<a style="position: static !important; margin: 0px; width: 16px; bottom: 0px; display: inline; white-space: nowrap; float: none; height: 16px; vertical-align: middle; overflow: hidden; top: 0px; cursor: hand; right: 0px; left: 0px;" title="Call: 973-255-5472" href="#"><img style="position: static !important; margin: 0px; width: 16px; bottom: 0px; display: inline; white-space: nowrap; float: none; height: 16px; vertical-align: middle; overflow: hidden; top: 0px; cursor: hand; right: 0px; left: 0px;" title="Call: 973-255-5472" src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="" /></a></span><br />Email: jill.qillinghamallen.1@us.af.mil<br />

It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions. The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth. It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires. <br>  <br> Acquisition Strategy:  <br> The objective of the Counter Fire Target Acquisition Radar System (AN/TPQ-53) program is to provide Full Rate Production and deployment of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar system.

This requirement also includes potential engineering and design upgrade efforts as well as efforts to address obsolescence and production issues.  <br>  <br> NAICS code is 334511.  <br>  <br> Places of performance include support in both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the CONUS (OCONUS) locations. <br>  <br> This purchase will be made on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a) (2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br>  <br> Lockheed Martin is the Original Equipment Manufacturer of the AN/TPQ-53. The Government does not possess a full technical data package that would allow full and open competition for the development, production, and/or sustainment of AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems. The Government does not intend to use Part 12 for this acquisition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 28 January 2015 at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated solicitation release date is 02 February 2015, and the anticipated award date is 2QFY16.  <br>  <br> For information regarding this purchase, please contact Laura Crescenzo, Contract Specialist, 443-861-4793, Email: laura.m.crescenzo.civ@mail.mil or James Farnsworth, Contracting Officer, 443-861-4760, Email: james.e.farnsworth8.civ@mail.mil.  <br>

<SOLNBR>SPM2DP11R0002
<CONTACT>Neil Mcavinue, Phone 215-737-3123, Email Neil.Mcavinue@dla.mil
<DESC>1. Summary/Introduction
<p>a) The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Medical Supply Chain, is the contracting activity.</p>
<p>b) The acquisition will result in an Indefinite Quantity Contract for tableted Adenovirus Vaccine Types 4 and 7.</p>
<p>c) The total duration of this contract will be for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. [redacted]</p>
<p>d) The statutory authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />2. Description of Agency's Need (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(a)):</p>
<p>I) Background</p>
<p>a) Adenoviruses are common pathogens that often are associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal illness in young persons. Adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7 have caused outbreaks of respiratory illness in young adults in basic military training. Beginning in 1971, all military recruits received oral, live, enteric-coated vaccines that were licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as safe and effective in preventing illness from adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7. In 1996, the sole manufacturer, Wyeth Laboratories, ceased production of adenoviral vaccines. [redacted] As supplies dwindled during the next few years, outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory illness re-emerged in military settings. The Government currently monitors infection rates on a weekly basis as reported by the Febrile Respiratory Illness Surveillance published by the Naval Health Research Center, San Diego. Based on recent surveillance statistics, the infection rate has ranged between 13,320 and 15,120 cases per year.</p>
<p>b) Since the cessation of production of the vaccine in 1996, the Department of Defense (DoD) has renewed efforts at securing a supplier. In 2001, a developmental contract was issued to Barr Laboratories by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) for the purpose of restoring adenovirus vaccine production capability. [redacted] Barr's offer was rated the best value to the Government based on factors outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>c) An award for the low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract was issued to Barr Laboratories in September 2010 by USAMRAA under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The contract has an effective date of September 24, 2010 for an 18-month period (ending March 24, 2012). The contract was for a fixed quantity of 270,000 doses [redacted]. A unit dose consists of one (1) tablet each of type 4 and type 7 adenovirus vaccine. The contract calls for delivery of 120,000 doses by July 24, 2011 (i.e. 10 months after award), with the balance of 150,000 doses by March 24, 2012.</p>
<p>d) The LRIP contract requires Barr to deliver the vaccine to military recruitment centers throughout the United States. All the military services will be users of the vaccine, not just the Army. The DLA contract is expected to be awarded by September 2012. USAMRAA is currently preparing to award a bridge contract in the event of a gap in supply between the LRIP contract and the DLA contract. If delivery occurs at the same rate under the DLA contract as under the LRIP contract, the first deliveries won't occur until July 2013 (i.e. 10 months after anticipated award date). The USAMRAA bridge contract is expected to fill this gap and include option periods, which may or may not be exercised, depending on whether the DLA contract is in place. There is no expectation of overstocking for this vaccine due to the fact that the DLA contract will be an indefinite quantity type contract with a guaranteed minimum low enough to allow for flexible ordering. The vaccine is required to have a minimum shelf life of 12 months upon delivery to the Government.</p>
<p>II). DLA Acquisition - Description of Need/Supplies</p>
<p>a) For the DLA acquisition, an indefinite quantity type contract is planned, with an estimated annual requirement of 270,000 doses [redacted]. The guaranteed minimum quantity per year is set at 150,000 doses and the annual maximum quantity is 335,000 doses. The total duration of this contract will be for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. [redacted] <br /><br />b) [redacted]</p>
<p>c) There is no surge requirement. The adenovirus is administered only to Service inductees, generally not to active duty personnel. The maximum amount is considered sufficient to cover potential increases in the annual number of recruits.</p>
<p><br />3. Authority for Other than Full and Open Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(B):</p>
<p>a) The applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As a result of the aforesaid developmental contract, Barr Laboratories, a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical, is the only known source with the facilities, knowledge, technical data, and manufacturing capability necessary to provide the adenovirus vaccine. Barr was acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Israel) in December 2008. Barr is also the only known firm to have undergone the clinical trials and product testing necessary to attain a Biologics License Agreement (BLA) for the manufacture and sale of adenovirus vaccine. Official approval of this BLA was granted to Teva by the FDA on March 16, 2011. USAMRAA will no longer contract with Barr for the adenovirus vaccine upon completion of their bridge contract, which is expected to follow the initial LRIP contract.</p>
<p>b) The lack of additional sources is also due to the fact that DoD is currently the only customer for this type of vaccine and the demand level is not sufficient to support multiple competing sources.</p>
<p><br />4. Price/Cost Considerations (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(c)):</p>
<p>As the Contracting Officer, I anticipate that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on an analysis of Barr's cost and pricing data to be submitted with their proposal. Currently, there is no commercial market for the adenovirus vaccine and DoD will be the only customer.</p>
<p>5. Market Research/Efforts to Obtain Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(D) &amp; (E)):</p>
<p>a) [redacted] In addition to describing the current requirements, we stipulated that a) no Government facilities would be made available for production use, and b) FDA approval of the vaccine would be required before award. [redacted]</p>
<p>b) According to the website Clinicaltrials.gov, there are no current public clinical trials for the purpose of marketing a vaccine for adenovirus type 4 or type 7. This website indicates firms that are conducting clinical trials for the purpose of medical research or attaining FDA approval, although it may not include all such efforts.</p>
<p>c) [redacted]</p>
<p>d) In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), this requirement was synopsized in FedBizOpps on February 8, 2011. Additionally, a Sources Sought notice was published in FedBizOpps on March 10, 2011 describing the requirements and requesting information from potential sources. This justification will also be made available for public inspection after award in accordance with FAR 6.305.</p>
<p><br />6. Actions Being Taken to Overcome Barriers to Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304 (f)(3)(F):</p>
<p>a) There is no commercial market for an adenovirus vaccine. There may be non-Government uses of the vaccine, such as for a college or university student body or a prison population; however, there is no current demand for using the vaccine in these situations.</p>
<p>b) The DoD demand level for this vaccine is considered insufficient to sustain more than one supplier. The expenses of capital and technological investments, and compliance with FDA regulations and licensure are prohibitive barriers to entry in this market. There are no known firms other than Barr that have gone through this process. All previous offerors and suppliers of this vaccine, as well as identified producers of the virus itself, will be solicited for this requirement. In addition, market research will be conducted prior to option exercise in an effort to identify new sources.</p>
<p>c) I hereby certify that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br /><br />The National Institute of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC); Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC), on behalf of the CC Nuclear Pharmacy Department intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award a Fixed Price Order, to ABX Advanced Biochemical compounds to procure precursors for the production and manufacture of PET Drugs under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325412, and the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br /><br />The following verbiage is directly from the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC).<br /><br />The acquisition is to procure precursors for the production and manufacture of the following PET Drugs under the following approved FDA INDs: [68Ga]DOTATATE (IND # 119,098), 6-[18F]FluoroDOPA (IND # 35,513) and 6-[18F]Fluorodopamine (IND # 33,866). These three PET Drugs are vital to the PET Department mission. Each precursor is a key ingredient to the manufacture and cannot be changed without amendment to the IND and approval of the FDA. ABX is the trusted source for these three precursors.<br />The PET Drugs: [68Ga]DOTATATE (IND # 119,098), 6-[18F]FluoroDOPA (IND # 35,513) and 6-[18F]Fluorodopamine (IND # 33,866) are routinely prepared by the PET Department for the use in human imaging protocols.<br /><br />The three precursor compounds needed to prepare Ga-68 DOTATATE, F-18 DOPA, and F-18 DOPAMINE, are used under FDA investigational new drug (IND) applications, 119098, 35513, and 33866 respectively. The manufacturing of these radiopharmaceuticals under IND requires a trusted source starting material (e.g. precursor) as these compounds are necessary to guarantee the quality, strength, purity, and safety of the finished radiopharmaceutical. The INDs on file with the FDA list ABX as the supplier of the precursor compounds. Any changes to the supplier of these critical components of the PET drug production process would require validation of the integrity of the component (a costly and timely undertaking). Also, amendments to the FDA would need to be submitted upon completion of the validation process for any non-ABX precursor compound. Finally, all precursors from ABX are in stock and ready to ship. Current supply of precursors are projected to run out at the end of January so it is imperative to use the ABX vendor to guarantee an uninterrupted supply of PET drugs for clinical center imaging studies. Such imaging studies are an integral component of patient care and the research mission of the Clinical center.</p>
<p>All responses are due to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.</p>

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Teknologic, LLC to acquire Juvenile Salmonid Acoustic Telemetry Systems( JSATS), 11330.
<p><br />The office of National Marine Fisheries Santa Cruz Laboratory located in Santa Cruz, CA has thoroughly compared available receiver models in head to head field trials. The program office obtained specification sheets from all JSATS receiver vendors and obtained price quotes for all three make-models tested. The test consisted of drifting nine JSATS transmitters past moored receivers. Drifts were repeated eight times. The only model that performed well enough to meet our needs and had deployment endurance of more than 100 days is the Teknologic, LLC JSATS 11330. We required an average of at least 4 detections per transmitter as it drifted past a receiver and an endurance of at least 100 days. Only the Teknologic, LLC receivers performed well enough (&gt;4 mean detects per drift per tag).</p>
<p>This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. It is the Government's belief that only Teknologic, LLC can meet the government's requirement for JSATS. However, interested firms or individuals may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting in writing their name and information to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions concerning this announcement must be emailed to Maria Mendoza at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov or faxed at (206)527-7513. This is a simplified acquisition.</p>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center San Diego intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 to McLaughlin Research Corporation, 130 Eugene ONeill Drive, Suite 100, New London, CT 06320.

MRC develops ASLs Technical Data Packages (TDPs) for their Temporary Submarine Alterations.  They also develop Departure from Specification (DFS) Data packages for submission to NAVSEA for approval.  The proposed tasking will require  revision of an existing Technical Data Package.  The MRC personnel proposed were the original authors of this TDP and possess an indepth technical and intrinsic knowledge of all aspects of these specific TEMPALT designs.
  If another contractor were utilized to perform this task, the Government would face a substantial duplication of cost and delays that would inevitably effect the fleet operational schedule.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the applicable business size is $15M.
  Interested parties shall submit information that indicates their ability to satisfy this requirement via e-mail.  Requests must include company name, address, POC name, telephone number, CAGE Code, DUNS number, NAICS code, applicable business size, and Tax ID number.  Responses are due by Friday, January 16th, 2015, 12:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time, via email. 

If no responses are received, FLCSD will proceed with the sole source award.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a proposal is being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number SP4703-15-Q-0009 is issued as a request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.

The small business size standard is $27,500,000.00. <strong>This acquisition is issued as unrestricted acquisition utilizing Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures. This is a sole-source requirement for SAS Institute Inc.</strong> Justification for this requirement is pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the Agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities. DCAA currently owns licenses for SAS software. Maintenance and support subscription renewals are required for this software. These renewals ensure that DCAA receives the latest product updates and technical support during the fiscal year. This order must be issued on a sole-source basis because SAS is the sole source for the maintenance renewal of the software currently licensed by DCAA under License Agreement Number 01847. This is a firm-fixed price contract. Partial proposals will not be accepted. Pricing for all line items must be submitted with the proposal. <br /><br />This procurement is for renewal of SAS software maintenance and support.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.</p>
<p>The QSL for Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas will be established approximately June 2015 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately July 2015 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Oxygen Masks and Nasal Cannulas. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $580,482.09. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Fifteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 74.16% ($430,465.90) of the total volume in sales ($580,482.09). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one via the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.<br />5. Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, and Number of eaches in Unit of Sale.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>The anticipated award will be a FFP contract based upon the LPTA quote which is most advantageous for the USG.  Any use of any products or manufacturer named "Weinman" is not an endorsement or preference for Weinman products.  Rather, it is being used to assist the selling community to illustrate the USG's need and it identifies the name brand product which will satisfy this need; however, an equal to Weinman will be accepted if those products equal the specifications of Weinman products and fulfill the USG?s need. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>[] (1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995) (41 U.S.C. 4704 and 10 U.S.C. 2402).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Phase One, Technical Acceptability.  The offeror must demonstrate its ability to meet or exceed the Brand Name Salient Characteristics to be determined technically acceptable.  

Phase Two, Non-Price Factor Evaluation.  The following non-price factors will be used to evaluate technically acceptable offers:

Factor A: Data Quality.  During the demonstration the offeror shall demonstrate their firms well data quality.  The more detailed the well data, the more value to the Government.

<p><br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the following factors: Technical capability, past performance and price. Award will be made to the low price, technically acceptable offeror, after which no other offers will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Factor I: Technical capability - The Government will evaluate the quoters technical submission to determine compliance with the Performance Work Statement. The technical submissions will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Acceptable is defined as meeting the government's requirements and Unacceptable is defined as does not meet the government's requirement's. If a quote's technical submission is determined to be Unacceptable it will no longer be evaluated or considered for award.</p>
<p>Factor II: Past Performance Acceptability: The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the quoter's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the quoter's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Past performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis in accordance with the ratings and description outlined below:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings <br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable: Based on quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully provide requested support services, or the quoter's performance record is unknown .<br />Unacceptable: Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully provide the required support services.</p>
<p>Note: Quoters lacking relevant past performance history or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorable on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. <br /><br />Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed. Work yet-to-be performed, and work prior to the last 5 years, will not be considered. <br /><br />In order to be considered Technically Acceptable the offeror must receive an "Acceptable" rating in both technical capability and past performance (Factor I and Factor II). Failure to obtain an "Acceptable" rating in Factor I or Factor II will result in an overall "Unacceptable" rating and elimination from the competition.</p>
<p>Factor III: Price: Quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a). Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar services, sales history for the same or similar services, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010049 is assigned for tracking purposes only.

<p>USCG ALC<br />1664 Weeksville Road<br />SRR Hangar 75, HSCG38-15-Q-200052<br />Attn: Terrie L. Pickardcg38<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p class="Default" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;CG Times&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;CG Times&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. </span></p>

If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;CG Times&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in </span><span style="font-family: &quot;CG Times&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: blue; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">FAR 33.103</span><span style="font-family: &quot;CG Times&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS&nbsp;<br /><br />The evaluation factors below are not formal source selection procedures.</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award: Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA), responsive and responsible Offeror. This is a competitive LPTA selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offers, with satisfactory past performance, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this effort. For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 2 - Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability<br />In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate capability to meet the following standards:</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall submit their Technical Capability Information as Volume I, and be no more than 3 pages.</p>
<p>2. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach to accomplish assembly in accordance with MIL-A-8625 and MIL-STD-130 as required by the technical drawings.</p>
<p>3. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach, including tools and equipment required to perform assembly of the ATDC Frames. Specifically, the offeror shall provide the following information: Tool Name, Manufacturer, Part Number, and a brief description of how the tool will be used during the assembly process. The technical approach will be evaluated for:</p>
<p>a. Compliance with Drawing 8554696.<br />b. Compliance with the requirements in the SOW.<br />c. Compliance with delivery schedule as detailed in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. The offeror's technical proposal shall enable Government evaluating personnel to make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the proposal will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work. Each technical proposal shall be specific, detailed, and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the Statement of Work requirements. Proposals that paraphrase the specifications / Statement of Work or attest that "standard procedures will be employed" are inadequate to demonstrate how the proposal complies with the Statement of Work and will render the proposal "Unacceptable".</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors must not have unsatisfactory past performance. The Offeror shall not submit performance data for this factor. The government may seek relevant performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as DCMA, CPARS, FAPIIS, or PPIRS; or other government databases and other available sources. The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. When past performance is evaluated, the outcome is satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance will disqualify an Offeror from award. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance; however, the offeror would be rated neutral. Satisfactory and Neutral are determined to be passing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price Evaluation<br />The government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable offers with satisfactory or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>b. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>c. Selection Decision:<br />The government shall select the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsive, and responsible offer for award.</p>
<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that provide a quote will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.<br />To be eligible for award of a Government contract, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). The link to the website is https://www.sam.gov.<br />No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. Quotes must be submitted in portable document format (.pdf) by email to the Primary Point of Contact (POC) identified below. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to submit offers to the POC at NSWC PHD by the closing date of January 21, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>

<DESC>Question:	In regards to the referenced solicitation, can you clarify the requirements for licensure for the Asbestos Survey Professional? There are statements within the solicitation about lab licensure requirements, but there is limited information on the Asbestos Survey Professional.
Answer: 	Yes, The VA requires the contractor to comply with State of Florida licensure requirements.  IT IS THE VA THAT MANDATES THIS COMPLIANCE.  In addition, the VA mandates the author of an asbestos project design to meet the AHERA requirements of attendance in an EPA MAP accredited training program for Asbestos Project Designer.  The final Statement of Work will be revised to incorporate this information.
  Question:	When I received confirmation on my request to attend the site visit, I received an e-mail stating that we are to meet in room 328 of Building 24.  Please verify that it is room 328, as the instructions originally stated room 327.
Answer: 	All vendors are to meet in room 328 of Building 24.  There was an error on the site visit instructions that incorrectly listed room 327.

<p><em><strong>Interested parties are advised that notices and information about the RFSE program were previously placed on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. Due to numbering requirements, this number has changed to FA8214-15-R-0001. Interested parties may want to update their notices on FBO.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Contracting Division, Hill Air Force Base, UT intends to issue a solicitation for Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE) Production effort. The RFSE is a nuclear-certified test set. It is comprised of radio frequency, electrical, and structural hardware (including through-hole soldered multi-layer boards) which is integrated with government-provided, existing, non-commercial software. Under the RFSE production effort, the contractor will:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - produce and deliver up to seven RFSE suites, up to four sets of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; support equipment, and initial spares in accordance with the applicable <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standards and government-provided drawings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - provide interim contractor support for all RFSE units;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - train users on how to operate, test, maintain, troubleshoot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;problems,&nbsp;and do field-level repairs the RFSE.<br />Contractors must have the ability to perform design requalification and recertification if circumstances necessitate a change in the nuclear-certified design of the RFSE-such a change would require nuclear surety and nuclear safety experience. Due to the nuclear-certified design, contractors must have a well-defined and detailed manufacturing plan (including environmental controls), stringent configuration control, and a high degree of quality assurance.</p>
<p>Delivery of the first RFSE unit will be made no later than 20 months after contract award, and all RFSE units and support equipment must be delivered no later than 44 months after contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will result in issuance of a Definitive Contract with multiple options. Draft parts of the solicitation critical to an offeror's understanding of the requirement have been released on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. This included Section L, Section M, and the model contract (with Contract Line Item Numbering Structure). Interested parties who seek more information on this acquisition (including but not limited to quantity, unit of issue, and destination information) are advised to review that draft release. The draft will be updated upon solicitation release, and offerors are required to review the solicitation for any updates.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition (not a small business set aside), using the lowest price, technically acceptable source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection and the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures (effective 1 July 2011) as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 December 2014 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).</p>
<p>The solicitation (except the technical data package-see below) will be released on FBO. Paper copies of the solicitation (except technical orders-see below) will not be mailed. Interested offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation and are encouraged to register for notification through FBO.</p>
<p>While the solicitation will be placed on FBO, the technical data package (TDP) will not. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application, and the TDP contains <strong>export controlled data</strong>. As such, the only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. Those that are certified and registered will have a DD Form 2345 certified by the Joint Certification Program. For those contractors that do not have a certified DD Form 2345, but would like to participate in this acquisition, the form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at</p>
<p>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that approval of a DD2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form now rather than upon or after release of the solicitation is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the TDP, offerors must request the TDP from the contracting officer listed in the below point of contact section. The request must include a copy of the offeror's current, approved DD Form 2345. Once an offeror's DD Form 2345 is verified, access to the drawings, specifications, and other program documents through the software program, TopVue, will be provided to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. After approval of the controlling office, technical orders will be provided to the data custodian by mail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not permitted</span>. All offerors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov) to be eligible for award. In addition, offerors must ensure their Annual Representations and Certifications are updated and current.</p>

Mandatory Language: The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is a full and open requirement. All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The Contractor is required to be "Export Controlled" certified to receive and view the drawings for this solicitation. To become certified, register at website www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp (for guidance, go to FAQ). Foreign owned firms are advised to contact Tina Vinson at (405) 734-8128 or email tina.vinson@tinker.af.mil before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions to receiving an award. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards. First Article testing is required to ensure the reliability and integrity of the item and operational safety of the weapon system that uses it. First Article testing is waived if the offeror is the prime contractor, Pratt and Whitney. All other offerors can apply for a waiver of First Article approval under the following condition(s): Offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar article to the prime contractor for delivery to the Government; offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Government, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Government; provided not more than 36 months have elapsed since completion of the contract. Note: Determination of acceptability of 'or similar' items may only be made by the engineering office initiating this First Article requirement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download on the release date only from www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Tina Vinson at (405) 734-8128 or email at tina.vinson@us.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for "Next Generation Closed Circuit Mine Escape Respirators (CCMER)."<br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the NAICS code 541712 for the potential acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft Statement of Work:</span></strong><br /><br />1. INTRODUCTION
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) leads the development of self-escape apparatus to provide breathing gas to mining personnel operating in various capacities underground in environments containing hazardous gas components; in the event of an emergency. This Request for Proposals is for the development and manufacture of NIOSH certified Next Generation Closed Circuit Mine Escape Respirators (CCMER) that could be used for surviving and escaping from a mine following an emergency that renders the mine atmosphere irrespirable.</p>
<p>Two types of self-escape apparatus are currently being developed by NIOSH-OMSHR through contracts with other government agencies and industry. These efforts would yield prototypes capable of providing up to one hour of breathable gas to an escaping miner during an emergency. One development project would result in a backpack style self-escape apparatus prototype termed Backpack SCSR (BSCSR) and another would result in a vest style self-escape apparatus prototype termed Closed-Circuit Escape Vest (CCEV). Both are closed-circuit (rebreather) designs using gaseous oxygen from gas cylinders and Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) CO2 absorbent sheets manufactured by Micropore Inc. The BSCSR has a mechanical oxygen control and the CCEV has an electronic oxygen control. Both units are to be designed according to the performance guidelines outlined in Part 84 of Title 42 Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR Part 84) including Sub-part O NIOSH standard.</p>
<p>In separate development efforts, components for this type of self-escape breathing apparatus, namely Docking &amp; Switch-Over Valves (DSOVs), Hood/Masks (HMCs) and Very High Pressure Cylinders (VHPC) were developed through previous funded contracts with NIOSH-OMSHR. The DSOVs were developed to enable connection of two breathing apparatus (either two CCERs, also known as SCSRs or an SCSR to an Open Circuit Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, also known as SCBA) to allow a seamless transfer to breathing from one device to the other. Hoods with inner masks are expected to be easier to use than current SCSRs fitted with a mouthpiece, allowing natural breathing through the nose and mouth as opposed to breathing only through the mouth. They further eliminate the need to fit nose clips and goggles, thus simplifying the donning process. Hoods and masks also allow speech diaphragms to be incorporated, enabling the wearer to communicate verbally during escape, which is not possible in current SCSR designs. Very high pressure carbon composite oxygen cylinders allow a smaller and lighter oxygen supply container in an SCSR. Prototypes are now available to be integrated and tested on functional breathing apparatus.</p>
<p>Outputs from these development projects would form the basis for the Dockable Self-Contained (Closed Circuit) Self-Escape Respirators with Hoods (CCMER).</p>
<p>2. NEXT GENERATION CLOSED CIRCUIT MINE ESCAPE RESPIRATORS (CCMER)</p>
<p>CCMERs need to be designed so that they could be worn comfortably and continuously by miners during their daily work routine and function as an escape breathing apparatus in the event of an emergency. The proposed CCMER should be designed and manufactured as a closed-circuit oxygen rebreather, whereby the user breathes the same gas in a closed loop similar to the current developments underway by NIOSH-OMSHR e.g. backpack and vest style SCSRs. Exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) is to be absorbed by a scrubber system and oxygen addition is according to the user's needs. The oxygen addition may either be manually or electronically controlled. The successful CCMER design must be certified to 42CFR84 standards including Sub-part O for mine use and must meet MSHA 30CFR75 and 30CFR18 permissibility regulations for use in underground mines. The design/s must be jointly certified by both NIOSH and MSHA. The capacity of the units should be cap 2 and 3 as defined in sub-part O to meet mining requirements. The CCMER must incorporate docking &amp; switch-over valves (DSOV) for seamless transfer from one breathing device to another and hood with inner masks &amp; speech diaphragm (HMC) for ease of donning, use and communication ability. Due consideration should be given in the design to result in a small package which can either be donned separately, or integrated into a miner's ensemble. Due to the necessity of its regular use by the miner while underground, the CCMER can be designed to incorporate many of the tool-holders/pockets/ attachment points currently utilized by miners in their day-to-day work environment. Features such as mini-gauges for determining oxygen cylinder pressure and indicators for the CO2 scrubber monitoring during routine maintenance/inspection should be incorporated. A quick-connect oxygen supply line would be is needed to provide recharging of the oxygen cylinder. As the CCMER is to be continually worn by the miner while underground, and readily accessible for deployment when needed, and it must be designed with human factors considerations.</p>
<p>Two versions of the CCMER are possible:</p>
<p>2.1. CCMER - V (Vest Style DSCSR)<br />The CCMER - V may be based on the CCEV and need to incorporate a DSOV and HMC. It must be certified to 42CFR84 standards including Sub-part O for mine use and must meet MSHA 30CFR75 and 30CFR18 permissibility regulations.</p>
<p>2.2. CCMER - B (Backpack Style DSCSR)<br />The CCMER - B may be based on the BSCSR and need to incorporate a DSOV and HMC. It must be certified to 42CFR84 standards including Sub-part O and must meet MSHA 30CFR75 and 30CFR18 permissibility regulations.</p>
<p>Contractor is responsible for gaining certification from the respective approval bodies for the final saleable production CCMER</p>
<p>3. PROTOTYPES UNDER DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>3.1. Backpack SCSR (BSCSR) Prototype<br />The miner's backpack SCSR is comprised of an ergonomically designed harness system with the backpack SCSR module positioned in the area of the small of the back. The backpack SCSR is designed as a closed-circuit rebreather using a mechanical controlled oxygen delivery system to maintain the required oxygen level in the breathing loop. The belt portion of the harness has features found on a miner's belt.</p>
<p>3.2. Closed-Circuit Escape Vest (CCEV) Prototype<br />The miner's CCEV design is a fully closed-circuit rebreather that integrates the CO2 scrubber into a conformal shape inside a vest form. It uses an oxygen sensor for monitoring the loop oxygen level and an electronic oxygen control system, whereby oxygen is added automatically into the breathing loop via an electro-mechanical solenoid valve at a rate that matches the metabolic <br />consumption of the wearer. A miner's belt is an integral part of the CCEV.</p>

Name:  Andrea Roman, Contract Specialist

Organization: AAQ-420

Region: HQ - FAA Headquarters (Washington, DC)

Phone Number: 202-267-4691

E-Mail: andrea.roman@faa.gov

Date: 12/29/14

Phase: Commercial/Simplified

Procurement Method: Market Survey

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Line of Business has a requirement for ISO 9001:2008 registrar support services. Aerospace and transportation industry changes necessitate that the FAAs Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) that will enable the total organization to continually manage change that effectively improves safety oversight of the United States (U.S.) National Aerospace System (NAS).  The AVS organization is also deeply involved in the Agencies implementation of a Safety Management System (SMS) and the Next-Generation (NEXTGEN) air traffic control systems. The AVS organization is composed of over 7,000 people geographically distributed to over 150 locations that execute system, business and technical processes. Having completed two (2) three-year cycles of registration and surveillance audits, AVS must now complete another recertification audit and surveillance audits to sustain the certificate.  In order to accomplish this goal, AVS requires the services of a qualified contractor to perform the required recertification audit and the subsequent surveillance audits. The current contractor is ABS Quality Evaluation Inc., 16855 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77060 under Contract No. DTFAWA-12-C-00031, which ends 03/31/2015.

The purpose of this survey is to gather information in order to determine whether there is adequate competition among small businesses and to choose the procurement method for this requirement.  If adequate competition is determined to exist among small businesses then the FAA may determine to set aside the requirement for competition among small businesses, if this cannot be determined based on the response to this market survey then the requirement will be open to all business sizes.  The current contract (DTFAWA-12-C-00031) expires on 3/31/2015 and we have no plans to extend. Ninety percent of the ceiling amount on the contract has been awarded. The ceiling amount for the existing contract is $112,700.00.  

All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Andrea Roman, at andrea.roman@faa.gov. No phone calls will be accepted. Please see the attached market survey announcement and statement of work for more details. Responses are due by 10am, EST, February 17, 2015 to andrea.roman@faa.gov.

The estimated magnitude of construction for this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. Contractor registration is required on the System for Award Management (SAM online at www.sam.gov) website.
