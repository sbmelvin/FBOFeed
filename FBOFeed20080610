This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement for a service contract on the Waters QTOF Ultima Mass Spec API-UE488, the CAPLC System and Upgrades for the Masslynx and Protienlyxn Software for the period 07/01/2008 through 06/30/2009.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

JUSTIFICATION

1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). 
USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, National Animal Disease Center
2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).
       a. This contracting action is to certify the move of the Waters qTOF mass spectrometer and for a service agreement for this equipment.
3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).
      Move and service agreement for Waters QTOF Ultima Mass Spectrometer and upgrades for software.
4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).
       10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the agency requirements. 
5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).
           a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2))     
       (1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, 
       "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." 
       (2) The named vendor is the manufacturer of proprietary equipment and upgrades which are not available through other vendors.     The proposed acquisition is for continuation of work currently being performed using equipment from the vendor. This effort requires the vendors to provide for continued maintenance of their proprietary equipment.
6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).
a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required maintenance/software. 
b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.
7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).
       The mass spectrometer is a very sensitive instrument and each manufacturer’s instruments differ in parts, software and technical expertise.  It is therefore critical to maintain our service through Waters Corporation.
8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).
       USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this corporate experience knows that the maintenance/software is proprietary and only available from the vendor identified. 
9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))
       Due to the proprietary maintenance/software needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. 
10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).
       No other sources are available at this time.
11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).
       Vendor for existing equipment have proprietary rights that effectively preclude competing upgrades and maintenance for the equipment. 
12. Technical Requirements and Certifications FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)
I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.

CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(a) 6.303-2(a)(12))
I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct a market survey identifying viable solutions for general-purpose COTS security token server (STS) tools along with the underlying hardware supporting these systems that will satisfy Air Force requirements as stated in a document entitled Security Token Server Protection Profile for Medium Robustness Environment. COTS STS tools identified must have a viable commercial presence in industry.  The government wishes to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications (Small Business, Large Business, etc.).
BACKGROUND:  The Air Force's Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) Initial Infrastructure Build (IIB) includes a common, shared infrastructure for building services, including core services that enable the development of domain-specific and cross domain applications as SOAs, and enables services to be published and made visible, accessible, and consumable across the enterprise. A key objective for the product delivered by the IIB program is to implement an enterprise solution for the Air Force that has enhanced Information Assurance (IA), incorporates data transparency, a net-centric strategy by implementing a Services-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Infrastructure and middleware/applications.

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Lockheed Martin Corporation or recognized successor in interest for Launch Services in support of the AEHF-3, MUOS-2, and AFSPC-2 missions. Three (3) missions will be added to the existing Lockheed Martin EELV Launch Services contract. These three (3) Launch Services will include requirements for the following: 1) Core Vehicle and Upper Stage; 2) Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation: and 3)Booster Storage Costs (if required). The RFP will be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). The Government may elect not to award any of the launch services (described above) as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-3(a)(i) states, "Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization." A J&amp;A may permit Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to Lockheed Martin Corporation or recognized successor in interest, subject to the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>
<p>The Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW) has developed a New Entrant Evaluation Plan (NEEP). The NEEP defines a structured approach for the Wing to evaluate potential new entrants to perform Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launch services. A "new entrant" is any contractor other than current providers of EELV launch services. The evaluation plan identifies the business and technical requirements for a new entrant to be eligible for award of launch services. A business evaluation will determine the responsibility of the new entrant, including financial resources, organization and functional expertise, adequacy of production and launch operations facilities, and the ability to obtain necessary construction and environmental permits. A technical evaluation will determine the new entrant's understanding of, and ability to meet, EELV systems requirements, design maturity, adequacy of development and qualification activities, manufacturing process quality, and demonstrated system flight worthiness. The end result of the new entrant evaluation process will be a formal determination by the Commander, LRSW, submitted to and approved by the Commander, Space and Missile Center, as to the ability of the new entrant to compete for EELV launch services. The intent of this plan is to ensure new entrants, at their own expense, are provided a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities, while protecting the Government's need to acquire systems that meet requirements. Any interested parties or new entrants may contact the PCO (address below) about receiving a copy of the NEEP.</p>
<p>Any interested parties (or new entrants) must (1) be U.S. manufacturers as defined in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal, (2) have successfully demonstrated two (2) missions (intermediate or larger) that inserts payloads into their intended orbits, (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) and presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3, and (4) successfully completed the new entrant evaluation criteria (described above), at their own expense Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services are encouraged to submit a statement of capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to: LRSW/PK, Attn: Ms Allison Flanagan, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Prior EELV experience has shown that the new entrant certification time period may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the missions identified in this NOCA. Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and the described New Entrant Evaluation Plan to initiate activity towards qualifying their launch system for future EELV launch services. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. See note 22. Allison Flanagan, Contracting Officer</p>

<SUBJECT>Repair/Servicing of Caterpillar Main Engines, Generators, ZF Transmissions, Georgian Coast Guard Patrol Vessel
<SOLNBR>HSBP1008Q1817
<RESPDATE>072209
<CONTACT>Arthur S Cooper III, Contracting Officer, Phone 214-905-5533, Fax 214-905-5746, Email Arthur.Cooper@dhs.gov
<DESC>US Customs & Border Protection (CBP) is providing assistance to the Georgia Coast Guard (GCG) by providing service and necessary repairs that may be required to address several performance and other issues currently experienced by GCG its “Orbi” class patrol vessel P-205. P-205, a former “Grif” type patrol vessel, was modernized in 2006 by Batumi Shipbuilding Yard in Georgia (BSY) to include new main engines, generators, electrical and mechanical equipment, navigation systems, hull plating repairs, and complete repainting. The vessel was launched October 2006 and was engaged in law enforcement operations beginning in February 2007 until November 2007. The vessel has been largely idle since November 2007 when several problems were noted with the main engines, generators, and related systems. 

Current performance and other issues to be addressed by this contract include the following:

1.	Reduced power from starboard main engine (Caterpillar C18-E with ZF-665 transmission) was noted 11/07 but both main engines now appear to have reduced power (2080 rpm max for port engine, 2060 rpm for starboard engine as of 3/08). Engines maxed out at 2132 and 2131 rpm (starboard and port respectively) and hull had exceeded 30 knots in sea trials prior to delivery, 1/2007. Starboard main engine recently shut down unexpectedly while underway for observation and testing purposes and would not restart – Recurring air leak in the fuel distribution system was suspected cause. Starboard main engine has since been restarted with no apparent damage following purging of air from fuel lines (6/2008).
2.	Starboard generator shuts down inexplicably while at sea (Caterpillar C-4.4 38ekW); Suspected problem was air leak in the fuel distribution system. 
3.	Current vessel’s fuel distribution system appears to be galvanized, threaded pipe with Teflon tape sealer in the joints.  All system joints are leaking, and only minimal support is noted. 
4.	Main engine exhaust systems may not be in compliance with Caterpillar specifications with regard to required support and avoidance of excess weight borne by the exhaust outlets on the engines.
5.	Main engine exhausts do not appear to have flexible couplings/joints allowing for movement and/or expansion/contraction.
6.	Port and starboard main engine assemblies each currently have at least 1 chromed sub-standard elbow installed for engine/transmission cooling system and perhaps other non-standard external parts. 

In reviewing the contents of the Caterpillar Marine Analyst Service Handbook, it is apparent that BSY did not consider or comply with guidance contained therein with regard to the issues noted above. CBP believes that this non-compliance may be in part responsible for the performance and reliability issues currently being experienced with the vessel.

Contract Performance Objectives:
The primary objectives of this contract are to:
1) Inspect the main engines, ZF transmissions, generators, and their installation on the vessel; validate problems outlined above; identify other problems that require correction;
2) Identify preventive maintenance that is due or that must be performed prior to returning the vessel to active duty; 
3) Inspect the fuel distribution system and exhaust systems of the main engines and generators and identify conflicts with Caterpillar requirements/recommendations and current maritime industry standards for safety and reliability;
4) Using the information gathered in items 1) through 3) above, make recommendations for repairs to the engines and generators necessary to restore them to normal operation and reliability expected given the quantity of engine hours on each item (see table below);
5) Identify appropriate modifications to the fuel distribution system (to include possible conversion of the centerline fuel tank into a “day tank”) which are necessary to comply with Caterpillar requirements and recommendations and otherwise current maritime industry standards for safety and reliability;
6) Identify appropriate modifications to the exhaust systems for the main engines and generators which are necessary to comply with Caterpillar requirements and recommendations and otherwise current maritime industry standards for safety and reliability;
7) Identify appropriate modifications relative to the engine and generator installations that are needed to preclude premature failure of the engines and/or generators, or otherwise extend their longevity;
8) Draft and prepare suitable specifications and system drawings detailing proposed changes/repairs to the fuel distribution system, exhaust systems, and/or other related systems suitable for CBP to provide to a shipyard to utilize in its designing, fabricating (and/or acquiring), and installing the necessary revised system components needed to comply with requirements provided by the Contractor (that are accepted by the Contracting Officer) and to perform other work as ordered by CBP;
9) Assist the Contracting Officer during the shipyard repair phase to ensure that the shipyard’s work with regard to engine/generator/transmission related systems is in compliance with the Contractor’s specifications and otherwise acceptable;
10) Upon completion of the shipyard’s work, the Contractor shall perform maintenance and repairs on the engines, transmissions, and generators themselves as ordered by the Contracting Officer (based on the Contractor’s recommendations) to restore operation and reliability to that expected given the quantity of engine hours on each item;
11) Perform comprehensive sea trials testing on the engines, transmissions, and generators once all repairs/modifications are complete (to include the “Performance Sea Trial for Delivery/Inspection” procedure discussed in the Caterpillar Marine Analyst Service Handbook). Perform additional tuning/calibration as necessary and retest the engines and generators for optimum performance; 
12) Review the current engine/generator systems operation/maintenance instructions prepared by BSY for the GCG and identify sections that are either incorrect or that have become obsolete. Prepare revisions to the documents for use by the GCG in the future; and
13) Inspect main engines, generators, and transmissions for proper operation approximately 6 months after completion of above work/vessel’s return to service.

The work is divided into 5 phases, with Phase I to be firm-fixed price and the remainder expected to be awarded on a Time & Materials basis. 

Ideally, CBP would like to have the repair work performed in Georgia or at a suitable facility nearby (in the interest of reducing costs) but all reasonable offers will be considered in an effort to obtain the work required to return this vessel to fully operational status. Partnering with firms in Georgia that have facilities and/or equipment needed for the work of this contract is suggested as a possible solution (Note: There is a shipyard in Poti, Georgia). Alternately, the Georgian Coast Guard will permit repairs to be performed on their base at Poti if desired but the successful Contractor will have to provide its own tools/equipment/etc.

Domestic (i.e., US) firms must be registered at www.ccr.gov and have ACTIVE status to be eligible for contract award. Payments made to a domestic contractor will be electronic and issued to the bank of record listed in their CCR registration data. Foreign firms are strongly encouraged to register at www.ccr.gov.  Payments to foreign firms will be made via SWIFT.

Additional parts of the solicitation will be added via amendment in approximately 15 days. A second solidification will follow for additional work on the vessel (non-engine/non-generator work – see notice of 6/3/2008 concerning HSBP1008Q1811 and future notices regarding that acquisition).

<DESC>I.	Purpose:
The purpose of this Screening Information Request (SIR) is to seek competent and suitable sources for the subject project. Responses to the SIR will be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information will allow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offerors are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) which will evaluate each response received and make a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing.
II.	Scope of Project:
East Entrance & Corridor:
The project involves the saw cutting and removing of existing concrete sidewalk, installing a new reinforced concrete foundation and slab, and installation a new 3 sided aluminum cladding & glass storefront creating a small vestibule area. Installing a new 80 mil TPO single-ply, mechanically fastened roofing system fully warranted by the manufacturer on the new vestibule, and finishing out the vestibule interior surfaces.
This project also includes refurbishing the existing interior corridor by furring out a partial brick and a partial concrete wall, drywall, finish and paint, replacing an acoustical tile drop ceiling with a drywalled hard-lid ceiling, and treating some existing and new concrete floor by applying a concrete stain. Re-working some electrical circuits for lighting and HVAC, and installing a fan coil unit, thermostat, and related exposed duct work in the corridor and adjacent vestibule.
AAS Restrooms:
This project includes refurbishing the existing men's and women's two (2) stall AAS bathrooms by removing all plumbing and lighting fixtures, toilet partitions, accessories, counters, flooring, ceilings, grills, and wall surfaces to the bare studs. Install a new finished and painted drywall, floor & wall tile, plumbing fixtures, toilet partitions, accessories, counters and lighting. Re-work some electrical circuits for lighting and heating.
All work must be coordinated in order to maintain an operational facility. The total contract duration completion of the work shall be 75 calendar days.
Estimated contract price is from $100,000.00 - $200,000.00. 
Government contemplates award of a firm-fixed-price contract. Offerors must be a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business/8(a) as certified by the Small Business Administration.
III.	Evaluation Criteria:
Prospective offerors are required to submit a technical and business proposal as discussed herein. Proposals will be technically evaluated by the IPT as either "acceptable" or "not acceptable" on the basis of the following criteria:
(1)	Past Performance(2)	Management understanding and approach(3)	Qualifications of key personnel
Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable" in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration. One-on-One discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc.
IV.    Availability of Funds:
Funding for the entire subject project is not available at this time. The Government's obligation under the subject SIR is expressly contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds for each phase from which payment can be made. Offerors are hereby advised that no liability on the part of the Government shall arise for bid and proposal costs.
V.     Technical Proposal Content (Offerors are to provide 3 copies):
A prospective offeror must submit a complete technical and business proposal, which will encompass, but is not limited to, the content set forth herein. All technical and business proposal areas must be fully addressed. A negative response is required in the event of no experience for a particular area, or for any item that is not applicable. Any omission or partial and vague responses may lead to the rejection of the offeror's proposal without discussions with the offeror. The Government reserves the right to use and evaluate any and all available information pertinent to any offeror and its subcontractors, in addition to the data incorporated in the submitted technical and business proposals, and which may be related to performance periods beyond the last three (3) years.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one (1) OXYGEN ANALYSIS ADSORPTION EQUIPMENT.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Quantachrome Instruments Corporation. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition ofsupplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1.     Quantachrome Inc. is the only manufacturer of Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzed that can meet all of  the following operational system requirements necessary for thestudy needs of the active surface analysis of carbon fibers:a.	Built-in mass spectrometer utilizing high vacuum of analyzers oil-freeturbomolecular vacuum system (only one vacuum system necessary for   both the gassorption analyzer and the mass spectrometer). The built-in mass spectrometer is crucialfor quantifying the amount of CO vs. CO2 evolved from the sample as a function oftemperature. This is the essence of our research. b.	At least five pressure sensors positioned on analysis port and dosing manifold.The pressure sensor positioned on the analysis port provides the level of sensitivity werequire. This feature allows accurate analysis of smaller sample sizes.c.	Quench-solid Density Functional Theory for carbon pore size analysis includingeffects of surface heterogeneity. The QSDFT contained in the software package providedwith the Autosorb-1 series of instruments allows the most accurate pore sizecharacterization of the carbon samples that we will be analyzing.d.	Automatic coolant level control with dewar elevator and level sensor     (no cryogenic transfer required). Controlling, and minimizing, the amount of  thesample cell which is immersed in the cryogenic liquid provides	increased sensitivityversus systems which immerse the entire sample cell in cryogenic liquid. This feature isunique to the Autosorb-1 series of instruments and provides the level of sensitivity werequirewhen  performing surface area and pore size analysis of our samples.		    e.	  Separate port for continuous update of saturated equilibriumvapor pressure with each dose using dedicated pressure sensor (1000 torr). Monitoring thesaturated equilibrium vapor pressure throughout the  analysis ensures an accurate measureof the relative pressure for each data point. Having a dedicated transducer for this purpose, allows theautosorb-1 series of instruments to measure the saturated equilibrium pressurecontinuously without inter-erupting the analysis, allowing for a faster analysis with thehighest level of accuracy."The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 16, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

It is a versatile automated colony picker in a space-saving bench-top format.  Colonies are imaged by an on-board CCD camera and picked at a rate of up to 4,600 colonies per hour.  The fully enclosed system with UV sterilization ensures an ultra-clean environment, while the high-pressure wash station eliminates carry-over.  The intuitive software allows maximum flexibility over colony selection criteria, gridding patterns and library management.  Genetix provided the initial implementation of the instrument and therefore are uniquely qualified to provide the necessary care.  An equally important component of this instrument is the superior maintenance support.  The period of performance is a total of 12 months. The vendor will provide the following services:

•	Travel to the location to carry out remedial or preventative maintenance and guarantees to cover the equipment for parts.  Labor and travel for 12 months.
•	If case of product malfunction the contractor will have its representative at the location within 3 working days and will use all reasonable measures to repair the malfunction at the location, but if that is not practicable the contractor’s representative will seek to make alternate arrangements with the customer for: 
	•	A further visit to be made to the location during the customers normal business hours for the repair of the malfunction or
	•	If the equipment is inoperative as a result of the malfunction, its repair at the location outside of the customers normal business hours or
	•	If it is not practical to repair the malfunction, the removal of the equipment (or the part of the equipment in question) for purposes of repair.
•	Provide unlimited software support via telephone or email.  Telephone support shall be available during normal business hours.
•	The contractor will use all reasonable endeavors to perform routine maintenance on the equipment at six-month intervals and provide current version software upgrades free of charge.

•	If the contractor fails to achieve the target response time of 3 working days, for each day over the 3 days, one extra day will be added to the termination date of the agreement.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Genetix is the sole source manufacturer of this system and as such are the only ones that can provide the necessary technical support.  The parts are unique to this instrument and can not be substituted by other vendor parts.  The engineers from Genetix have the in-depth knowledge and training to repair this complex machine.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS code 541620:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. . Ryan Boyles of the University of North Carolina State. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allowsfor negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.PART I ? BACKGROUNDThe US EPA ORD Global Change Research Program researches and assesses the impacts of changing climate, as well as shifts in the drivers of global change, including land-use, national/regional energy and transportation choices on US air quality.  The body of climate change research indicates that a warming climate will manifest, not as a simple, across-the-board increase in temperature, but as changing synoptic-scale meteorological patterns.  Modeling studies supported by the EPA GCRP have shown that the primary impacts of a warming climate on air quality will be tied to changing synoptic-scale weather patterns.  
	Meteorology has a well understood role in determining air quality.  For example, high ambient O3 concentrations are typically associated with low wind speeds (stagnation), high solar radiation levels and warm temperatures.  In the case of PM, precipitation frequency is closely tied to ambient concentration.  For both PM and O3, inversion layer heights play a large role in local pollutant concentrations.  
State-level policy analysts and decision-makers concerned with air quality are in need of policy evaluation tools that consider information about projected local and regional air quality responses to climate change.  (cf. NRMRL Adaptation Workshop report, 2008)  Such a policy evaluation tool should be constructed on the basis of a general framework (or platform) that can be tuned to fit a particular state or region by the incorporation of AQ sensitivity details characteristic of the area, along projected changes in regional meteorological patterns.  Such a framework will allow all users to benefit from future improvements.
The purpose of this sole source purchase order is the acquisition analysis services for EPA?s Global Change Research Program in the Office of Research and Development.  The analyses to be obtained will support the development of an air quality management planning tool that estimates the future impacts on air quality of changing climate at urban (MSA) scales.   The State of North Carolina will serve as the test case for developing the methodology that will serve as the foundation for the air quality planning tool.
	The first phase in the development of the methodology involves identification of the meteorological patterns to which AQ is most sensitive in the test case region.  These patterns can serve as a "basis set" from which future meteorological dynamics can be projected using regional climate modeling outputs.  This first phase will yield necessary insight into the best methodologies for use in the design of the generalized tool framework.  
	To construct the meteorological and air quality baseline, the following relationships will be analyzed and linked to a geospatial grid that will be compatible with those used in meteorology and air quality modeling:
	Current and historical statistical relationships of local air quality observations to local climate observations, including individual meteorological variables	Identification of current and historical meteorological patterns characteristic of the test case region	Construction of a geophysical/numerical model linking site-specific North Carolina air quality responses to the meteorological patterns characteristic of the North Carolina region
	The work proposed here will yield the dataset required to establish the first of these relationships -- a geospatially and temporally consistent set of local air quality and local climate/meteorological observations for North Carolina.

PART II - JUSTIFICATION
	The work to be performed under this Purchase Request requires access to and expert knowledge of the climate, meteorological and air quality data for North Carolina and the US Southeast region, and substantial experience in the analysis of these data.
	FAR 6.302-1 authorizes contract actions when the agency?s need for the supplies or services required by the Agency are available from only one responsible source and that no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the Government?s needs.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).
	The responsible source identified for this task order, Dr. Ryan Boyles, has a unique set of capabilities and resources which make him well-suited to meet the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Boyles has served in the North Carolina Climate Office, first as a meteorologist, then as Assistant Director from 2001 to 2006, assuming directorship of the State Climate Office in 2006.  As the North Carolina State Climatologist, and director of the North Carolina State Climate Office, Dr. Boyles is particularly well-qualified as both an expert in the field and a senior investigator with peer-reviewed publications on the analysis of the state's climate and meteorological patterns.  Furthermore, in his capacity as director of the NC State Climate Office, Dr. Boyles manages database containing data that is not available in national data repositories, e.g. solar radiation, soil temperature and moisture for the state of North Carolina.  He and his staff possess the knowledge and experience required to obtain and assess the specified data, and to perform the analyses specified in the statement of work. 

	Dr. Boyles has conducted, or directed, a wide variety of meteorological and climate change analyses for North Carolina. He has been involved in several projects in areas pertinent to the analyses specified in the statement of work, including applied meteorology and climatology, Geographic Information Systems, spatial analysis, and applied statistics.  To illustrate the level of experience and expertise he possesses in the area of scientific and technical writing and editing, the following is a list of publication he has produced specifically related to the analysis of meteorological, land surface and climatological data:

PART III ? SCOPE OF WORK	Deliverable #1:		The contractor shall develop a quality assurance project plan (QAPP) for this project for the project manager?s and quality assurance coordinator?s approval.  The QAPP shall address the quality assurance/quality control for data analysis for this project.  (See Appendix A:    Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) for Data Analysis for: An Urban-scale AQ Planning Tool for Global Change Adaptation -- Test Case Data Acquisition)	Deliverable #2:The contractor shall provide EPA with a temporally- and spatially-consistent, quality-controlled and assured dataset that contains high-quality atmospheric and land surface observations for the State of North Carolina, including but not limited to: 1)  Observed ambient ozone concentrations from the entire period of record for available monitoring locations in North Carolina
2)  Matching meteorological and land surface observations, including:* Dry bulb temperature* Relative humidity* Dew point temperature* Precipitation* Wind speed and direction* Solar radiation* Soil temperature* Soil moisture
	All observations are to be synchronized to maintain temporal consistency based on the documented times of observation.  Where possible, these observations should be co-located.  For sites without co-located air quality and climatological/meteorological observations, atmospheric variables from the nearest neighboring site or interpolated values based on surrounding climate observations will be used. Climate observations that are missing when ozone observations are available will be replaced using interpolated estimates from surrounding monitoring stations. All interpolated or adjusted data are to be flagged.  The contractor will flag data that are missing or are possibly unreliable.  The database will be provided to EPA in either SAS or R format.
	The development of the database will be staged to permit an intermediate evaluation of its format and content.  In the first stage (Deliverable #2a), complete, integrated datasets will be produced for two meteorologically distinct air quality monitoring sites and submitted for EPA evaluation.  The contractor will then complete the database (Deliverable #2b), as described above, accounting for feedback provided by EPA on the first stage deliverable.
Project TimelineDeliverable	Delivery Date1)  Quality Assurance Project Plan	Fifteen (15) days following contract award2a) Test datasets for two sites	Thirty (30) days following contract award2b) Complete dataset, as specified above     	Sixty (60) days from receipt of EPA comments on Deliverable #1This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation, to martinez.thomas@epa.gov, phone number (202)564-1418, which establishes that their specifications meet EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by EPA. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS code 541620:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr.Semazzi of the University of North Carolina State. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows fornegotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source. PART I ? BACKGROUNDThe US EPA ORD Global Change Research Program researches and assesses the impacts of changing climate, as well as shifts in the drivers of global change, including land-use, national/regional energy and transportation choices on US air quality.  The body of climate change research indicates that a warming climate will manifest, not as a simple, across-the-board increase in temperature, but as changing synoptic-scale meteorological patterns.  Modeling studies supported by the EPA GCRP have shown that the primary impacts of a warming climate on air quality will be tied to changing synoptic-scale weather patterns.  
	Meteorology has a well understood role in determining air quality.  For example, high ambient O3 concentrations are typically associated with low wind speeds (stagnation), high solar radiation levels and warm temperatures.  In the case of PM, precipitation frequency is closely tied to ambient concentration.  For both PM and O3, inversion layer heights play a large role in local pollutant concentrations.  
State-level policy analysts and decision-makers concerned with air quality are in need of policy evaluation tools that consider information about projected local and regional air quality responses to climate change.  (cf. NRMRL Adaptation Workshop report, 2008)  Such a policy evaluation tool should be constructed on the basis of a general framework (or platform) that can be tuned to fit a particular state or region by the incorporation of AQ sensitivity details characteristic of the area, along projected changes in regional meteorological patterns.  Such a framework will allow all users to benefit from future improvements.
The purpose of this sole source purchase order is the acquisition analysis services for EPA?s Global Change Research Program in the Office of Research and Development.  The analyses to be obtained will support of the development of an air quality management planning tool that estimates the future impacts on air quality of changing climate at urban (MSA) scales.   The State of North Carolina will serve as the test case for developing the methodology that will serve as the foundation for the air quality planning tool.
	The first phase in the development of the methodology involves identification of the meteorological patterns to which AQ is most sensitive in the test case region.  These patterns can serve as a "basis set" from which future meteorological dynamics can be projected using regional climate modeling outputs.  This first phase will yield necessary insight into the best methodologies for use in the design of the generalized tool framework.  
	To construct the meteorological and air quality baseline, the following relationships will be analyzed and linked to a geospatial grid that will be compatible with those used in meteorology and air quality modeling:
	Current and historical statistical relationships of local air quality observations to local climate observations, including individual meteorological variables	Identification of current and historical meteorological patterns characteristic of the test case region	Construction of a geophysical/numerical model linking site-specific North Carolina air quality responses to the meteorological patterns characteristic of the North Carolina region
	The work proposed here will address the second need ? identification of the primary climate/meteorological patterns present in the North Carolina region.
The Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) method as implemented by Bowden & Semazzi (2008 & references therein) on the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR, 1979- present; www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/rreanl) dataset to derive time series and homogeneous patterns of the climate indices that summarize the behavior of the climate system of North Carolina.  The region of analysis will encompass sufficient land surface and ocean area to ensure an accurate resulting description of North Carolina?s climatology.	Each EOF comprises a spatial geographical pattern (fixed in time) and the corresponding time series. However, typically there are only about 3 or 4 EOFs for each analysis that are statistically significant. The rest are considered to be associated with incoherent noise due to observational and data analysis deficiencies. So in practice we will generate three or four maps and time series for each meteorological variable. The interpretation of a specific EOF is that its contribution to the original value of the analysis variable (e.g. surface temperature at a grid point near Raleigh) is obtained by multiplying the value of the EOF on the map at the location of interest by the value of the corresponding EOF time series for a particular year, say 1985. The original value of the NARR data at the grid point may be recovered by summing the contributions of all the EOFs.
PART II - JUSTIFICATION
	The work to be performed under this Purchase Request requires expert knowledge of the application of statistical analysis techniques to climatological/meteorological data, and substantial experience in the application of these techniques to the data and modeling outputs for North Carolina and the surrounding region.  In particular, the contractor secured to complete the project described below must have specific expertise in the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analytical technique.  EPA has determined that the EOF methodology is the statistical approach best suited for identifying the characteristic climatological/meteorological patterns of importance to air quality, as described above.  
	FAR 6.302-1 authorizes contract actions when the agency?s need for the supplies or services required by the Agency are available from only one responsible source and that no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the Government?s needs.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).
	The responsible source identified for this task order, Dr. Fredrick Semazzi, has a unique set of capabilities and resources which make him well-suited to meet the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Semazzi and his research group have made extensive use of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) methods and observational data from multiple data sources, including NOAA NCEP, gridded data, and satellite data over the eastern region of the US, in their studies of Atlantic storm systems impacting North Carolina and the US Southeast.  Their statistical and modeling results are being used to run a flooding model for North Carolina and the US Southeast.  This research requires a unique combination of statistical and regional climate modeling expertise for the eastern region of US and close working relations with the regional weather/climate organizations and programs, including North Carolina Climate Office (NCCO).  
	The following list of peer-reviewed publications supports the conclusion that Dr. Semazzi and his research group have a broad base of experience in regional climate modeling and analysis, in addition to their specific experience with the techniques and data required to complete the project:1.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS code 541620:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Exponent of Washington, DC. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full andopen competition if there is only one responsible source. STATEMENT OF WORKTitle:	Analysis of NHANES Data to Estimate Long-Term Fish Intake RatesPeriod of Performance:		Award to January 31, 2009I.  BACKGROUNDEnvironmental pollutants can accumulate in fish tissue.  Consequently, intake of fish can be a potential pathway of human exposure to these contaminants.  Estimating exposure to toxic chemicals among fish-consuming populations requires knowledge about intake rates of fish and shellfish.  Risk assessors need reliable intake data to more accurately estimate exposures to fish consuming populations.  In some cases, risk assessors are able to conduct a site-specific survey to get consumption rates that are more representative of the area of concern.  However, site-specific surveys cannot be conducted in every case due to time and resource constraints.  More often, risk assessors need to use surrogate data from other water bodies to estimate consumption in the water body of interest.  
Data on fish consumption rates come from various sources.  The Exposure Factors Handbook, published in 1997, provides a summary of the available data from various fish consumption surveys (U.S. EPA, 1997).  Several key studies presented in the Handbook derive fish consumption rates using data on the amount of fish eaten during a short period of time, e.g., 24 hours.  Consumption rates based on short testing periods provide information on consumption over the specified period, but should be used with caution when chronic exposures are of interest.  Extrapolating short term data to derive long-term consumption rates adds uncertainty to the estimates due to the intra-individual variation of consumption from day to day.  Information on consumption over multiple days is recommended to reduce intra-individual variability and derive more accurate estimates of consumption (OEHHA, 2001). 
Since the Exposure Factors Handbook was published, additional data on fish consumption behaviors have become available.  For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has collected data on dietary intake, including intake of fish and shellfish since 1999.  This survey provides more recent data that can be used to estimate short-tem intake, but has also collected information on the frequency of fish intake over a 30-day period that may be able to be used to estimate long-term intake rates for fish.  
Tran et al. (2004), combined food frequency information from NHANES for 1999-2000 with dietary recall data from the Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) for 1994-1996/1998, using a probabilistic approach to generate estimates of chronic average daily intake.  In the approach described by Tran et al. (2004), 249 CSFII food codes were mapped into 28 NHANES fish and shellfish categories; for each of these NHANES categories, a weighted distribution of amounts consumed per eating occasion was generated from CSFII intake records.  Long-term (30-day average) daily fish/shellfish intake rates were then derived by combining randomly sampled NHANES individual records of fish/shellfish frequency of consumption with amounts consumed at each eating occasion randomly sampled from the CSFII intake distribution.	II.  PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Work Assignment is to update the previous study results described by Tran et al. (2004) with the most recent NHANES dietary recall data (i.e., to replace the CSFII data previously used), and food frequency data (i.e., including data collected since 2000).  Available NHANES data from several years (i.e., beginning with 1999 data) shall be combined in order to increase the sample size of the data.  The analysis shall be performed to estimate 24-hour intake rates and 30-day intake rates for all fish, all shellfish, and all fish and shellfish combined, as well as for individual fish/shellfish species, as practicable (i.e., depending on samples sizes). The analysis shall be conducted for both adult women and children, using the age categories suggested in EPA?s Guidance on Selecting Age Groups for Monitoring and Assessing Childhood Exposures to Environmental Contaminants (U.S. EPA, 2005), to the extent practicable (i.e., considering that a sufficient number of observations will be needed in each age category to be statistically relevant, fine age categories may not be possible). Further, the analysis shall include fish and shellfish intake rates calculated for both ?consumers only? and ?per capita.? 
The product of this analysis shall be a report that provides a detailed description of the data and methodology used in the analysis, and a comprehensive set of results (including detailed data tables with statistical summaries of the data; e.g., means, standard deviations, percentiles, number of observations, etc).  In addition, the Contractor shall provide a draft manuscript for publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal.  The paper shall follow the guidelines for publication in a journal that is mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the EPA WAM and, in general, shall provide an abstract, introduction, detailed description of the methodology used to estimate long-term fish intake, results of the analysis, discussion of the key findings, and references used.  
III. Sole Source JustificationA sole source task order is being requested with Exponent, Washington DC.  Exponent conducted data analysis using earlier NHANES data and published a manuscript in 2004 with those results.  The present task is an expansion and update of the previous work conducted by Exponent.  It is in the best interest of the government to issue this task order to Exponent to avoid spending additional and unnecessary resources in bringing a new contractor up-to-speed on the details of this analysis.  IV.  TASKS, SCHEDULES AND DELIVERABLES
Task 1:  Preparation of Work Plan
A Work Plan will be due two weeks after the Work Assignment is issued.  This Work Plan shall include the following:
	Description of overall approach for preparing the report	Description of how secondary data and information, including QA issues, will be handled 	Level of effort	Staffing	Schedule for completion and submission of the internal review draft, external peer review draft, and final report.	
Task 2: Data Gathering
Within one month of EPA approval of the Work Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the appropriate NHANES survey data relating to 24-hour fish intake and fish consumption frequency in order to update the previous study results described by Tran et al. (2004).  The Contractor shall combine several years of NHANES data (i.e., all available data beginning with 1999) and use the USDA recipe file, as appropriate, to account for fish consumed in prepared food mixtures when estimating 24-hour fish intake rates. The Contractor shall explore the possibility of using additional age groups other than those described by Tran et al. (2004) to estimate long-term fish intake.  The age groups to be considered are those described in EPA?s Guidance on Selecting Age Groups for Monitoring and Assessing Childhood Exposures to Environmental Contaminants (U.S. EPA, 2005).  The Contractor shall also explore the possibility of providing intake data for individual fish species in addition to intake data for all fish and all fish and shellfish combined.   The Contractor shall hold a conference call with the EPA WAM and the EPA Alternate WAM to discuss the data gathering effort before conducting the analysis and preparing the draft document described in Task 3.
TASK 3: Conduct Analysis and Prepare Internal Review Draft Document
The Contractor shall perform the analysis using the probabilistic technique described in Tran et al (2004) and prepare a draft report within three months after the data gathering task (Task 2) has been completed.  The draft document shall update the previous fish intake results described by Tran et al. (2004) and serve as the Agency?s Internal Review Draft (IRD). In addition to the document, the Contractor shall provide electronic copies of the report and all spreadsheet files used in providing statistical summaries of the data.  EPA will review and comment on the IRD document. 
TASK 4: Preparation of External Review Draft Document
Within three weeks of receiving EPA comments, the Contractor shall modify the IRD as directed by the EPA WAM, to produce the External Review Draft (ERD).  The ERD will be reviewed by expert external peer reviewers under a separate contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Procurement of services to design and develop a System Integration Lab (SIL) used for M1A1 Abrams Tank Embedded Diagnostics (ED).  This procurement is sole-source to DRS Test & Energy Management, LLC (DRS-TEM), 110 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL because the Government does not possess technical data adequate for competition.  The SIL will require unique characteristics specific to the DRS-TEM facility and to DRS-TEMs performance of their ED System Technical Support (STS) effort.  The SIL must correctly and accurately simulate the interaction between to the M1A1s line replaceable units (LRUs) and other vehicle components (including DRS-TEM proprietary ED hardware and associated software).  The contractor must have the requisite knowledge of the diagnostic systems of Abrams Tank ED to properly build a SIL that will interact with existing ED proprietary hardware and software while fully integrating those capabilities and functions into its initial design.  Much of the ED hardware technical documentation required is proprietary to DRS-TEM.  Offers from concerns other than the above are not solicited.  However, proposals from responsible sources shall be considered.

<DESC><BR><BR>The U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command and Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM LCMC) Acquisition Center  Washington, on behalf of the Software Engineering Center, Belvoir (SEC-B) Centralized Acquisition and License Management (CALM) team, plans to award a contract on a sole-source basis to FrontRange Solutions, Incorporated for Heat Maintenance.  Heat is required by the Project Manager, Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (PM-WIN-T) Joint Network Node (JNN) software baseline, located at Fort Monmouth, NJ.  No other network management programs were found that could meet the Governments requirements.  The requirement for a particular brand name item precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The required software maintenance is sold only by the manufacturer, FrontRange Solutions, Inc.  Heat is a near real-time trouble-ticket and system monitor software tool and provides network management and control on a Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN).  It allows an organization to check and confirm the health of mission-critical networks, systems, and applications, while providing support and trouble-ticket escalation across the total organization network.  In order to obtain information superiority, the current tactical communications systems must be capable of high mobility as well as joint and strategic interoperability.  To gain this interoperability, modernized communications teams must use like equipment or compatible government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment found in the Global Information Grid infrastructure, while maintaining tactical mobility.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully perform the effort may submit a quote that shall be considered by the Agency.  The resultant contract will be a three-year Firm-Fixed Price (FPP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for up to $18M.  The RFP will be posted at the CECOM LCMC Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP) https://abop.monmouth..army.mil.  Interested parties will be required to register for user ID and password in order to access the webpage.  Please contact the IBOP help desk, toll free, at 1-888-414-6277 for any technical assistance.  Responses are to be received via email within 15 calendar days of the date of this notice, by 2:30 PM local time.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  You may forward all responses to the following e-mail address:  mary.roebuck@us.army.mil.  See NOTE 22.<BR>

<DESC>The Government intends to award a Sole Source contract to Johns Hopkins University. The technician will work in the John Hopkins Medicine/Neurology/Brain Injury Outcomes within the Research Service of VAMHCS.  The duty station is Baltimore.  The  study nurse is responsible for capturing all workload through the completion of an encounter form in a timely manner.  Independently performs standard examinations and schedules patients for examinations.  Evaluates the nature of critical and emergency procedures, and rearranges patients scheduled to accommodate them.  Maintains records of patients examined.  Cross-indexes interesting cases for teaching purposes.The contractor (Johns Hopkins University-School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland with Dr. Daniel Hanley and Dr. Macko) will work in the VA Center of NeuroRehabilitation Excellence. The duty station is VA Baltimore. The contract is to identify Neuromuscular and cortical mechanisms of functional performance leading to adaptive modes of recovery after stroke and other disabling neurologic conditions including Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinsons disease. This contract provides continuation of services for a previous research project with Johns Hopkins University which was under the previous award for a follow-up on appropriate tests of Neuroplasticity in research protocols aimed at assessing treadmill and Roboyic interventions applied to stroke, MS and Parkinsons patients. Therefore due to the continuity of the research, the requirements are deemed to be available only from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, therefore it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.

<p>The 412 Electronic Warfare Group (EWG), Edwards AFB, CA, is seeking vendors that specialize in video recording equipment. This recording system will be used for recording video from environmental simulations within the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF). The video recording system will need to record up to eight (8) video feeds during test execution and properly handle both unclassified and classified video. All eight (8) recorders must be controllable and synchronized through an easy to use user interface that controls at a minimum basic video functions (play/stop/rewind/forward/pause/record). It must also have the capability to synchronize all eight (8) video sources together for playback regardless of resolution and frame rate of the source. Each recorder must store up to 10 hours of continuous video which equates to over 80 hours of video per day. The recorders must also have selectable inputs to accommodate incoming video from (DVI) or VGA high-resolution sources, S-video, and composite video sources. Input devices will consist of video cameras, spectrum analyzers and other test equipment, and aircraft avionics equipment. Feeds will be up/down converted and connected to the recorder by DVI or S-Video using off the shelf components. The system must be able to record at a resolution of 1280x1024 pixels, the standard resolution for a computer monitor. Recorders should provide for full-resolution recording at rates up to 30 frames per second (fps), and should allow for user selection of reduced recording rates. The system should provide for time stamp of video frames, based on an external IRIG-B source, either as a video overlay, an embedded digital time stamp, or both. A video back up system must also be present for both redundancy and archiving purposes. The video backup system needs to protect against video recorder failure and storage failure. The backup system needs to be reliable and provide high quality video with minimal loss.<br />In the end, two sources of video will have been created: The primary source, which will be used for achieving and backup and the secondary sources which will be delivered to the customer. The material being handed over needs to be viewable using a commonly available codec and Windows PC based video player (Windows Media Player). Software should accompany the video that allows users to sync up multiple feeds and step through the videos simultaneously. Editing tools that allow for video editing and clip extraction should also be available to the user that takes advantage of the embedded or overlaid IRIG time.</p>

UTILIZATION AND FUNCTIONALITY OF INTEGRATION MEASUREMENT SYSTEM WITHIN THE ELECTRONIC WARFARE GROUP (EWG) LISTED BELOW: 

A.  The Integrated Measurement System is designed to be a medium range zone imaging system. The measurement system is powered by a Portable Imaging System.  The radar employs a single channel receiver that is configured to operate in one of the three software selectable frequency bands.  Each frequency band is configured independently and user-definable setups are available for saving all radar settings.  These system setup files can be recalled to automatically configure the radar.  This system supports sub-band frequency sweeps that are optimal for the fastest possible measurements.  The system incorporates hi-speed RF switches and RF attenuators that will allow for multiple frequency sweeps “on the fly”.  The Integrated Measurement System also includes antennas, Rail, supporting mounts and lifts, calibration targets sets, a video/Laser/tilt module, a position data system and shipping containers.


 B.   The data for microwave images are acquired by moving the antennas on a motorized linear rail while triggering data sweeps incrementally along the rail. The center of the microwave image is called the zone center. The typical zone centers for medium ranges are from 15 to 24 feet in front of the antennas. Greater distances can be achieved depending on the details of the RF environment, instrument settings and target. The system is calibrated by using a known standard with precise magnitude and phase responses associated with each frequency and polarization. The system is on a physical support structure to allow it to be positioned such that the zone center is located at a specific location on the aircraft or target. The structure provides manual movement in x, y, z (height) and azimuth. The antenna pitch (elevation) is manually operated for 2-18 GHz antennas.  The antennas are aligned with a Position Data System using the aircraft coordinate system-fuselage station (FS), buttline (BL) and waterline (BL). The position algorithm determines the antenna movement required to align to the desired zone center on the aircraft.  The Radar Subsystem, Control Interface and the PDS System could operate under as well as on top of the aircraft with Band3 antennas [2 to 18 GHz]. The Computer/Controller Rack and Power Rack are always outside the aircraft shadow line. The design of the hardware includes circular locking military connectors, drip loops on the cables and no direct top openings for fuel to enter the electronics. The cooling fans and exhaust vents are IP54 rated. Sealed switches and sealed relays are used so no sparks generating situations occur during operation.  Most metal parts are Powder Coated or coated for anti-corrosion. Some exposed materials may be galvanized steel, stainless steel and aluminum.

C.  What is it used for?  One of the main intended uses of the Imaging System is to speed up chamber Characterization for each test range design prior to performing each customer test.  One of the major capabilities of the integrated measurement system is its lower frequency range, down to 100MHz, which will improve our range design and characterization proficiency.  This system will at least reduce our chamber characterization time by 50%.

<DESC>The overall objective of this RFI is to make the screening process for laptops more efficient for both passengers and TSOs.  TSA is seeking prototype laptop computer bags and designs that would reduce, if not eliminate altogether, the unloading and repacking time of laptops at security checkpoints in airports.  Specifically, TSA would like industry to create bag designs that would allow passengers to not remove their laptops from carry-on bags for security screening.  By allowing passengers to keep their laptops in their computer or carry-on bags, TSA can further reduce wait times at the checkpoint and improve the overall passenger security experience. Please see the attached Request for Information for deails and submission instructions.

<a href="mailto:janis.r.steiner@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>Market survey for standardized medium voltage gas-insulated switchgear.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, is conducting a market survey to identify sources and to increase competition acquisition opportunities for Standardized Medium Voltage Gas-Insulated Switchgear.  This request is only a market survey, not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  It is for information only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or announcement of a solicitation.  The purpose of this Sources Sought request is to obtain information on medium voltage gas-insulated switchgear offering full compatibility and interoperability with existing the Siemens AG Type 8DA10 switchgear at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN.  In the interest of safety and efficiency, AEDC is standardizing the medium voltage gas-insulated switchgear used throughout the installation.<BR><BR>The use of the Siemens AG Type 8DA10 medium voltage gas-insulated switchgear is essential to the government's requirement, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Commonality of the medium voltage switchgear in the plants running AEDC test cells is a must. In FY07 under a competitive procurement, Siemens was selected to install the Type 8DA10 medium voltage gas-insulated switchgear in the Engine Test Facility C Air Side Plant.  <BR><BR>Although gas-insulated switchgear provides required improvements in safety, reliability, and life-cycle cost, it can require some maintenance or repair that can only be provided by a manufacturer-trained service representative.  AEDC purchased Type 8DA10 switchgear for ETF-C facility in Fiscal Year 2007 and intends to establish a service contract for that switchgear when it is placed in service.  By purchasing the Type 8DA10 switchgear for TEDAC, the service contract for the ETF would also be used for the TEDAC switchgear.  This would reduce costs of having service contracts with multiple manufacturers. <BR><BR>Commonality of gas-insulated medium voltage switchgears ensures that spare parts are on-hand for emergency repair. If gas-insulated switchgear is purchased from multiple manufacturers, it will be necessary to maintain additional spare units for each switchgear type and size.  <BR><BR>Operators of the switchgear receive special training.  Each manufacturer provides special tools for operating the disconnect switch and locking the mechanisms into safe configurations.  There is no guarantee that the procedures for operation of switchgear made by one manufacturer will resemble the procedures of other manufacturers.  Operation errors would be less likely if all the switchgear was the same and the operation procedures were the same.<BR><BR>Modern switchgear systems are far more sophisticated than previous generations of the equipment.  An example of this complication can be seen in the size of the manual for a modern multi-function protective relay.  The Type 8DA10 switchgear that is being installed in ETF-C provides three multi-function relays per motor.  The manual for the relay with the median amount of complication contains 706 pages.  For every different type of switchgear that AEDC purchases, additional on-base technical staff will be required to troubleshoot motor operation problems.  Additional test equipment and procedures will also be required.<BR><BR>Test facility requirements change as new capabilities are added to support new test programs.  AEDC must maintain configuration control of the interfaces to the switchgear and understand the equipment to ensure that it is not operated beyond its capability.  Having only a single type of switchgear simplifies this task.  <BR><BR>The new switchgear shall be fully compatible with Siemens 8DA10 and shall comply with IEC 60694 and shall meet IEEE C37.20.2 except for differences related to fixed circuit breaker construction and isolated-phase bus arrangement.  Safe-to-touch hermetically sealed single pole enclosure of primary conductors insulated with sulfur hexafluoride gas.  Each feeder gas compartment shall be suitably divided into separate sections, which are isolated by gas-tight bushings.  The division of compartments shall take into account the effects of faults within the compartments such that in the event of an internal fault, a pressure relief device operates before internal pressure exceeds the design limit of the compartment.   The individual gas-sealed compartments shall be capable of being separately evacuated for inspection or maintenance, while keeping the adjacent compartments pressurized to rated pressure.  Leakage of gas from switchgear enclosures shall not exceed 0.5% of the gas per compartment per year.  Each gas compartment shall be provided with a pressure relief device to limit the pressure to a safe level in the event of an internal fault.  The pressure relief devices shall be designed such that discharges resulting from internal faults are directed away from locations where personnel may be present.   The preferred location for the bus bar pressure relief shall be such that gases are exhausted through the top of the enclosures.   All pressure relief device design shall be certified by an arc fault design test in accordance with IEC 60298 standards.   To isolate the circuit breaker and feeder from the system, a 3-phase, 3-position (Connected-Open-Ready-to-Ground) switch shall be utilized.   The 3-postion switches shall be located in each phase of the bus compartment such that when in the disconnected or grounded position, no live parts are accessible in the interrupter compartment when the main bus is energized.   Access to the 3-position switch operating mechanism shall be mechanically and electrically blocked with the circuit breaker is in the closed position to prevent misoperation.  It shall not be possible to switch directly from connected ground to grounded position.   A keyed selector shall prohibit simultaneous access to manual disconnect and grounding switch operators.  The operating mechanism shall be maintenance free without limitation up to 10,000 operating cycles with a design life of 30,000 cycles.  The vacuum interrupters shall be maintenance free up to their mechanical service life of 30,000 operating cycles.  <BR><BR>Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufacturers name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include necessary backup information and support documentation.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of publication of this notice.     <BR><BR>The government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  This is not a request for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be faxed to 251-441-6510, Attn:  Liz Cotton Responses are required fourteen (14) days after publication of this notice.  <BR><BR>Responses should be addressed to:  U S Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District	<BR>				          Attn:  CESAM-CT-C/Ms. Liz Cotton<BR>				          P.

Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price quote submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. All email communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.    After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any    misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.   <BR><BR>2.

Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes (some of the sizes above within each product line may be similar or not applicable due to the item being available as a universal (one size fits all) category) and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Orthopedic Soft Goods- Ankle product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)

Vendors must provide contact information (Name, phone number, and e-mail address) for a local vendor representative in the Europe Region in response to this RFQ.<BR>5.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>6.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>7.

Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Ankle products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ.  Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>9.	Vendors, in response to this RFQ, must provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe.<BR>10.	Vendors must provide documentation of what type of securement devices your company uses for your ankle orthopedic soft goods in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.

Vendors must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation explaining any products (i.e. walking boot and cam walker) with the added features of being static (allowing no range of motion) or dynamic (adjustable hinge capable of locking the body part in plantar flexion or dorsiflexion).<BR>14.	Vendors must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation that your products are designed to be worn over or under clothing.<BR>15.	Vendors must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ.  Samples required for this evaluation will be furnished by vendors at no charge.  <BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR>1. Patient Safety - Product is durable.<BR>a. A splint or brace for the lower extremity needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with weight bearing and patient mobility.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Comfort - Product is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of time the device will need to be applied.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>3. Proper Fit - Product has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. This feature will allow proper fit to stabilize injured or diseased body<BR>                    part.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort - Product has features to provide comfort to user.<BR>		a. The CPT will be looking for the different kinds of padding offered to 			allow for patient comfort.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will don the product, confirming the comfort of the item is acceptable.		<BR>5. Patient Safety - Product provides stability.<BR>a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body part from further injury.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of the item is acceptable.		<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.<BR>

<DESC>The Smithsonian Institution is seeking companies or firms that can furnish implement and assist in executing an indefinite Quantity/Job Order Contract (IQC/JOC) automated system.  The object of the system would be to enable the Smithsonian Institution to rapidly engage contractors to perform construction (repairs and alterations), maintenance, and construction related services.  Achieving timely and cost effective procurement of maintenance and construction services is one of the most difficult and challenging facility related tasks facing the Smithsonian Institution. Complying with the standard procurement regulations required for traditional construction services contracts, combined with the necessary technical component of defining the requirements (i.e., architectural and engineering drawings and specifications) for seeking proposals makes it difficult to be responsive to facility users in a timely manner. This has created a need for the Smithsonian Institution to have a more responsive contracting technique for the accomplishment of maintenance, repair and minor construction projects. The Contractors shall develop and maintain a Catalog or Unit Price Book that contains individual construction tasks for all aspects of maintenance, repair and construction of facilities, roads, parking lots, security requirements, Smithsonian Institution specific items, and many other related components. The Contractor shall further provide training and support to the Smithsonian Institution personnel and contractors for the implementation and success of the IQC/JOC system for the Smithsonian Institution. This system would be implemented for work potentially at the following designated locations and associated facilities: 

•	Anacostia Community Museum - Washington, D.C.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to make a sole source award to Railinc Corporation, 7001 Weston Parkway, Suite 200, Cary, North Carolina, 27513-2125.  The resultant award is contemplated to be a fixed price type contract.  TSA requires a Security-Sensitive Materials (SSM) Location Reporting Tool in order to identify and locate, at any moment, the number and types of bulk rail shipments that contain SSM.  Immediate access to accurate SSM shipment data is critical to TSA’s ability to assess security risks to the freight rail network that are posed by SSM shipments.  The SSM Location Reporting Tool will allow TSA to maintain situation awareness and provide appropriate responses during heightened alert levels.

The resultant award will be for the continued development, customization, and operation of FreightScope, which is a rail car location data management system that was developed and marketed by Railinc Corporation.  FreightScope provides a Web-based, interactive dashboard of near-real-time rail shipment location information for North America.  Users can quickly determine the last reported location of SSM shipments (those controlled by Shortline and Regional railroads).  FreightScope quickly identifies SSM shipments for which no reports have been received during specified time periods.  It also produces, by certain geographic regions, breakdowns of Shortline and Regional railroad controlled SSM shipments.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Interested parties that believe they are capable of meeting these requirements shall send a one-page capabilities statement to Kerry Toscano via email at kerry.toscano@dhs.gov with the subject line "Security-Sensitive Materials (SSM) Location Reporting Tool" no later than 4PM EST on 25 June 2008.  All inquiries shall be submitted via email to Kerry Toscano by 25 June 2008.

NIU is the only contractor who can successfully perform this acquisition within the time contraints, because this project is a continuation of a previous effort between NHRC and NIU.  The contract is composed of two broad research projects. The first project, which is a longitudinal study that follows recruits from their entry into the United States Navy across multiple time points, is needed to determine the consequences of individual abuse victimization and perpetration on naval readiness. More specifically, this study will allow for estimations of the number of personnel with different types of abuse histories, will provide data indicating variables that are related to the occurrence of abusive behaviors, and will provide data regarding the outcomes of abuse histories. The second research project is an analysis of data derived from gender-specific sexual assault intervention programs for United States Navy men and women. The data from this second project will provide an estimate of the types and number of personnel that may profit from intervention/prevention programs. These studies are part of a series of studies whose goal is improving troop performance and readiness.  This is a 12 month effort.<BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

Only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1)  FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).   The cited authority is applicable because Gaven Industries provides RF shielding which has a unique, all-soldered construction for superior durability and reliable shielding efficiency.  Gaven Industries is the only vendor of which we are aware that provides a written life-time guarantee of the RF shielding performance.  This unique guarantee is possible because of Gaven’s unique all-soldered shielding design.   A market search was performed and Gaven was the only source which builds their RF shields with all-soldered panel connections ensuring that loss of conductivity will not occur over time and uses heavier gauge copper sheet metal in their panels.   Period of performance is approximately 5 months.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.   Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable source.

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia Public Announcement – for DDT Procurement


USAID/Ethiopia is considering an award of a sole source new contract to the Adami Tulu Pesticide Processing Share Company in Ethiopia in an amount of $2.65 million for the procurement of DDT. The award date will be o/a June 30, 2008.The purpose of this procurement is to support the Ethiopia’s National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), more specifically to support the indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Oromia Region. 

In Ethiopia the Malaria transmission is seasonal with two peak transmission seasons: the main transmission season is from September to November after the heavy rains and small transmission from May to June after the short rains. The RHB and FMOH representatives have raised their concern of the likelihood of malaria epidemics this year and requested USAID/Ethiopia to implement the IRS activities as soon as possible before the start of the main peak transmission season. Failure to support this activity in a timely fashion would, hence, undermine the standing, contribution and effort of the U.S. Government to the National Malaria Control Program in the country.

To the best of USAID Ethiopia knowledge, the Adami Tulu Pesticide Processing Share Company is the only factory that produces and supplies DDT 75% WDP and no other supplier is yet registered to import or produce DDT 75% WDP in the country
If you are interested and or know of any other potential sources, please submit a capability statement to caddis@usaid.gov with a copy to mcsow@usaid.gov or fasfawossen@usaid.gov  by 8:30AM, Addis Ababa time, June 19, 2007.USAID will consider and respond to all inputs received. Within capability statements, please provide your company name, a point of contact, address, contract email address phone number, and business size.

INTRODUCTION
The Office of HIV/AIDS Policy, under the Office of Public Health and Science, advises the Assistant Secretary for Health and senior U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials on: the appropriate and timely implementation and development of HIV/AIDS policy; the establishment of priorities; and the implementation of HIV/AIDS programs, activities, and initiatives across other HHS health agencies.

Reaching these goals will require all of us—including our families, friends, schools, faith-based organizations, and communities—to take on the responsibility of fighting HIV/AIDS. In particular, our attitudes—about those most at-risk for HIV and those living with HIV—must be free of negative perceptions and stigma.

OHAP manages initiatives to promote HHS policies, programs, and resources:

•  National HIV Testing Mobilization Campaign—engaging communities in HIV testing. 
•  AIDS.gov—providing a portal to federal domestic HIV/AIDS information.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to answer Contractor question.
<p>I just noticed the change in the sports officials contract. Since it went from 2 to 1 scorekeeper per game, should the estimated amount of games change also or does it not matter. It has the estimated amount of games for the scorekeeper as 575 and for the officilas as 250.</p>
<p>No, it should read "Scorer/Field Supervisor" and the games count of 250 is correct.</p>

<DESC><p>The following questions have been asked and the answers are as follows:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Q:&nbsp; Do you have a phone number/line that is currently being utilized for the service requested. We need this information to determine if service is currently available at the location requested, or if a line will have to be installed.</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; First, we currently do not have commercial internet here at JCSE. That is what I am trying to procure. So, therefore, I don't have a phone number associated with a service I don't have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Q:&nbsp; Do you have a commercial phone number for any area within the building requiring the service.</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; It will be going in our Network Control Center. A good phone number for that area is 813-828-0550.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Q:&nbsp; Industry may need to know if the vendor will need to provide its own equipment or if the router will be GFE (Government Furnished Equipment)...</p>
<p>Also, when the vendor delivers the circuit to the AFB- is the vendor required to deliver the circuit to a certain telecom drop off building and the BaseComm folks run the rest to the requested building which is 8532 Marina Bay Drive, Mac Dill, AFB</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Will the telecom provider need to run it completely to requested address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A:&nbsp; No government provided equipment. The vendor will have to supply everything.<br /><br />The circuit will not go through the base comm squadron. It will go directly to JCSE, 8532 Marina Bay Drive, Bld 861.</p>

In both the RFP and Questions/Reponses the Government has clearly outlined the requirement for, in addition to our technical response/technical capability, a separate Quality Control Plan, Transition Plan, and Quality Management System/Plan.

<p>Response: 11 x 17 fold-outs are counted as their size equivalent which would be 2 pages. The fold-outs may be used in any/all of the proposal volumes, but are still subject to that volume page count limitation.</p>
<p>3. Do cover sheets, table of contents, tab pages and/or section dividers, list of acronyms, provided for organization and clarification purposes and not to provide proposal content, count toward pages counts?</p>
<p>Response: No, these referenced documents will not count towards the volume page count limit if their sole intent is for organization and does not provide any proposal content.</p>
<p>4. The Government has stipulated the 12 point size for typing. May a smaller size font, still readable, be used in charts, tables, diagrams, graphs, and/or graphics?</p>
<p>Response: No, the 12 size font size is applicable to all documents provided.</p>

The primary data source for this analysis will be HEDIS results already in National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) HEDIS database that have undergone a HEDIS Compliance Audit. Additionally, the contractor will reach out to those health plans that do not currently report to the HEDIS database.  

HEDIS is a standardized measurement system that specifies how health plans collect, audit and report data on their performance in care and service areas ranging from child and adolescent immunization status, to helping patients control their cholesterol and enrollee satisfaction. In 1993, NCQA released HEDIS 2.0 that quickly became the “industry standard” performance measurement set. NCQA maintains and evolves HEDIS specifications and data collection protocols. Since 1997, Medicare, Medicaid and commercial HEDIS results from health plans have been collected on a nationwide basis by NCQA. Since its inception, NCQA has been a leader in health care quality assessment. NCQA operates as an independent, not-for-profit organization and does not represent the exclusive interests of any single constituency.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 to SN08-37
Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) Proposers’ Day

The purpose of amendment 1 to SN08-37 is to change the date, location, registration deadline of the Proposers’ Day and the description of Qualified Offerors/Proposers. The notice is replaced in its entirety with the following:

PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Workshop for the Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) program (BAA08-21) on 24 June 2008 at the Clarendon Ballroom, 3185 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22201, 8:30AM – 4:00PM. The purpose of this Conference is to provide information on the MAINGATE effort, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION  
The objective of the MAINGATE program is to develop the next generation Network Centric Radio System (NCRS) with additional capabilities and an assured affordable unit price to the user.  DARPA envisions two critical technologies for achieving these new goals:  1.) a backbone radio architecture that enables a versatile IP network and 2.) a radio gateway that enables legacy analog and digital communications systems to be internetworked.  As with NCRS, the MAINGATE will enable heterogeneous groups of radios to be integrated into a heterogeneous network tolerant to high latency and packet loss.  The technologies developed for the program will permit affordable, tactical, real-time, high fidelity video, data, and voice services to be deployed in a networked environment to support tactical operations in either maneuver or dismounted operations.  As a result of this effort, DARPA expects a clear demonstration of advanced mobile ad hoc network (MANET) gateway technology that will incorporate a Wireless IP-capable Network (WIPN), which provides interconnectivity between nodes bridging heterogeneous mixtures of radio networks.  A unique characteristic of the MAINGATE program is the integration of a “default” IP radio network as part of the gateway.  The program will be designed around a test-build-test philosophy through intermediate and final field evaluations, which will lead to Limited User Testing (LUT) by US and Allied Experimental Forces evaluating the effect of MAINGATE on new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) designed for the networked maneuver and dismounted forces.

MAINGATE will be a connection point that allows a multitude of users employing a heterogeneous set of radio technologies (both proprietary and non-proprietary) on different stub-nets to attach to and communicate through an IP Network.  The WIPN will provide the default high bandwidth connectivity among air and ground mobility platforms.  The network will include the integration of adaptive communications architecture, flexible routing architecture, and heterogeneous application services.  It is envisioned that a large fraction of the IP networking technology will be commercial or based upon commercial systems.  Only components and subsystems at an approximate maturity of Technical Readiness Level (TRL)-6 will be considered for entry into this effort.

Proposals to MAINGATE must address DoD specific and coalition radios and networks; commercial radios and networks; and relevant applications for seamless integration, as well as the capacity to attach to other IP networks (e.g. SATCOM) to provide both redundant and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) networking.  The output of this program will be a demonstrated suite of hardware and software components that can be configured for specific DoD, coalition, and first responders/public safety requirements. 

Details regarding the MAINGATE program will be presented at the Proposers’ Day meeting.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION 
Workshop Participants are requested to register not later than close of business (5:00 PM EDT)

The completed documents must be emailed to BAA08-21@darpa.mil not later than 19 June 2008.  Registration will be confirmed after receipt of the completed agreements and verification of proposer information.  The Proposers’ Day will be unclassified.

Note: Those who have submitted these forms under BAA08-21 to request program data need not resubmit these forms.  Only registration is needed for attendance.

Due to limited space please keep attendance to only those personnel required for appropriately representing your organizational purposes and goals.   It is requested that organizations limit attendance to three (3) personnel from each company location.  All attendees must be registered by their organizational representative.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  The attendance roster will be released at the conference. Individuals who do not wish to be included on the “released to all roster” must designate that request on the registration site. 

Additionally, companies that would like to present capability overviews during the conference, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain up to 4 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues). All presentation material must be approved in advance by the DARPA Program Manager.   Attendees desiring to reserve a time to present at the meeting should send the presentation in a PowerPoint or PDF electronic format not later than close of business (5:00 PM EDT) 19 June 2008 to BAA08-21@darpa.mil.

--- <h2>Correction</h2> – Synopsis Modification 7, Solicitation Section C, Paragraph 7.1.1.1.1(d) Aluminum foil per GG-P-455, Type 1, Class, Grade A, the thickness specification should be changed FROM  Thickness .005” +/- .0005”. TO  Thickness .003” +/- .0003”.  <br><br> 

(Note: The thickness is correct in the revised Attachment 1, Schedule of Items/Services and Prices.) <br><br><br>

--- <h2>Correction</h2> – Solicitation Paragraph F.3.1 - IUID Data Labels states that “The IUID Data Label delivery times shall fall within the delivery tiers shown in paragraph 7.2.1.8.”  This cross reference is incorrect and is hereby changed as follows: “The IUID Data Label delivery times shall fall within the delivery tiers shown in paragraph 7.2.1.11.” <br><br><br>

--- <h2>Change to Section M</h2> – The following note is added to the end of Section M, Paragraph M.4, Step 3 - Price/Rate: “NOTE: The Government reserves the right to normalize prices and calculate evaluated prices to ensure an equitable evaluation.”  <br><br><br>

QUESTIONS 1 through 16 were issued with previous synopsis modifications. <br><br>  


--- <h2>QUESTION 17:</h2>  Having standardized materials/options/pricing, [can you] please provide a set of example (maximum) length data item strings for use in producing sample labels per 7.1.1.5.1 for data items.<br><br>

-- Original Equipment Manufacturer’s CAGE <br>
-- Item Serial Number <br>
-- Original Part Number <br>
-- Nomenclature (human readable only) for each <br>
and per 7.1.2 examples <br>
-- Current Part Number<br>
-- AFEMS# .<br><br>
  
This will be helpful to the Government’s evaluation team comparing samples vis a vis marking methods proposed. [Can you] please advise?<br><br>

--- ANSWER 17:  All marking methods submitted shall be compliant with 2D Matrix marking quality standards established in MIL-STD 130N paragraph 5.2.7.2 Data Matrix symbol quality.  <br><br>
 
In general the CAGE will be 5 characters, serial numbers will not exceed 30 characters, part numbers will not exceed 32 characters, UIIs will not exceed 50 characters, and AFEMS numbers should not exceed 25 characters.  These are maximums and the actual numbers will generally have many fewer digits than allowed.  The vendors are expected to print according to industry standards.  Vendors are not expected to print information on labels that are too small to accept all the information contained in the imprint.  Ideally, the web-based interface will display an error message if the Government requestor tries to select a label size that is too small to for the amount of data submitted.<br><br><br>


--- <h2>QUESTION 18:</h2>  [The following question is restated from the original for clarification.]  The solicitation paragraph L.3.8.a. states that “The total price offered for IUID Data Labels will include: (1) the price of data labels, (2) the price of the processing and management service, (3) the price of the phone support, and (4) the price of all supporting and/or overhead costs associated with this product and its delivery (excluding actual direct shipping charges).  Should the prices of items (2), (3), and (4) be spread over the ceiling quantity of labels for each phase increment? 
<br><br>

--- ANSWER 18:  Offerors should spread the indirect and support costs over as many labels as they think feasible to provide a uniform price per label to the Government.  For additional clarity, Attachment 1 – Schedule of Items / Services and Prices has been amended to include a separate line item for each of these prices on a per label basis.  Using these line items is not mandatory since the per label prices for the web-based interface, phone support, and other costs will otherwise be included in the label prices; however, breaking out these prices by removing them from the per label price may help offerors represent their pricing and will facilitate price negotiations regarding these elements of price, should negotiations be necessary.   The prices entered in these three line items, for each phase increment, will be totaled and added to the price of each label in the corresponding phase increment to arrive at the total offered price. <br><br>  

Example – Label XX Phase 1 price $6.00 OR <br>
Label XX Phase 1 price $1.00 + interface price $3.00 + phone support price $1.50 + other overhead price $0.50. <br>
The evaluated price for Label XX Phase 1 is $6.00 in either case.<br><br><br>


--- <h2>QUESTION 19:</h2>  Minimum Order Price -- Supplier costs to setup, validate, verify, package and box each order for shipment are relatively fixed compared to the unit cost of the IUID labels that vary with quantity ordered. These costs, together with shipping, are much greater than a single IUID label’s price as requested per Attachment 1. When pricing for Attachment 1, Mgt Sheet should the minimum order price be added to the single unit label price? Or should the minimum order quantity price be listed separately at the bottom of the each time period column with the number of labels included in the fixed price per order? Or should the minimum be ignored for Attachment 1, Mgt. and listed separately? Please advise. <br><br>

--- ANSWER 19:  Label prices should NOT include a surcharge for minimum label quantity order requests.  The Government can not pre-determine the size of the order requests; therefore, a minimum quantity surcharge is not included in the evaluated price of the proposal, but the strategy will be evaluated as a technical factor.  Section L and M of the solicitation have been amended to include the following provisions for the evaluation of minimum quantity surcharge pricing. <br><br>

Add the following paragraph to Section L --<br><br>

L.3.7.l. – Minimum Order Request Surcharge – At the option of the offeror, the offeror may propose a price surcharge for minimum order requests.  If the offeror chooses to proposed a Minimum Order Request Surcharge, the offeror’s surcharge strategy shall be submitted with the technical proposal.  The strategy shall define what constitutes a minimum order request, i.e., single web-based interface request, all requests for a specific item within a 24 hour period, etc. and specify at what point the surcharge will be applied or above what quantity the surcharge will be removed.  The Minimum Order Request Surcharge strategy shall clearly spell out the amount of the surcharge and specify if the surcharge amount will be different for different materials or label configurations.   The proposed Minimum Order Request Surcharge strategy will be incorporated into the contract of the winning offeror.<br><br>

Add the following paragraph to Section M, under the heading -- M.2 - Step 1 - Evaluation of Technical Capability—<br><br>

Minimum Order Request Surcharge:  The Government will evaluate each offeror’s Minimum Order Request Surcharge Strategy to determine the degree to which the application of the surcharge will result in higher order prices on small quantity orders. <br><br><br>

--- <h2>QUESTION 20:</h2>  How should price variations be handled that are not accommodated by the solicitation Schedule of Items/Services and Prices? 
<br><br>

--- ANSWER 20:  Adjustments to the offered prices, either upward or downward, to accommodate variations in the product quality, composition, adhesive, or any other option offered in the technical proposal should be fully explained and will be evaluated as part of the technical evaluation.  Section L and M of the solicitation have been amended to include the following provisions for the evaluation of pricing adjustments. <br><br>

Add the following paragraph to Section L --<br><br>

L.3.7.m. – Price Adjustment Strategy – If the proposal includes a strategy for adjusting the offered prices, either for product quality, composition, adhesive, or any other technical options or for any other reason, that strategy must be clearly explained.  The price adjustment strategy will be evaluated along with the technical evaluation of the offered technical or business options.  The proposed price adjustments and the strategy for their application will be incorporated into the contract of the winning offeror. <br><br>

Add the following paragraph to Section M, under the heading -- M.2 - Step 1 - Evaluation of Technical Capability—<br><br>

Price Adjustment Strategy:  The Government will evaluate each offeror’s Price Adjustment Strategy to determine the degree to which the strategy equitably represents the technical or business options being offered. <br><br><br>

Offerors shall propose products adhering to these brand name or equal specifications for pricing purposes.  The use of these specifications for pricing does not limit the offeror from proposing additional materials with the ability to survive for the life expectancy of the item to which the label is attached as required by MIL-STD-130.  (For proposal purposes, assets items to be labeled with these three material types shall be presumed to have a 10 year life and be located in an indoor environment.)<br><br><br>

<DESC>The Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure by full and open competition an upgraded Critical Cockpit System (CCS) for the AH-1W aircraft. The overarching goal of this project is to meet the Blue Force Situational Awareness (BFSA) requirements.  The core control and display functions of the BFSA solution and current CCS functions must reside in the current physical locations of the Control Display Navigation Units and the Interface Control Units. To ensure these parameters are met, a site visit will take place on either May 6th or 7th from 7:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M, with the option for additional days to be added if required.  Each contractor will be allotted approximately two (2) to three (3) hours to view the aircraft. In addition the contractor will be provided a standard sheet of paper for any questions they might have. The questions will be recorded and answered via the following website: http://www.navair.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.  This site visit is highly encouraged  by the government. Early participation is encouraged as future site visits, if any, will be limited to maintain contract schedule and due to limited aircraft availability. Information for this visit must be received by 1 May to ensure you have access to the base (please fill out attachment 3). The only expected exception to these constraints is that the Government recognizes the BFSA requirement shall include accommodating an additional transceiver and its associated antenna system. The initial procurement will consist of six (6) systems with four (4) option periods to follow. The option quantities will range from 1-125 systems.   

A Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) and Draft copies of Attachment (1) Statement of Work for AH-1W Critical Cockpit Upgrade (CCU) Project and Attachment (2) Contract Data Requirements List package (Exhibit A001-D006) will be posted to the NAVAIR solicitation website at http://www.navair.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations. The purpose of releasing this draft RFP is to obtain industry feedback regarding the content of the draft RFP. If applicable, information will possibly be incorporated into the formal RFP, which will be released approximately 27June 2008. Proposals will be due approximately fifty (50) days after release of formal RFP. The Draft solicitation number is N00019-08-R-0050. Contract award is anticipated in FY09.  

NOTE: This program includes information that has been designated as “Distribution D” and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors. In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms. Some documents are under Federal export control for “sensitive” or “controlled” technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security. Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act. Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under by the U.S. Department website. http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.



To participate, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program. Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy, and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (0004) is to modify the last sentence in Topic (l).  
1.  The following topic is hereby modified:
Topic (l): "Heterojunction Bipolar Junction Transistor (HBT) Development Suitable for a Switching Device in a High Efficiency UHF Band (or higher frequency) Nonlinear Power Amplifier"
The optimum class-E switching device must exhibit both low R-ON (resistance through the field effect transistor drain-to-source channel) and high breakdown voltage (in terms of hundreds of volts, high for solid state devices) to function as a switch.  The bipolar switch theoretically suggests the most likely device capable of switching at the UHF rate.  The gallium nitride process, available in the first quarter of 2006, is ideal for class-E operation at the frequencies of interest.  An even better candidate in consideration for this application is the heterojunction bipolar transistor III-V device.  An academic partner with the appropriate facilities and expertise would work with NSWCDD Q22 to develop and manufacture novel III-V prototype devices capable of use at UHF,  500 watt RF output in a single device/package.
2.  This announcement will remain open and white papers will be accepted through 30 September 2008.

The contract type to be awarded will be a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with incentives to the responsive and responsible bidder offering the lowest price to the U.S. Government. The  tentative contract award date is July 31, 2008.   Proposed Work: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through it private drinking water supply well sampling program within the Newton County Mine Tailings Site, in Newton County, Missouri has identified over 500  shallow aquifer wells that exceed health based standards for heavy metals.  EPA is generally addressing this contamination through the installation of new public water supply mains throughout the site areas with identified contamination.   However, approximately 30 contaminated wells were identified at scattered locations making the installation of public water mains to these homes economically infeasible.  To address the metals contamination in wells at these homes, EPA will install a new deep drinking water supply wells into the lower, un-contaminated aquifer at each individual home with a contaminated shallow well.  All newly constructed deep wells shall be installed in accordance with the Missouri Well Construction Rules (Rules).  Additionally, the existing shallow wells on each property shall be abandoned in accordance with the Rules.  Both the well driller and the pump installer shall hold a non-restricted permit under the Missouri Well Construction Rules to perform work under this contract.  If both the well driller and pump installer are permitted under the same company, a Water Well Certification and Pump Installation Record (along with a copy of the chain of custody form for the lead and cadmium analysis) shall be submitted to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Geological Survey and Resource Assessment Division, Wellhead Protection Section for each well within 60 days of completion of pump installation.

<DESC>The United States Visitor and Immigrant Status
Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program
Request for Information/Sources Sought (RFI/SS) Announcement 
Biometric Land Exit Solution

1.0	Purpose 
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/ Sources Sought (SS) announcement to conduct market research. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this document. Information obtained is for planning purposes only. 
By means of this RFI/SS, the Government seeks to identify potential solutions, service providers, and suppliers interested in participating in the design and development of the Biometric Land Exit Solution for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is also asking for questions and/or feedback on the draft description of business needs; the characteristics of current facilities described in this document; suggestions for concepts of operation, technologies, and devices; and a broad outline of how the Government might provide the Biometric Land Exit Solution for land exit modalities by in-scope travelers at the northern and southern borders of the United States. 
A respondent to this RFI/SS should describe the technology and/or device(s) that can best be used to capture biographic and biometric information in a notional exit process and how the recommended approach will provide solutions for the needs of this RFI/SS (see Section 3.0 Operational Needs). While it is the intent of US-VISIT to fully comply with the statutory mandates to include biometrics as part of the Land Border Exit Solution, respondents are encouraged to describe incremental solutions that may start with captured biographical data and how the Land Border Exit Solution could evolve to accept biometrics in a set time period. If a respondent has specific recommendations on how biographic and biometric data capture should be done with a recommended technology or product, those recommendations should be made explicit in the response to this RFI/SS.
Respondents to this RFI/SS may submit material that addresses all or part of the biographic and biometric data capture needs for any or all of the travel modalities encountered at land ports of entry (POEs). A respondent should provide a clear statement of how each part of its submission addresses a specific need in this RFI/SS. If the described approach requires specific improvements to one or more land POEs, the respondent shall describe what is needed in sufficient detail to allow the Government to evaluate the practicality of the approach.
2.0	General and Background Information
The 9/11 Commission, Congress, and DHS agree that being able to accurately document the entry and exit of non-U.S. citizens is a priority for securing our Nation’s borders. The results of this market research will be used to inform planning for technologies, devices, processes, and/or procedures that can be used to biometrically verify that a specific in-scope traveler has exited from the United States via a land border. “In-scope” (see Section 4.1 In-Scope Travelers) is defined as the categories of visitors to the United States who are subject to the processes and procedures established by the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program. US-VISIT entry procedures use biographic information from valid travel documents and biometric data (currently fingerprints and digital photographs) to verify identity. 
US-VISIT provides biometric identification and analysis services to agencies throughout the U.S. immigration, border management, law enforcement, and intelligence communities. US-VISIT’s services help other agencies (stakeholders), such as Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in DHS; Department of Transportation (DOT); Department of Justice (DOJ); Department of State (DOS); and others to accurately identify people and assess risk. Those international visitors who experience US-VISIT biometric procedures—the collection of digital fingerprints and photographs—do so when they apply for visas at embassies or consulates abroad and when they enter the United States through air, sea, and land border POEs. In each case, a visitor’s fingerprints are checked against a database of known and suspected terrorists, criminals, and immigration violators. U.S. consular officers and CBP officers use the results from these checks to make visa issuance and admission decisions. On November 29, 2007, DHS began replacing 2-fingerprint scanners with new 10-fingerprint scanners at U.S. POEs to collect additional fingerprints from international visitors.
US-VISIT deploys identification and verification capabilities at air, sea, and land POEs that improve the integrity of the immigration and border management system while also mitigating the amount of time needed to process in-scope travelers. Functionality developed by US-VISIT has been implemented in phased rollouts called increments. Increments 1, 2, and 3 have provided the capability to obtain quick, secure, and biometrically verified identities in the air, sea, and land border environments. These capabilities are used to ensure that certain categories of aliens who travel to the United States are here legally, that the documents presented are legal documents within valid periods, and that the bearer of a valid travel document is the person to whom the document was issued. 
The biometric exit capability that is the subject of this RFI/SS might use the same information currently gathered by US-VISIT, but respondents to this RFI/SS are invited to suggest other approaches for establishing identity and verifying that identity with biometric data that is highly accurate and difficult to falsify. Because DHS already provides biometric (fingerprint) matching capabilities, and a great deal of DHS infrastructure has been deployed to acquire, transmit, match, and provide the results of fingerprint matching, the respondents to this RFI/SS should make use of these capabilities where they are relevant. However, DHS appreciates that other modalities may emerge in responses to this RFI/SS that also require a centralized matching capability (i.e., biometric matching on modalities other than fingerprints). In these cases, respondents should structure their responses to use existing capabilities, including additional capabilities for the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) managed by US-VISIT, and describe how and why the suggested approach would be an improvement over the fingerprint methods currently used. However, if the response does not require a centralized biometric matching capability, the respondent should describe how biometric verification of identity would occur in a manner that minimizes the opportunity for the fraudulent use of documents, credentials, devices, or other means to establish identity, and should also describe how and why the suggested approach would be an improvement over the fingerprint methods currently used.
The entry process at land POEs accommodates in-scope pedestrians; in-scope travelers in personal automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and similar conveyances; and in-scope travelers in commercial vehicles, including buses, trains, boats, ferries, and other surface transport conveyances. These modes of travel are referred to as land entry and exit modalities. In-scope travelers include people who intend to arrive or actually do arrive at U.S. ports for any purpose that involves applying for entry to the United States. If a non-U.S. citizen traveler is subject to US-VISIT procedures on entry into the United States, that traveler will likely also be subject to US-VISIT procedures to be established for exit from the United States.
For entry into the United States, US-VISIT in-scope travelers must carry and present appropriate travel documents (e.g., a valid passport and visa, if required) and possibly other documents (e.g., Arrival Departure Record, CBP Form I -94, for nonimmigrant visitors with a visa for the United States). Each US-VISIT in scope traveler is required to provide biometrics—digital fingerprints and a photograph—during the entry inspection process. Standards for fingerprints and photographs are available at www.biometrics.gov/standards. In contrast to the entry process, other than a pilot testing program (e.g., see 8 C.F.R. 215.8; no such formal biometric procedures have yet been required for in-scope travelers exiting the United States). 
This RFI/SS seeks ideas, approaches, processes, technologies, devices, and/or operational models for implementing an automated, biometrically verified exit capability that interfaces to and interoperates with other Government networks, services, and databases that are also used for US-VISIT entry procedures. Specifically, US-VISIT has provided the means to collect certain biographic and biometric information from in-scope travelers as they enter the United States to verify identity and to provide information used to decide the legal basis for entry into the United States. Biometric verification applies to non U.S. citizens—persons who exit the United States and who are within the applicable categories of in-scope travelers subject to US-VISIT requirements. Generally speaking, US-VISIT currently applies to all visitors (with limited exemptions) holding nonimmigrant visas and to visitors from Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries, regardless of country of origin. The biographic and biometric information collected is used by DHS to verify identity, to implement screening procedures, and to execute the responsibilities it has to operate a comprehensive immigration program.
As part of the systems and capabilities used to establish and to verify the identity of in scope travelers and to record entry and exit information, US-VISIT operates two systems: IDENT is a secure biometric matching system that uses fingerprints, and it may be extended in the future to use other biometric modalities to verify identity and to identify persons when a verification attempt cannot be confirmed. IDENT includes information collected by DHS as well as from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with records of deported felons and other criminals and DHS information on previous criminal histories and previous IDENT enrollments. A separate system, the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS), is used to securely store non U.S. citizen entry and exit data received from the entry and exit manifests of air and sea carriers and from land entries. Other systems also support or are connected to IDENT, including the FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the Computer Linked Application Information System (CLAIMS), the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), the Consolidated Consular Database (CCD), the Global Enrollment System (GES), the USCG Mona Pass proof of concept mobile biometric capability, and others. 
As a general rule, US-VISIT prefers open systems, standards-based data collection and data messaging formats, and commercially available and readily interoperable technology so that installation, operation, maintenance, and communications are based on accepted, widely deployed, and proven technology solutions. While products and technologies that do not attain all of these goals will be considered, US-VISIT requires that respondents to this RFI/SS clearly describe and detail any nonstandard, not-open, and/or proprietary aspects of their responses to this RFI/SS so that the Government can develop an accurate understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the responses.
The current exit procedure in effect at air, sea, and land ports is specific: all international in-scope travelers who received a Form I-94 upon arrival must return it to an airline or ship representative when departing the United States or deposit it into a designated receptacle if exiting the United States by means of one of the land travel modalities. DHS published a proposed rule establishing air and sea biometric exit requirements and plans to deploy an air and sea port biometric verification of identity solution for exit in 2009. This RFI/SS is to support a similar biometric verification of identity for in-scope travelers as they exit the United States at land POEs.
Legal entry to the United States occurs at specific POEs. Land POEs are defined as those that accommodate pedestrians; vehicles, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and other conveyances; or other facilities or processes that accommodate travel by train, boat, or ferry for entry into the United States. Each POE also accommodates exit from the United States In-scope travelers who enter the United States via one mode may exit via any other mode. The primary goal is to implement the mandated biometrically-verified land exit process with minimal impact on travel time and processing; cost and impact on traffic; surrounding environment and communities; and expense and inconvenience to the traveler. 
US-VISIT is seeking information to help implement the collection of biographic and biometric data from in-scope travelers as they exit from the U.S. by any of the land modalities noted in this RFI/SS. All such collection capabilities must interface to and interoperate with all existing DHS networks, infrastructure, and systems as necessary to maintain the integrity of DHS’s border and immigration management system. This RFI/SS requests that responses focus on the sensing/recording/input technology, devices, and/or operational and technical processes to be used at the land exit part of a POE only.
Because of the unique challenges of deploying a biometric exit identity verification solution in the land border environment, especially for multiple occupants of vehicles, land border biometric exit is being addressed separately from air and sea. Note that, for practical reasons, biometric identity verification is established by matching valid travel document(s) with biographic information and a biometric image or scan that agree with existing entries in DHS records. This RFI/SS requests that industry consider and provide suggestions to satisfy the functional needs and desired properties of biometric identity verification for land exit capability or technologies applicable to all land modes of travel. 
3.0 Operational Needs
The following presents a combination of characteristics that outlines the solution space for a land exit system and associated processes, components, and applicable technology. The land exit solution is envisioned to be a combination of processes and technology specifically adapted to the land exit environment, its in-scope travelers, and, as required, system operators. Land exit may encompass multiple technologies, each of which is superior in meeting a particular aspect of the land exit solution. This section presents operational needs as constraints, complexities, qualities, and processes that US-VISIT anticipates the land exit solution will need to address and possess, as well as to attain the following goals: 
•	Provide automated capture of an in-scope traveler’s biographic and biometric information safely and with limited traveler intrusiveness and throughput delays.   
•	Biometrically verify the identity manifested by biographic information on legal documents that are presented as part of the exit process.
The following describe the steps in a notional exit process that would be executed by existing DHS capabilities:
•	Transmit the biographic and biometric data collected at a port for an exiting in-scope traveler to DHS systems for biometric verification of the identity.
•	Perform biometric match operations.
•	Record an in-scope traveler’s departure from the United States in the existing ADIS system.
•	Match the exit record to the traveler’s entry record in the existing ADIS system.
Any or all of the above may be addressed by the response to this RFI/SS as appropriate to provide the solution suggested by the respondent’s work, or work in a way that improves the value to the Government and/or the traveler.
In all cases, the response should maintain or enhance the following overall US-VISIT goals:
•	Enhance the security of our citizens and visitors. 
•	Facilitate legitimate travel and trade. 
•	Ensure the integrity of our immigration system. 
•	Protect the privacy of our visitors. 
3.1 Constraints
Statute, DHS policy, or practical considerations impose the following constraints on, and preferences for, the land exit solution:
•	All data collection, usage, and storage related to land exit must comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, international treaties, and DHS guidance on privacy and security.
•	Land exit physical infrastructure improvements and construction must comply with applicable environmental statutes and regulations.
•	Biometric technologies must follow applicable biometric standards as documented at www.biometrics.gov/standards.
•	The Government prefers a land exit solution that applies to all existing land POEs on the northern and southern borders of the United States, but it will consider responses that describe potential solutions that are applicable to a subset of the land POEs.
•	Biographic and biometric data shall be collected at the time and place of exit from the United States or at a time and place that is, for practical purposes, virtually at the place of actual exit, such as a roadway or pedestrian facility leading to the actual border crossing point.
•	Respondents who propose a solution that would not be at the actual border crossing point (before exiting or after exiting) should describe in detail how this could be done securely.
4.0 Solution Complexities
Complexities are circumstances or facts that make the identification of a solution difficult and that drive the Government’s desire for an innovative solution. The following are key complexities.
4.1 In-Scope Travelers
In-scope travelers are:
•	Overall only a small percentage of travelers. Out of the approximately 350 million land border entrants to the United States annually, only about 3 percent are currently subject to US-VISIT procedures and data collection. Presumably, about the same number of travelers who enter via land ports will exit via land ports.
•	In-scope travelers are mixed with out-of-scope travelers.
•	A single vehicle may contain both in-scope and out-of-scope persons, and biometric exit procedures will apply only to the in-scope travelers.
In -scope travelers can cross at a land POE as:
•	Pedestrians. 
•	Operators of private vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and similar conveyances; or commercial vehicles, such as automobiles, buses, trucks, trains, ferries, boats, ambulances, bicycles, motorcycles, and similar conveyances
•	Passengers in either private or commercial conveyances.
In-scope travelers present multiple travel profiles:
•	Frequent travelers.
•	Infrequent travelers.
•	One time/infrequent travelers. 
•	Travelers who may enter at one port and leave from another, including air, sea, and land ports.
4.2 Facilities
There are 167 land POE facilities. Each land POE has some kind of exit infrastructure that may be as simple as a road, pedestrian path, or gate; or that may have improvements that provide inspection booths, other structures, road modifications, more elaborate gating structures, or other controls. The physical characteristics of POEs vary widely and may be no more than the roadway that crosses the border, a pedestrian path, or an improved facility that may or may not include specific arrangements to accommodate exit processing. These facilities present a variety of complexities:
•	Some POEs are extremely limited in regard to the extent of physical changes that could be introduced due to a variety of considerations, ranging from existing infrastructure that may or may not be owned or leased by the U.S. Government; historic and environmental considerations; weather and geographic constraints in land use; lack of utilities and/or communications; and similar considerations.     
•	POE designs vary from large-scale, complex facilities to simple, nearly rustic remote buildings.
•	POEs may be 24-hour/7-days-per-week operations while others may have limited operating hours and procedures.
•	POE operations and procedures are often driven by the physical layout of the POE. For example, some pedestrian exit areas have controlled turnstiles, while others have open and uncontrolled outdoor areas for pedestrian exit; some vehicle exit lanes are “at speed” and others lead into toll booth areas currently not used to conduct routine exit operations.
The facilities for exit capabilities are varied. Some POEs have infrastructures that make collecting biometrics at departure manageable, such as extended power communications; installed roads or structures; gate houses, turnstiles, and/or in-lane vehicle inspection booths; utilities; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC); high-speed data communications; space for sensitive equipment; and sheltered areas for inspections. 
Other POEs may not provide these kinds of infrastructure. Furthermore, border crossings may be adjacent to each other or only separated from each other by distances of a few feet. 
This RFI includes in-scope travelers who exit by ferry or rail crossings because they are categorized with land crossings, distinct from those exiting via cruise lines. 
4.3 Desired Qualities and Values
Respondents should identify potential technologies, devices, processes, and/or procedures that can provide all or parts of a biometrically verified data collection system for any or all of the 167 land POEs. The following qualities are desired:
•	Safe: The solution imposes no potential health risks to the traveler or inspector (if required in the context of the response), either through the use of the potential solution or an individual’s proximity to the devices associated with the potential solution, and does not interfere with the duties of any operator or inspections officer in a manner that poses a threat to the safety of the operator or officer.	
•	Secure: The solution prevents unauthorized duplication, alteration, or otherwise fraudulent use of devices or tokens that interfere with the intended use of the solution to biometrically verify the identity of in-scope travelers; the data associated with the solution is captured and transmitted in a manner by which it cannot be intercepted or used in a way other than as intended; and the data and use of the data is structured to protect the privacy of travelers.
•	Unobtrusive: The solution minimizes the actions (if any) by the traveler in the biometric collection process.	
•	Accurate: A minimum of 97 percent, with a goal of 100 percent, correct biometric identification and verification of legally exiting in-scope travelers, with no collection of data from out-of-scope persons.
•	Durable: The solution is built to withstand long periods of use, environmental exposure, both large and small volume use, and resistance to mechanical damage due to dropping, misuse, moisture, etc.
•	The solution is easily used by the traveler and operator, if an operator is required.
•	The solution is compatible with, or does not interfere with, the existing port environment to the maximum extent possible, including other technologies, such as those used for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), U.S. Canada Border Crossing Initiative (NEXUS), and Free and Secure Trade (FAST); and radiation portal monitors, license plate readers, and other screening devices.
•	Comprehensive: The solution applies with minimum adaptation to the population of in-scope travelers exiting the United States.
•	The solution has minimal impact on traffic flow.
•	The solution has minimal cost to the Government and to in-scope travelers, in terms of initial operating and maintenance costs, and in time or effort spent by in-scope travelers in the exit process.
•	The solution has low environmental and social impact (e.g., does not increase or render objectionable traffic patterns, impact historic sites, or compromise privacy) on in-scope travelers and surrounding communities. 
•	The solution provides a scalable solution/technology that can be used at both high-volume POEs as well as smaller, less well-developed, and less frequently used ports. However, this is not to be construed to discourage responses that provide a solution that is best for specific ports or situations.
•	The solution accommodates full-scope training and testing to ensure that personnel can operate the equipment/technology/process/procedure quickly, competently, and safely, and are able to obtain the intended results.
The Government prefers but does not require a solution that is as open, compatible, and interoperable with industry standard equipment and existing DHS biometric verification capabilities, including interfaces, protocols, and practices. The Government will evaluate responses in this light. It is generally understood that openness, compatibility, and interoperability mean that hardware and software easily attach to and work with commercial off-the-shelf products from other vendors without the need for custom hardware or software adaptation. Software drivers that are otherwise fully compatible with operating systems, computer hardware, and communications equipment in general use in DHS systems are considered “interoperable.” Respondents are requested to highlight not-open, incompatible, or noninteroperable aspects of their responses.
5.0 Specific Needs
The following information is provided to stimulate responses on how these needs might be satisfied. While many of these needs are stated in a “shall” format (suggestive of a mandatory requirement), for purposes of this RFI/SS respondents should respond with all appropriate or useful information, even if the information suggests an alternative requirement or standard or suggests reconsideration of the requirement described in this RFI/SS:
1.	Self identification by individuals to determine whether the traveler is in-scope may not be sufficiently reliable. Some assistance, indication, or screening step may be necessary to reliably and accurately apply US-VISIT processing to in-scope travelers.
2.	Processes, procedures, technology, or some combination of these that will enable two objectives:
A.	Rapid identification of in-scope travelers who are in-scope for US-VISIT processing.
B.	Rapid biometric verification of the identity of in-scope travelers, usually accomplished by evaluation of the validity of travel documents and the use of a biometric modality to verify the identity that is asserted by a document. For example, biometric identity verification is performed at entry by using an optical scanner to scan the machine readable zone (MRZ) of a valid travel document and by using fingerscans to determine whether the fingerprints of the person bearing the documents match the fingerprints of the identity on file in IDENT.
3.	The land exit potential solution shall be applicable to and effective with all current and anticipated categories of exiting in-scope travelers within US-VISIT scope.
4.	The land exit potential solution should be compatible across exit modalities. At a minimum, the potential solution should not interfere with devices, technologies, and processes in use for other modalities. 
5.	US-VISIT is committed to facilitating legitimate travel and trade. Accordingly, the time needed to obtain usable biographic and biometric data from a traveler shall be as short as possible while also ensuring that biometric verification of identity is at least 97 percent accurate, with a goal of 100 percent. Technical, process, or procedural add-ons must not cause excessive queuing or congestion at POEs.
6.	The technology described by the respondent for biometric verification of identity should not result in a false positive verification more than 0.1 percent of the time. 
7.	The biometric verification of identity should not result in a false negative verification more than 0.1 percent of the time. 
8.	Methods and mechanisms for reporting the results of identity verification both to individual ports and to DHS shall be defined in the context of the respondent’s solution.
5.1 Inputs and Outputs
These are the key inputs and outputs that the land exit solution needs to provide:
•	Input: Capture biographic and biometric data from in-scope travelers at exit from the United States, regardless of the land mode of travel and with as little interference with or delay of travel as possible.
•	Input: Accurate collection of biometric information from in-scope travelers as they exit through land POEs.
•	Output: Verification or failure to verify that the biographic and biometric data presented by travelers at POEs match with associated DHS records.
6.0 Response Guidelines
Respondents to this RFI/SS must provide information describing the suggested technologies, products, and biometric matching processes that are included in the solution. If the respondent’s solution is based on fingerprints, IDENT in its current form will provide the matching capability needed to verify identity. If some other biometric modality is part of the solution described, the relevant matching capability would presumably be added to IDENT. The respondent should describe how other biometrics for land border crossers would be collected at entry to facilitate the proposed solution for land exit. 
As noted elsewhere in this document, respondents should assume that the Government already has capabilities for storing data that associates biometric data with biographic data, network capabilities within the POEs and across DHS, and basic physical infrastructure (e.g., power, communications, and buildings). However, respondents should note any special needs or facilities necessary to accommodate their solutions, especially in the context of less well- developed ports and better developed ports where exit areas may be located adjacent to, but many yards from, the entry facility.
The narrative of the suggested solution should also outline how biometric characteristics will be used for comparison at exit to biometrically verify the identity of travelers. The narrative should also describe how the suggested technology will capture or interoperate with biographic information to be collected at exit.
6.1 Technologies and Products
Descriptive material shall be provided for each product or technology proposed by the respondent for the suggested solution, including devices for initial biometric capture as travelers enters the United States, the capture of biometric information as travelers exit through land POEs, the comparison of biometric exit data against stored data for identity verification, and any other equipment required to enable the suggested solution. The description should include:
•	Operational parameters, such as the distance from which biometric data can be captured, whether the biometric sample can be captured while the subject is moving, and environmental considerations, such as temperature, precipitation, dust, dirt, and illumination requirements.
•	Performance parameters, such as biometric read rates (how long data capture takes and how many in-scope travelers can be processed simultaneously), factors that impact performance (such as heat, humidity, or physical barriers between the reader and the traveler), and sources of capture or comparison errors.
•	Test reports or results that demonstrate how the performance parameters were calculated.
•	Equipment specifications, such as size, power, and communication and location requirements (e.g., outside and unprotected, office environment, and computer room controlled conditions).
•	Description of the maturity of the devices (e.g., whether these devices are currently in use in an operational environment, in testing, or in the conceptual or design stage).
•	Operations and maintenance requirements that would have an impact on large-scale deployments to the full range of ports described in this RFI/SS.
6.2 Biometric Matching Processes
US-VISIT currently uses fingerprints as the biometric modality for verifying traveler identity and so has extensive knowledge and existing capability in this area. IDENT, the system that provides the DHS biometric identity service, also is capable of extensions for matching on multiple biometric modalities. If the suggested solution includes the use of biometric data other than fingerprints, the respondent shall provide information to address the following:
•	Content of biometric data stored (e.g., image or mathematical representation of data).
•	Any biometric needed to be captured at entry to facilitate the exit process for those individuals exiting via a land border.
•	Approach for comparison of biometric data.
•	Uniqueness of biometrics captured (e.g., provide the probability that two individuals will have identical biometric data in a population of several hundred million, as will be contained eventually in IDENT for fingerprints).
•	Results for a comparison of biometric data (e.g., whether there is an absolute match/no match result or a list of potential matches is provided).
•	Approach to resolution if automated equipment cannot confirm whether there is a complete match between the data captured at exit and the stored biometric data for a single individual.
•	The algorithm used for the basis of comparison (e.g., whether the matching is based on a proprietary matching algorithm or published biometric standards)
•	Description of the maturity of the biometric matching process (e.g., whether the suggested matching process is currently in use in an operational environment, in testing, or in the design stage).
•	Compliance with relevant capture, data formatting, compression, communication, and other standards per the information available via the www.biometrics.gov/standards Web site.

<DESC>The Sources Sought notice is amended as follows:
1. This market survey is designed to seek out existing armor piercing capabilities.  It is not intended to promote new business or for suppliers to invest or develop new capabilities but rather evaluate existing products.  As such, a performance specification will not be supplied.
2. The government currently has M995 in inventory, therefore there will be no need for further procurement.  If any interested source has an existing product that is different that the current M995, the government will be interested in receiving information regarding that product as requested in the initial sources sought notice and amendment 0001 to the notice.
3. The governments intent is to issue purchase orders for armor piercing cartridges that are different from the existing M995.  If purchase orders are awarded the government will likely expect delivery of such ammunition within 60 days of award.
4. The performance specification would not specify a specific material design but rather would define a needed capability.
5. The sources sought notice closing date is being extended to 13 June 2008.

If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an <BR>interested party (those affected by the action) can request <BR>review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator <BR>(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to: <BR><BR>Wage and Hour Administrator <BR><BR>U.S. Department of Labor <BR>200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. <BR>Washington, DC 20210 <BR><BR>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the <BR>interested party's position and by any information (wage <BR>payment data, project description, area practice material, <BR>etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue. <BR><BR>3.)

Performance-Based Statement of Work for Avian Influenza/Pandemic Influenza (AI/PI) and Other Emerging Disease Surveillance:  The contractor shall provide support to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC)/Department of Defense (DoD) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DoD/GEIS).  The contractor shall support the AFHSC/DoD-GEIS Avian Influenza/Pandemic Influenza (AI/PI) and Other Emerging Disease Surveillance in six major areas, to include:  1) lease building to accommodate avian/pandemic influenza mission; 2) provide functional activity support to DoD/GEIS; 3) data analysis, interpretation, and reporting capabilities in support of AI/PI missions; 4) transportation of specimens to serum repository; 5) operations research cell at AFHSC for refined ESSENCE development; and 6) surge capacity and overseas support activities.  These tasks support the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza of November 2005 and the resulting implementation plans and support infrastructure.  The missions of the two major DoD organizations overseeing Avian Influenza/Pandemic Influenza (AI/PI) and Other Emerging Disease Surveillance are provided as follows:  AFHSC:  The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Centers main functions are to analyze, interpret, and disseminate information regarding the status, trends, and determinants of the health and fitness of U.S. military (and military-associated) populations and to identify and evaluate obstacles to medical readiness.  AFHSC is the central epidemiological resource for the U.S. Armed Forces providing regularly scheduled and customer-requested analyses and reports to policy makers, medical planners, and researchers.  It identifies and evaluates obstacles to medical readiness by linking various databases that communicate information relevant to service members experience that has the potential to affect their health.  (http://afhsc.army.mil/index.asp)  DoD-GEIS:  The mission of the DoD Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DoD-GEIS) is to conduct surveillance and response for emerging infectious diseases in DoD beneficiaries as well as foreign military and in foreign civilian populations through project-driven proposals which are implemented by its partner institutions and laboratories in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas.  DoD-GEIS focuses on diseases that threaten U.S. forces and their families, including newly appearing infectious agents or well-known agents that are increasing in incidence or geographic range.  (http://www.geis/fhp.osd.mil)  The GEIS strategic plan is based on the following four goals:  1) surveillance and detection; 2) response and readiness; 3) integration and innovation; and 4) cooperation and capacity building (including training).  The contractor shall provide on-site support specific to the requirements of the AFHSC/DoD-GEIS for the implementation support of the specified DoD Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Tasks outlined in the DoD Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan.  The contractor shall maintain the established infrastructure and capabilities necessary to enable detection and analyses of disease outbreaks and respond to inquiries from the medical/health authorities from the three military service medical departments, Federal medical agencies, and other DoD-associated activities).  The AFHSC and DoD-GEIS are expected to be able to analyze, interpret, and disseminate information received during the conduct of routine lab-based and record based surveillance activities as well as study project-specific epidemiologic data collection in support of outbreak investigations and/or other epidemiologic studies conducted among DoD beneficiary and civilian populations.  The contractor shall complete the majority of the tasks in the performance-based statement of work at 2900 Linden Lane, Silver Spring, MD  20910.  The contractor may be required to accomplish some tasks at other locations.  The Contracting Officers Representative (COR) will provide specific direction on a task-by-task basis.  All offerors must provide a written technical proposal discussing specified technical evaluation factors and cost proposal.  This is a competitive acquisition for the award of a cost plus fixed-fee contract consisting of a one-year base year and four (4) one-year option years.  Award will be made to the best overall proposal, which is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.  This will be accomplished using the best value approach of subjectively evaluating non-priced factors, analyzing price, and possibly selecting for award other than the lowest-priced offer utilizing the trade-off process.
