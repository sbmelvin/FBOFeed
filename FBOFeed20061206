<DESC>It is the intention of the Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Region to negotiate a sole source contract with Alan Mackachin for the purpose of converting the ten (10) River Operation Modeling System (ROMS) models from the current C++ programming language to Microsoft (MS) Office applications and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as the programming language.  The work will also consist of modifying the models to incorporate changes in the reservoir and river systems that have occurred over the last 15 years.  These will include changes to the reservoir and irrigation systems works and the need to address various environmental concerns.  All of the models need to be reviewed for future conversion from the present 16 bit processors to the more modern 32 bit processors.  Enhancements are also needed to provide a better interface with our Hydromet database and to provide improved graphics and data summary features.  The North American Industrial Classification Code is 541611.  The Standard Industrial Classification Code is 8742.  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC intends to purchase services on a sole source basis from the University of Toledo and the University of Akron as the only known available sources that can meet the Government's requirements.	The Universities of Toledo and Akron have extensive specialized expertise in the field of Computational Aero-Acoustics using high-order high-accuracy codes.  In particular, these Universities have been working with NASA for many years developing the Broadband Acoustic Stator Simulator (BASS) code which has been selected for this effort and they have extensive knowledge of the code internals.  The expertise necessary to implement the changes and additions (unsteady structured grid adaption) to the code in the timeframe of this one year effort does not exist elsewhere outside of NASA. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 15, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Astro-Med, Inc./Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI to provide two (2) COMET XL 35-Channel Digital PSG Record & Review Systems and related accessories for VAMC Iron Mountain, 325 H Street, Iron Mountain, MI 49801.  Astro-Med, Inc./Grass Technologies is the only manufacturer of COMET XL 35-Channel Digital PSG Record & Review Systems that offers virtually unlimited montages, off-line or in real-time, with the intuitive Montage Editor. The Montage Editor uses a graphical head-stamp interface for programming scalp montages, plus an Invasive Electrode montage creator which will automatically name the electrodes, create referential output montages, and create bipolar output montages by Row or Column. User-defined average-reference montages, channel types, and trace colors can also be defined. The Montages used for a given study are also stored with the EEG data for retrieval during review or in the future when reviewing archived data.  In addition, the physicians at the VAMC Madison, WI read VAMC Iron Mountains, MI NPSG’s (Sleep Studies).  In order for the VAMC Iron Mountain and VAMC Madison to share information, the equipment needs to be compatibility.  To the best of our knowledge, no other equipment is compatible except the COMET XL 35-Channel Digital PSG Record & Review Systems.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  Contract is firm fixed price and the NAICS Code is 334510.   This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and service, to the Contracting Officer within (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information must be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC GLAC, 5000 W. National Ave Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

APPROACH

The Government encourages responders to this BAA to submit executive summaries, and receive the Government's feedback thereto, prior to preparing and submitting proposal abstracts or full proposals.  The purpose of this is to spare responders the burden of preparing abstracts or full proposals that are unlikely to result in an award under this BAA.  The required formats for all three submittals (executive summary, proposal abstract, and full proposal) are provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  For all responses to this BAA, the responder must clearly identify the technical topic area(s) the proposed effort seeks to address.

Responders to this BAA may suggest the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Procurement Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or other such appropriate award instrument.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offer the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

PROPOSERS

The Government encourages responses from non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small or small disadvantaged business participation due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per P.L. 103-337 Section 217 and P.L 105-261 Section 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified Proposer is encouraged to respond.  
Responders may be foreign firms or may team with foreign firms as long as the firm meets the criteria in this BAA and the Government is otherwise permitted to conduct business with the firm, however, only unclassified proposals will be considered from foreign sources, or where any proposed teaming arrangement involves a foreign source.  Proposers may include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically, the proposed effort is unclassified, and such foreign personnel sign any and all appropriate non-disclosure agreements prior to participating in the research effort.
EVALUATION CRITERIA

The criteria to be used to evaluate and select offers under this BAA are, in order of descending importance: (a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit; (b) Offeror's Capabilities and/or Related Experience; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; (d) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition and (e) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit and relevance rather than against other proposals in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed. 

SUBMITTAL INFORMATION

This BAA will remain open from date of publication through 31 December 2008. DARPA will employ an electronic upload process for Executive Summary, Abstract and Proposal submissions for BAA 07-01.  All submissions will be submitted via http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa.

BACKGROUND:  The National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS), fulfills the legislative mandate of the National Science Foundation Act to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on scientific and engineering resources, and to provide a source of information for policy formulation by other agencies of the federal government. To carry out this mandate, SRS designs, supports, and directs periodic surveys as well as a variety of other data collections and research projects. These activities yield the materials for SRS staff to compile and analyze quantitative information about domestic and international resources devoted to science, engineering, and technology. To disseminate this information, SRS produces approximately 20?30 publications per year.  SRS requires editing and publication services to produce its reports. Examples of SRS publications are available online in PDF format at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/; printed copies may be ordered online at http://www.nsf.gov/publications/orderpub.jsp. Offerors are strongly encouraged to view several examples of SRS recent publications before submitting a response to this Request for Proposals.  SRS produces approximately 10?15 printed publications per year. These publications include short, data-release reports (InfoBriefs) and in-depth analytical reports (Special Reports).  SRS also produces approximately 10?15 electronic-only products per year, primarily Detailed Statistical Tables reports (DSTs).  The applicable NAICS code is 511120, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  The synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government or as a Request for Proposals.  Oral Communications and facsimile responses are not authorized.  All questions must be submitted electronically to the NSF, Attn: Garett Nelson, Contract Specialist, Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, at gnelson@nsf.gov .

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to make award, under simplified acquisition procedures, to five (5) recognized experts in the nuclear field, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  Each award will not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. DOE-ID is convening a team of nuclear experts with nationally recognized credentials and influence, to conduct a review of DOE-ID and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) safety basis implementation and events reporting, in the context of Departmental policies and practices, to achieve the goal of identifying cost effective measures for safe conduct of nuclear work, and potential changes in policy and practice.  These nuclear experts must have experience and name recognition within the most senior levels of government, academia, and industry, sufficient that their studied suggestions and opinions can influence nuclear safety policy and implementation within the Department. Additionally, the breath and depth of their experience must be sufficient to draw comparisons between DOE policy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission policy at the highest levels of policy development, as well as the implementation of respective policies by DOE contractors and nuclear utilities.  Substantial experience in nuclear policy-making activities, in either senior government, academia, or industry, is necessary.  Finally, due to the aggressive schedule to conduct the review in support of the national nuclear energy renaissance, these experts must be available to conduct the review during the first four months of 2007. The nuclear experts selected to provide the independent review of DOE-IDâ€™s and Idaho National Laboratoryâ€™s (INL) implementation of DOE safety basis and reporting requirements are:  Robert L. Long, ANS Past President, Nuclear Stewardship, LLC, as team lead; Bill Birchell,  Texas A&M University (Ret.); Bruce Matthews, DNFSB (Ret.); Roger Reynolds, AREVA; and Hubert J. Miller, PE, Nuclear Safety Consulting. Under award, these experts will team to evaluate current safety basis and reporting policies and regulations, and the implementation of those policies and regulations, from a cost-effective safety perspective, and recommend actions to improve the Departmentâ€™s balancing of safety and performance priorities.  The panel shall contrast DOE regulatory requirements with NRC requirements as appropriate.  The panel will assess the processes used by the INL Site and DOE headquarters for review and approval of documented safety analyses, technical safety requirements, Potential Inadequacy in Safety Analysis, Unreviewed Safety Questions, and associated reporting requirements. Visits will be scheduled to INL and DOE headquarters, if needed, by the full panel or smaller teams selected from the panel members. The teams would interview DOE site office and headquarters personnel and senior laboratory management, risk management staff, and facility operations personnel. After data gathering and analysis, a report will be prepared with recommendations for improving governance and safety implementation. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, however; any individual that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date of December 21, 2006.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award.  Responses are due by December 21, 2006, 11:00 a.m. (MT).  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is planned with Rand Machine Products, Inc. (Rand), 2072 Allen St, Ext., Falconer, NY 14733-0072.  Rand is the only source with a proven record of providing high-quality specimens with consistent characteristics, in a timely manner, that enable repeatable, consistent-quality test results.  For 5 years, the Damage Mechanisms Branch (AFRL/MNMW) has been developing a new steel for the fabrication of kinetic energy penetrators in conjunction with conducting penetration research that requires high quality, repeatable, reproducible machining of Research and Development test items.  During the development of this steel, general tests have been performed to characterize the material properties of this steel for various weapons program requirements.  To perform these tests, material coupons have to be fabricated from steel that will meet tight geometrical tolerances.  Additionally, the material coupons must have minimal or no surface defects in order to receive quality data that meets the program requirements.  Any variation in the surface finish, machining methods, or processing would invalidate data comparisons.  For the last 2 years, AFRL/MNMW has also conducted in-house research for Sand/Soil Stability of kinetic penetrators.  The penetrators fabricated for this effort must be of high quality, repeatable, reproducible machining in order to ensure performance measurement of the penetrators rather than potential machining defects/anomalies.  Rand has provided this research effort.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a maximum ceiling of $2.3M over a 5-year period with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.301-1.  NAICS code is 332999 with size standard of 500.  All responsible sources may identify their interest by submitting a capabilities package to the Contract Specialist noted below.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine or administrative questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Program Manager.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  Potential offerors are invited to contact the AFRL/MN Ombudsman, Colonel Jeffrey Schmidt (973)904-9700, with serious concerns only.  For technical information, contact Lt Zach Stolp, AFRL/MNMW Program Manager at (850)882-6836.  Business questions should be addressed to Shannon Paradise, Contract Specialist, at (850)883-2673.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>Description

This notice is intended to advertise a Federal Election Commission solicitation and consequent request for proposals from GSA Schedule 70 small business holders to provide support and operational activities for an electronic review system, a process that converts campaign finance manual filings to electronic format.  The contracted firm will provide support under a five year task order. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of best value with technical, past performance and costs factors considered.

(Scope of Project)

 Specifically, the Federal Election Commission (FEC or Commission) has been receiving campaign finance filings in electronic form since 1997. Congress has mandated that all committees that must file reports directly with the FEC and that reach certain activity thresholds must file electronically beginning with activity covering 2001.  Committees meeting these criteria have been filing electronically since that time.  The Commission has contracted to develop and operate an electronic filing system and to support other related information storage and retrieval requirements due to an increasing level of filings, with higher participation during election years. Additionally, systems have been established to provide online disclosure of enforcement activities for completed cases.  There is an incumbent currently providing these services.

(Proposal Procedures)

The RFP document can be obtained by email request received no later than December 11, 2006.           Instructions are contained in the RFP on submission of proposals. There will be a brief question and inquiry period before submission of proposals.  Questions are due by December 15, 2006. Responses to those questions will be provided by December 20, 2006.   Any firms on the GSA Schedule 70 interested in obtaining the RFP document should submit an email request to jconnell@fec.gov. Send emails to the attention of J.Connell and S. Butler, at jconnell@fec.gov and sbutler@fec.gov.  The RFP will be emailed to the requesting firms.  Proposals are due by January 12, 2007, 3:00p.m.  Offerors proposals should be mailed to:  Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20463, Attn:  Jacquelyn Connell, Contracting Officer.  

(Important Deadline Dates)

1.  Request for RFP  - December 11, 2006

2.  Submittal of Questions - December 15, 2006-Responses submitted by Dec 20, 2006 or prior to this date.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECT AGENCY (DARPA)  URBAN CHALLENGE SUPPORT

Description:

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office, intends to procure Logistics Support, Command and Control Support, and Operational Support required to support the DARPA sponsored Urban Challenge Program.  The Urban Challenge is the third Grand Challenge autonomous vehicle technology demonstration, a program  in which teams from the technical community will enter self navigating vehicles designed to negotiate a complex urban course without human drivers.  Successful offerors will provide the necessary support to ensure the success of a series of events that lead up to a timed race of unmanned, robotic vehicles over a high traffic, urban-environment obstacle course. This program was announced in May, 2006, and will culminate in November, 2007 with the Urban Challenge Final Event (UCFE).  As part of the Urban Challenge program, a series of qualifying events will be conducted leading to the National Qualification Event (NQE) in October, 2007 at a location to be announced (TBA) in the western U.S.  At the 10-day NQE, finalist teams are chosen to participate in the UCFE, scheduled to take place on November 3, 2007, also at a location to be announced in the western United States.  Both events are multi-faceted, complex, and involve the coordination of a large number of staff, spectators, members of the media, and participants.

DARPA intends to issue one or more time and material contracts to fulfill its requirement to provide support for both the NQE and UCFE.  The logistics contractor will interface with military and civilian personnel from the Department of Defense, other contractor teams, spectators, and on-site providers to provide event planning, training support, site support, staff support, registration, permits, lodging and catering, on-site infrastructure, security, command center, transportation, ceremony support and other related activities.  The command and control effort will provide services for an Urban Challenge course area with a diameter of several miles, and will require primary and backup tracking systems based on the Government-furnished E-stop and tracking systems.  Course-wide voice communications is also required.  Operational support will include course and site preparation, furnishing of vehicles and drivers, and other related activities.

Request for Proposal HR0011-07-R-0005 will be issued and posted to the FedBizOpps website at http://www1.fbo.gov and attached to the presolicitation notice on or shortly after the fifteenth day following the date of this presolicitation notice. This negotiated procurement will be issued on an unrestricted basis under full and open competition; all responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to receive a contract award from any DOD activity. CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website: www.ccr.gov. Also, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that all contractors use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission.  You may access ORCA via the following URL, www.orca.bpn.gov. Interested offerors may register at http://www1.fbo.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. DARPA will not directly send offerors the solicitation or any amendments. The offeror is  responsible for checking this web site periodically for updates and download the solicitation documents and attachments.

<DESC>Subject synopsis covers 19 7R Repairable items used in support of the V-22 Aircraft.  The only approved source is Boeing Helicopters Philadelphia (77272) located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.   The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.  Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in productio!  n of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.  This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required  by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability  to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Contracts and Control Review Department (CCRD) has a requirement for professional audit services in support of its Premium Compliance Program.  It is anticipated that PBGC may award one or more contracts on a labor-hour basis in support of this program.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811310   In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Risk Management Research Branch (NRMRL) in Cincinnati, OH seeks to award on a sole source basis to JEOL USA, Inc. of Peabody, MA for the purchase of preventive maintenance services for a JEOL Jem 1200 EX transmission electron microscope and a JSM 5800 LV scanning electron microscope. The period of performance shall be for one year from award date. NRMRL requires the preventive maintenance services for the two electron microscopes addressed above. The market research  conducted by the EPA determined that JEOL, USA Inc. is uniquely qualified to perform these services. JEOL is the manufacturer of the microscopes and the only source that has access to the engineering and electronic specifications to ensure accurate operations of the microscopes; no other company  has a similar level of information available to the service engineers.

This notice of intent is not a request  for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered must submit documentation which establishes that  their qualifications meet the  EPA's requirement to Yvonne Harris  (513) 487-2107 (fax) or  e-mail harris.yvonne@epa.gov  . Documentation must be received at the office identified above no later than 12:00 P.M. EST on  Wednesday December 21, 2006.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Evaluation of the Role of Poison Control Centers in a Drinking Water Contamination Warning System In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) in Cincinnati, OH seeks to  award on a sole source basis to Cincinnati Drug and Poison Information Center (DPIC) at the Cincinnati Children's Medical Center for the design and evaluation of the role of Poison Control Centers (PCC) in a drinking water contamination warning system and to design and evaluate the feasibility and  benefit of PCC inclusion in the ultimate WaterSentinel (WS) design. In response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed a conceptual drinking water contamination warning system, known as WaterSentinel (WS) that utilizes a  cache of monitoring strategies and surveillance tools to detect contamination. The initial WS pilot is located in Cincinnati, OH and the Cincinnati DPIC serves the Greater Cincinnati Water Works service area. Contracting with a Poison Control Center (PCC) other than Cincinnati DPIC would result in  testing the PCC component in isolation from the rest of the WS components, which would cause significant delay in full WS implementation. The Cincinnati Drug and Poison Information Center shall: (1) design and test a surveillance and detection system that analyzes (on a near real-time basis) calls  received by the 24-hour hotline for trends that indicate possible drinking water contamination and (2) develop and maintain a 24/7 hotline that provides toxicological expertise and consultation for water utility and public health officials investigating actual or potential exposure from possibly  contaminated drinking water.       This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A  determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 339111   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Cholestech Corporation, 3347 Investment Blvd, Hayward, CA  94545-3808 for the acquisition of an ENDO-PAT2000 diagnostic instrument. The ENDO-PAT2000 detects endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness using Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT).  It measures the magnitude and dynamics of arterial tone changes in peripheral arterial beds and records the arterial pulsatile volume changes.  It uses finger plethysmographic probes.   Analyses are automated by manufacturer's supplied software.  The ENDO-PAT2000 is FDA approved for coronary artery dysfunction risk assessment.  These crucial characteristics are not known to be available in any other single diagnostic instrument.  The EPA has identified Cholestech Corporation as  the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement.  In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy the circumstance permitting "Other than full and open competition" is FAR 13.106-1 (b) (1) only one source reasonably available.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other  source(s) exist; and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  The information received in response to this notice will  be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.   Submit response to:  the U.S. EPA, Attn:  Barbara L. Mattison (MC-E105-02),  Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711; by fax (919) 541-4273; or, by email at mattison.barbara@epa.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Haver Analytics, 60 East 42nd Street, New York, NY, 10165, for a subscription to the Haver DLX Database system. The purchase order will represent a renewal to the agency's existing subscription. Several features of the Haver DLX system make it unique. The proprietary software is designed to have the Haver DLX server transfers the data updates to a local network server. With all the databases available on a network server, the system allows unlimited simultaneous users to access identical data rather than individual users performing separate modem downloads at various points in time. The data provided by Haver Analytics is as reported from the data source. Haver is not in the forecasting and econometric modeling business and this type of service is not part of their databases. In addition, data can easily be retrieved into Microsoft Excel, exported into other file formats such as SAS, and graphics can be imported into both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. The Haver DXL system includes unlimited refreshes of data updates, monthly newsletters, software updates and access to the Haver website. The system includes a one-year subscription to the following databases: USECON; CBDB; REALTOR; USINT; G10+; FFUNDS; REGIONAL; LABORR; EMPLC; EMPLR; USPOP; PIQR, PICOUNTY; DLINQ; DLINQR; EUROPE; JAPAN; EMERGEMA; EMERGE; EMERGELA; ISFANN; IMFDOT; WBDEBT; INDUSTRY; HUD; MBAMTG; AND EXPORTSR. The period of performance for this requirement is January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued. All information received within 7 days after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC. Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Notice of intent to use Other Than Full and Open competition: The Government currently occupies 103,283 BOMA rentable square feet of space at 901 N. Stuart Street, Arlington, VA under Lease Numbers GS-11B-20789 and GS-11B-60779, which expired on July 15 and 16, 2006.  The tenant in this location is scheduled to move into federally owned space by no later than September 15, 2011.

If anyone has a location that they would like to have considered, please contact Julie K. Rayfield or Todd Valentine at 202.628.6000 by December 14, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Joint Vaccine Program (JVAP) requires an evaluation tool to discriminate between vaccine candidates that have proceeded through Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and identify criteria to compare vaccines for the same Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) licensure indication.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has an approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD) which defines performance parameters for developmental vaccines.  These performance parameters will shape the criteria and metrics used to asse ss the vaccine programs.  To ensure that industry best practices are utilized, the selection criteria used to govern decision planning must be relevant to the product, application, and the regulatory landscape to which they are being applied.  The selectio n criteria will be used to evaluate potential candidates, facilitate comparative analysis and, assess the ability of each program to meet the technical and business case analysis criteria.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for  this procurement is 541690 with a size standard of $6.5M in average annual receipts.  Proposals will be evaluated on a best value basis.  Solicitation No. W9113M-07-R-0001 will be issued ON OR ABOUT 11 December 2006 and proposals will be due ON OR ABOUT 2 0 December 2006.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued by this contracting office.

(9)  FA7000-07-T-0015
(10) December 8/December 15
(17).    The Department of Engineering Mechanics has a requirement for the procurement of a scanning vibrating probe system to monitor electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys to understand the corrosion kinetics in aging aircraft structures.  We currently do not have any system to monitor the corrosion potentials and corrosion current path in aluminum alloys.  This equipment will enhance our capability to monitor corrosion in high strength aluminum alloys.  Corrosion of aging aircraft is a widespread problem in the Air Force?s fleet.  This equipment will add a new dimension to cadet curriculum and USAFA?s research by demonstrating the creation of electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys in a liquid electrolyte. Quantification of the current and its path will help us determine the kinetics of the reaction.  This instrument will become an integral part of corrosion demonstration for cadets of EM350, EM445 and EM460 classes.  This will also enable us to develop scientific basis for establishing inspection intervals to monitor corrosion in aging aircrafts.  

We are interested in procuring Model SVP100 system consisting of model SVP370 probe, model ECW370 system controller, model 283 potentiostat/galvanostat, GPIB connector and software from Princeton Applied Research, because of the state of the art instrumentation and controls available in this system.  However any equivalent or better system meeting the following specs will help the Academy accomplish its mission:
 
The scanning vibrating probe equipment should consist of the general capabilities:
?	Be modular in design.
?	Be able to measure the electrochemical activity on specimen non intrusively.
?	Must be completely automated with connections to potentiostat/galvanostat and control computer.

Specific technical requirements are:
?	SVP unit with: 
o	Minimum scanning capability of 12? X 12? in X-Y direction with at least 1 inch travel in z direction.
o	Probe resolution of at least 1 micron.
o	Vibration amplitude of 50 microns or higher.
o	Scanning speed of at least 1mm/sec.
o	Minimum electrochemical sensitivity of 5 ??A/cm2.
o	Lock-in amplifier with amplification of up to 100,000.
o	Minimum SVGA resolution of 800 X 600.

?	Potentiostat/Galvanostat:
o	Fully computer controlled.
o	Minimum sensitivity of 1 pA and 2mV.
o	Scan range of at least 12V and 100 mA.
o	Built in IR compensation.
o	Computer system and related hardware to control the two systems simultaneously.
A  52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal acquisition will be conducted.  The NAICS for this acquisition is 334519 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Women owned and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit offers.   This acquisition is set aside 100% for small business enterprises.  The solicitation will be electronically available through this web site.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with TSA Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS) as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSTS07-07-R-00010, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This requirement will be an UNRESTRICTED acquisition.  The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  Services anticipated to begin on or about JANUARY 1, 2007.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training. NOTE:  THE RANGE MUST BE AN ESTABLSIHED RANGE; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO BUILD A RANGE. The range shall be within a 40 mile radius of the Denver Metro Area.  The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:

DHS will provide all AMMUNITION, TARGETS and FIREARMS INSTRUCTORS. The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated.  
The range must be able to accommodate 112 shooters, a minimum of eight days per month.  An outdoor range is preferred. Each shooter will fire approximately 500 rounds per qualification.

The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas.  The range shall be equipped with separate male and female indoor restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  It shall have parking available on site for a minimum of 35 shooters at one time.  A classroom to accommodate a minimum of 35 students should be available onsite along with a break room.  

The target system for the range should be a turning target system with steel poppers, track targets, falling steel plates, and fixed-faced targets.  A requirement to shoot both paper and metal targets is necessary.  Wood frames for the targets are also required at the range. A bullet trap shall exist on the range.   The facility should offer different levels of lighting, low light and no light.  A live shoot house should be available.  The range owner will be responsible for lead recovery at the range.

Two 10 ft X 12  ft storage units are required at the range site.  Special targets, aircraft seats, ammo and range equipments will be stored in this on-site unit.  

DHS personnel will use the range an average of 24 days per quarter (8 days X 12 months = 96 days per year/4 quarters) with an estimated 112 shooters per day; however, the Government shall have the right to increase/decrease this number without being subject to price changes.  The estimated number of rounds fired per year is 448,000 (based on 112 shooters X 500 rounds X 8 days). The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range in 8 hour blocks from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  This does not include weekends and Federal holidays. 

The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year options.  Offerors shall submit pricing for all range requirements.  Pricing must be quoted on a daily basis for aforementioned 24 days per quarter (  8 hours per day).  Pricing for the base year and 4 term option years must be submitted as follows:

NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart  12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-07-00028.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of  this full and open competition RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541620.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen:  Controlled Human Exposure Studies. II.  Period of Performance:  24 Months from date of Award III.  Type of  Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Labor Hours:  382 hours for Tasks 1-8 (78 hours for Optional Tasks 9-11) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this  process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information for criteria pollutants (viz., particulate matter, O3, Pb, NO2, SOx, and CO) in an Air  Quality Criteria Document (AQCD).   On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average, based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2 AQCD.  In 1982, EPA published another AQCD for nitrogen oxides (EPA, 1982), which updated  the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. The most recent review of the science on nitrogen oxides is included in the 1993 Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  The original NO2 standard remains in effect.  EPA is now in the process of again  reviewing the NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  The scientific information historically presented in the AQCD on NOx will summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and a Science Assessment (SA).  Attachment 1 briefly presents the multi-disciplinary issues that are individually  discussed in the SASD and then integrated in the SA.  The first draft of the SASD will reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce an external peer review draft that will be reviewed at a public meeting. Peer review comments will be  incorporated in the draft final SASD.  From this, the SA (a concise integrative document) will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) and for public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two  drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document.   The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established according to a court-ordered schedule.

The following information is provided to assist VA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort. VA is conducting this market research to determine the market presence of Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) capable of providing the equipment and services VA requires, and whether adequate competition exists to set this requirement aside for SDBOSBs.  VA is contemplating a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to lease and/or buy roughly 250,000 PCs and monitors over the course of the next three (3) years.  If VA chooses to lease the equipment, the lease term for the PCs (when ordered), will be three (3) years, with the option to extend the lease for two years, or to purchase after the lease is completed.  The contract period shall consist of a three year period from date of award, and two one-year option periods for renewal at the discretion of the Government.  During these two additional option years, no new equipment will be ordered by VA (those two years will consist of maintenance/replacement of existing leased equipment only). The contractor shall be required to provide a sample configuration of the PC to VA once each order is issued against the IDIQ, with shipment to various VA facilities following approval of the configuration (it is anticipated there will be 2 main configurations and roughly 35 different images necessary to satisfy VA requirements).  In addition to providing the PCs and monitors, the contractor shall install the new equipment, and sanitize and dispose of the old equipment as directed by VA.  The equipment shall be installed at all VA sites within the continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  The contractor shall also provide the equipment (to be sold to VA, not leased), and maintenance for an asset management system to track all leased equipment plus additional VA-owned/leased equipment.   This is a sources sought announcement only; no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to respondents.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  The Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. A Government proposal to provide these services may be developed and a contract may or may not result. This notice is to determine interest and capability of potential SDVOSB sources for this requirement.  Responses will not be returned.  Interested SDVOSBs should respond, via email, to the Contracting Specialist, Jeff Bishop, at jeff.bishop@va.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses should include the following information: Verification that the contractor is an SDVOSB, and a capabilities statement, limited to 8 pages, to include the contractors ability to provide, install, and maintain PCs, to include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied to install and maintain the leased equipment.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to seek potential vendors that could fulfill the below requirement.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the NIH to identify capable potential businesses for budget consulting services for National Institutes of Health as described below.  Below is a Draft Statement of Work: 

Draft Statement of Work

The NIH Office of Budget (OB) requires a single onsite contractor employee with expertise in budget skills to assist in developing, coordinating, monitoring and communicating the annual budget operating plan for the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical Research.  Administering the budget for the Roadmap is especially complex because it involves interactions with all 26 NIH Institutes and Centers. 

Given these challenges, the OB requires assistance to manage this high-priority program that is in its fourth year of implementation.  In FY 2007, as a new type of trans-NIH resource, extremely careful attention must be paid to insuring the research projects are properly classified and tracked.  This level of detail requires an in-depth knowledge of the overall Roadmap research portfolio and the anticipated budgetary expansion and constriction of the initiatives over time.  In addition to familiarity with the overall Roadmap functions and program, multiple ongoing tasks such as executing multiple interagency agreements for Roadmap administrative support in the ICs; performing and monitoring Roadmap funding data integrity tests throughout the year; conducting Roadmap Disease Coding exercises; giving required notices to Congressional Appropriations Committees and evaluating Roadmap FTE allocations must be performed.  In addition, beginning in FY 2007 Roadmap budget activities gain additional layers of complexity following the establishment of the new Office Portfolio Analysis and Strategic Initiatives (OPASI), adoption of an institutionalized ?Common Fund? model and the onset of a hybrid (and very high profile) program---the Clinical and Translational Science Awards in which partial funding of the program comes from the Roadmap and partial funding (plus all administrative oversight) is contributed by NCRR.  These two new activities will require the review and, in some cases modification, of existing Roadmap policies and a procedures that will, in turn, require adjustments in budgetary and tracking procedures and practices as well.  In sum, current and anticipated activities within the Roadmap program require the consistent, responsive budgetary oversight by a professional familiar with the rules and regulations governing the NIH and, in particular, the Roadmap research program.

Work will take place on NIH Main Campus located within Bethesda, MD.  The contractor employee shall work no more than 1664 hours a year, which is approximately 32 hours per week.  The contractor employee shall been given a government furnished workstation which would include a computer, a telephone, and other office related equipment to be used only for work related to the requirement.

Contractor Tasks

Develop methodologies to allow OB to track Roadmap (RM) funds by project, by IC, and source of funds (IC/DDF), including:

1.	Maintain RM paylist for noncompeting and competing awards
2.	Allocate and track RM budget by source of funds
3.	Report quarterly on RM obligations
4.	Prepare quarterly notice to Appropriations Committees 
5.	Draft RM policy with budget implications and instructions to ICs re those policies
6.	Work with lead ICs for RM activities
7.	Answer questions on RM from IC budget offices
8.	Coordinate activities with Roadmap-assigned Budget Officers
9.	Work with a junior budget analyst to develop her expertise in administering the Roadmap budget.

Responses must reference the sources sought to Sources Sought Number 263-2007-M(GO)-0058 and include the following: (1) Name and Address of the Organization, (2) The size standard (large or small business) and small business program, if a small business, (8a, Service Disabled Veteran, HubZone, etc) status of the company as seen at listed under www.ccr.gov, (3) Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and email, (4) DUNS number, (5) Resume of Budget Consultant that should showcase 
-	In depth knowledge of Roadmap/trans NIH funding policies, procedures, and practices 
-	Expert analytical and communication (written and verbal) skills 
-	Expertise w/excel spreadsheets
-	Expertise in grants analysis
-	Familiarity with grants databases (QVR)  and financial  data bases (such as the Strategic Initiatives Database or SID)
-	Ability to exercise judgment and work independently to prepare recommendations for OB/OPASI
-	Ability to work closely with and be responsive to with senior management

(6) List of three references to whom similar types of services have been previously provided to include contract number, dollar value, name and phone number of customer The references must be relevant to the requirement and be within the last three years of December 1, 2006.  The references must also include a description of the services rendered under that contract.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet and to solicit information from Industry. This document is for information and planning purposes only, and is intended to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of requirement, as well as to promote competition decisions.   This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action on this matter.  Further, neither NASA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. NASA invites you to submit a response to this RFI, to assist in developing evaluation criteria, tools, and process modeling, optimization and integration techniques to identify and compare alternative system designs, operations processes, and process implementations that result in low cost operations and sustaining engineering of developed capabilities for the Constellation Program.   NASA recognizes that a high priority must be given to system designs and integrated processes that enhance, simplify, and streamline the operations of the Program. To this end, emphasis will be placed on integrating, refining and redefining end-to-end processes, from manufacturing/integration/test through pre-launch processing, launch operations, mission operations, recovery and refurbishment, and finally disposal of human-rated space vehicles.  NASA will be developing tools, models and simulations to evaluate integrated processes and analyze them for potential efficiencies and savings.  Of particular importance will be the ability to identify and quantify those underlying processes and aspects of the system design that contribute disproportionately to the overall life cycle cost. The results of these modeling and analysis activities may drive changes in the system(s) design, the processes, and/or the process flow designs to realize maximum life cycle benefits for the Government.  Any such changes will need practical strategies for implementing new requirements within the existing contracts. The ‘life cycle process flow’ needs to be designed, modeled, analyzed, reviewed and improved just as systematically as the flight hardware and software design. The ‘life cycle process flow’ should be addressed as an integrated set, such that essential trades between the designs of flight hardware and software, and the designs of the end-to-end operations processes lead to the lowest life cycle cost solution for the overall Program, rather than a process that is optimized for only one Project or phase of the Program.  This iterative assessment/refinement cycle must begin early in the Program life cycle allowing the opportunity to make changes that could provide substantial benefits to the Program before the design and development cycle matures to a point where it is no longer cost effective to implement changes. NASA recognizes the advances of industry in achieving synergistic process and product designs that minimize life cycle cost.	Today’s techniques for modeling and optimizing processes, using discrete event simulation, state-of-practice process engineering, data modeling, and other techniques/tools to establish an early, virtually-distributed multi-systems integration capability among implementing projects provide a tremendous advantage and opportunity over prior generations in addressing this important area. The specific objective of this RFI is to request information on the full scope of activities, tools, models, and evaluation criteria used to optimize integrated processes in order to improve the long-term operability and life-cycle affordability of the overall Constellation Program.	Responses are requested to any or all of the following topics: 1.	Based on industry experience, which program/project milestones are best associated with the planning of which parts to manufacturing, test, integration, operation and sustainment (engineering and logistics)?	What should the maturity level be for the manufacturing, test, integration, operation and sustainment plans, requirements and designs at each of the program/project milestones? 2.	What is the present state-of-the-art in process modeling and simulation (M&S), as well as the associated tools that can, or should, be applied to this task? 3.	What are the key observable/measurable characteristics of an operations-optimized program consisting of multiple interacting systems, and how are these characteristics best captured in models and assessment tools, requirements, and figures-of-merit? 4.	What are the key considerations in determining the condition, location, and timing of handover from one organization to another for continued processing or for higher indentured integration? 5.	How are the perceptiveness and effectiveness of tests in different configurations, environments, and levels of indenture used to influence optimization of manufacturing and integration flow? 6.	To what degree is data architecture (the collection and control of information related to the product line build records, acceptance, testing, integration, quality assurance, verification, problem reporting, flight history, mission-specific attributes and conditions, etc.) key to minimizing lifecycle cost? Are there preferred best practices or approaches to data architecture that can best assure a successful outcome? 7.	Who uses what data in operations-optimized recurring launch and flight operations?  Relate data architecture approaches (see 6 above) to these user needs. 8.	Ways to promote and encourage development of productive relationships among the Constellation Program Prime Contractors are requested. (Orion – Lockheed Martin; CLV 1st Stage – ATK Thiokol; CLV Upper Stage Engine – Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne; Upper Stage – NASA as design agent and a to-be-determined production contractor) NASA is requesting information that responds to any or all of the above topics. Additionally, responses must include the following:  name and address of firm; size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; and whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, veteran owned, and/or service disabled veteran owned. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  NASA will likely provide Proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party Proprietary information in confidence.	By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors.   All responses received will be evaluated and considered for inclusion in a resultant action should an action be warranted by NASA.  However, NASA makes no commitment to include any particular recommendation into such an action. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is Industry’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Final responses to this RFI are due by Friday, January 26, 2007, to Ms. Tiffany Meadows by one of the following methods: Email:	tiffany.meadows-1@nasa.gov (preferred method)  Fax:	281-483-0503 Mail:	NASA Johnson Space Center 	Attn: BT/Tiffany Meadows 	2101 NASA Parkway 	Houston, TX 77058. Additionally, advance notification of intent to submit a response to this RFI is requested via email to Ms. Meadows by Tuesday, January 16, 2007. All questions regarding technical content of this RFI should be forwarded via email to Ms. Susan Mauzy at susan.e.mauzy@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns or for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB) or for Small Businesses.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of identifying and determining the availability of sources capable of performing design/build (DB) construction services. These services are required for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pascagoula Laboratory Project in Pascagoula, MS.  

Project Scope: The proposed project is new construction of approximately 51,000 gross square feet to house laboratory, support services, and administrative functions of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Mississippi Laboratories and National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL). The building footprint limitation will probably require a two-story structure plus an equipment penthouse to provide the necessary space. This structure will be used for cutting edge marine science and technology research and should be designed to facilitate and reflect those activities. Proactive and preventive hurricane survivability measures are mandatory for this structure. Additionally, it must meet a minimum sustainability requirement of Silver on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification scale of the U.S. Green Building Council. The work will consist of design and construction of the new facility and associated parking on the proposed construction site based on a schematic level description of requirements. The maximum available funding for all design and construction effort is $22.0 million. Occupancy is planned for mid-2009.

Basis for Evaluation: Responses to this announcement will be used to determine whether there are enough qualified DB small business sources to permit a small business set-aside (SBSA) acquisition or whether a full and open competition will need to be conducted for this action. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria presented in descending order of importance:

1. Documented recent experience in DB construction of laboratories, full-service hospitals, or similar facilities to include associated complex heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
2. Documented experience in performing and successfully completing comparable projects in the post-Hurricane Katrina/Hurricane Rita stricken areas of the Gulf Coast states.
3. Proven established subcontracting relationships in the Gulf Coast states region on comparable recent projects.
4. Proven ability to successfully complete comparable recent projects at the required quality level, on schedule, and within budget.
5. Documented LEED experience on comparable projects.

Submission of Responses: Sources can be a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity having full contractual responsibility for the project. To be responsive to this sources sought notice, interested parties must submit the following documentation:

1. Evidence of successful experience on DB projects of similar type and scope during the past ten years. Evidence must include contract numbers, project titles, total project dollar values, and points of contact with current contact information to include telephone and facsimile numbers and e-mail addresses. More importance will be assigned to more recent experience. 
2. Evidence of experience in performing and successfully completing comparable projects in the post-Hurricane Katrina/Hurricane Rita stricken areas of the Gulf Coast states.
3. Evidence of established subcontracting relationships in the Gulf Coast states region on comparable recent projects.
4. Evidence of ability to successfully complete comparable recent projects at the required quality level, on schedule, and within budget.
5. Documented LEED experience on comparable projects.
6. Evidence of current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) documenting size status and other socioeconomic qualifications.
7. A positive statement of intention to submit an offer as a prime contractor under any resulting solicitation.
8. Evidence of bonding capacity at the maximum anticipated value of this project.

Submissions provided in response to this notice will not be returned. All submissions received will be evaluated by qualified NOAA professionals. A determination by the Government to restrict competition for this project based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This is not a request for proposals. Nor is it an offer to contract or a Phase One solicitation for qualification statements. This announcement does not create any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this notice nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this notice. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received. It is anticipated that a single best value negotiated solicitation for the entire DB process will be issued for this project. It is expected that it will result in a firm fixed-price contract award.

Submissions in response to this notice must be received not later than Monday, January 8, 2006, at 3:00 p.m. CST.

<CONTACT>GAYLE NORMAN, (256) 876-4900
<DESC>Request for Information  For non-developmental Electronic Support Measures (ESM) Systems to Support Army Air Defense Systems. Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sought.  Contract POC: Ms. Gayle Norman, US Army Aviation and Missile Command, AMSAM-AC-RD-RB, Redstone Arsenal, AL. This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).   The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does th e Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  AMRDEC is interested in receiving information on ESM systems already developed or in devel opment that could be utilized as adjunct sensors within Army air defense systems and that will be available for demonstration testing within the next ten (10) months.  The objective of this process is to assess current and working prototype products within  the US Electronic Warfare (EW) industrial base, particularly as they relate to a notional ESM system specification that has been developed by the AMRDEC.  Within an Army air defense system, the ESM system would be used for detecting, locating, and identif ying airborne targets based on their radio frequency (RF) emissions.  The airborne target set consists of cruise missiles (CM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and fixed wing (FW) and rotary wing (RW) aircraft.  The location and identification information provided by the ESM system will be fused with other sensor data as a part of a Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP).  In this application, precision angle of arrival measurements at low signal to noise ratios are vital.  Consequently, systems that are desi gned to function primarily against the main beam of the target emitters are not the focus of this RFI.  The interest lies in complete systems with a target price of $500,000.00 but not more than $750,000.00 under a production scenario acquiring 100 to 200 units.  Complete information on the ESM system requirements can be found in the AMRDEC specification which is classified at the SECRET/NOFORN level and can be obtained as noted below.   ****As a condition of responding to this RFI, it is a requirement that a potential responder possess the means to properly store and work on information classified at the SECRET/NOFORN level.  Only US based and owned companies are eligible to respond.  Int erested responders must request the AMRDEC ESM System Specification in writing or via e-mail; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to US Army, AMCOM, AMSAM-AC-RD-RB, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000, ATTN: Ms. Gayle Norman or the following e-mail address: gayle.norman@us.army.mil.  Requests must include: company name, Company And Government Entity (CAGE) Code, classified mailing address, and appropriate point of contact information.  All requests must be received within 12 calendar days of the date of this notice.  After validation by the AMRDEC Security Office of each interested responders security accreditation and eligibility to receive the AMRDEC ESM System Specification, a complete copy along with  the appropriate security classification guide (SCG) will be mailed to each validated responder. Responses to this RFI should only include candidate systems that have been successfully demonstrated in a similar application or those that are in a lab-prototype stage.  The response should include a white paper of no more than 10 pages or a Power Point p resentation of no more than 20 charts describing the system, how it compares to the AMRDEC specification, performance results-to-date, and where applicable, points of contact for Government sponsors.  Responders are encouraged to provide explanations for t hose areas in which their product a ttributes differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the AMRDEC specification, as well as to provide commentary on the reasonableness of the AMRDEC specification.  Based on the responses, the AMRDEC, solely at its discretion, may request u nfunded, follow on, face-to-face briefings.  RFI responses are to be received within 21 calendar days of the mailing date of the classified AMRDEC specification.  All information must be in writing or via e-mail; telephone requests for additional informati on will not be honored. ****You may forward unclassified responses to US Army, AMCOM, AMSRD-AMR-SG-RF, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000, ATTN: Mr. Will Caraway or the following e-mail address: will.caraway@us.army.mil. ****Classified information will be ac cepted by mail only; please mark it accordingly, and send it via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army, AMCOM, AMSRD-AMR-SG-RF, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000.  The inner wrapping shall be addressed to: ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-SG-RF (Mr . Will Caraway).  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, please mark it accordingly.  Appropriate proprietary claims will be honored and protected to prevent improper disclosure.

<DESC>This announcement is notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The items to be purchased as a sole source are to reprogram an existing US Army Corps of Engineers Reservoir Program. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511, business size standard is 23 Million.     The sole source contractor is Resources Management Associates (RMA) (CAGE 4J607). Resource Management Associates (RMA) has been employed by HEC to develop numerous hydrologic engineering applications, including, CWMS.  The RCC uses these applications and m aintains a CWMS system on-site and at the COOP center located at the Lewisville project office.  These applications, as well as the applications being replaced under this contract, all rely heavily on a set of JAVA, FORTRAN, C and C++ libraries developed b y HEC for use in the development of hydrologic engineering applications.  RMA has extensive experience in the development of applications using these libraries.  It would require significant additional time and funds for another contractor to become profic ient in the use of these libraries.  Additionally, RMA has been employed by HEC as a contractor in the development of CWMS and would be best able to ensure compatibility and integration of the RCC replacement applications to CWMS.  It is therefore in the b est interest of the Government to sole source this contract to RMA.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to Resource Management Associates for the following The Fort Worth District, US Army Corps of Engineers, Reservoir Control Sect ion (RCS) is requesting programming services to develop a Windows XP based program to replace several existing water control computer programs.  The new program will have a graphical user interface (GUI) and will be written in Java.  The water control comp uter programs that are to be replaced let the user retrieve, display, edit, and perform calculations on the data stored in the Reservoir Control Sections databases.  The databases consist of both time series and static data for reservoirs, stream gages, a nd weather reporting stations that are regulated, monitored, maintained, or used by the Fort Worth District. The new program will retain the functionality of the existing programs and will also have enhancements.  Most of the existing programs are written in UNIX FORTRAN and C, and run in an XTERM window.  Two of the programs are written in Java and run in the XP environment.  The new program will operate in the Windows XP environment. The databases reside on both UNIX and Windows 2003 servers.  The new pro gram will access the UNIX data base through the Samba interface.  Any contractors who believe that they have the capability to meet the listed qualifications may submit, for consideration by the government, a statement of capability. Comments are due by 15 December 2006, at Noon, however the posting will remain for a per iod of not less than ten days.  If no comments are received by the closing date, a purchase order will be issued to the above named sole source.

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of Title 10, U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<SUBJECT>99--Wide Area WorkFlow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA)
<DESC>Dear Valued Contractor:  U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) is excited to announce that we are able to offer you the opportunity to join us in the deployment of Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA). WAWF-RA is designed to automate Commercial Invoices and Government Receiving Reports in a web based, paperless environment. WAWF-RA electronically captures and coordinates the four basic pieces of the payment process. WAWA-RA users input invoices and receiving reports via the Internet and are compared to contracts stored in the Defense Finance Accounting System (DFAS) - Electronic Document Access (EDA) system. Once the invoice and receiving reports are approved and processed, payment transactions are initiated via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to the contractor's bank account.   Some AMC activities have already started, but as of 30 November 2006, the rest of AMC will use WAWF as an option for receipt and acceptance of goods and services procured by contracts that contain DFARS clause 252.246.7000.  As we implement the government side of this system, we are strongly encouraging you to begin using the WAWF as well.  This will lead to the eventual elimination of the paper flow of documents associated with the receipt and acceptance business practice.  For further guidance and instructions contact either the Contracting Officer or if assigned the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) that services your contract with AMC.  A complete listing of AMC Contracting Offices is available at http://www2.fbo.gov/spg/USA/USAMC/index.html.  In addition Training is available on-line at http://wawftraining.com/.  The Point of Contact for this action is Mr. Richard A. Smith, 703.806.8133.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
This solicitation, number DTFR53-07-R-00003, is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). 
This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)  2005-13.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Safety, Safety Improvement and Development Team (SIDT) intends to award a contract to an educational organization interested in providing Continuing Educational Units (CEUs) to FRA employees who attend training developed, delivered, and/or managed by the SIDT.  For the past two years, the SIDT delivered most technical training on the campus of Johnson County Community College (Kansas), and contracted with this educational institution for review of the course development, validation of learning objectives and pre/post testing, and providing CEUs for attendance at SIDT training.

The SIDT is responsible for providing technical training to all Federal and participating State safety inspectors and specialists nationwide, and attendance is mandatory for this target audience.  SIDT does not provide training to external organizations because of resource constraints, and because these courses are designed and developed for a specific regulatory audience.  The SIDT uses the SAT (Systematic Approach to Training) model to develop courses delivered to Office of Safety employees, and has customized application by developing a series of tools to perform up to three levels of validation for instructional objectives and pre/post testing.   

The FRA will deliver training in several cities throughout the Continental United States beginning in FY 2007 and future Fiscal Years, with delivery beginning in November 2006.  FRA will use hotel meeting rooms for training delivery, and training classes will begin either on a Monday or Tuesday of each week that training is offered.  

SIDT schedules about 60 training classes each Fiscal Year, and usually schedules 20 FRA employees for attendance at each class.  Course hours range between 20 and 30.  FRA will be delivering up to four training classes during any particular week, and this training may be delivered at more than one location in the same week.  FRA prepares both a training course catalog and class/course calendar by the middle of October of each year.  The catalog lists the course ID and name, number of hours, and course description with terminal level objectives.  FRA will provide both of these documents to the educational institution with whom we sign a contract, and will provide updated calendars if revisions are necessary during the training year.

The period of performance will be one base year plus four one-year option periods for a total of five years, if all options are exercised. The anticipate award is early December 2006.

The FRA will award one contract based on the best value to the Government, which will include price, past performance and the offerors? technical approach, including administrative requirements imposed on the FRA SIDT staff during contract implementation and management.  

Educational organizations interested in contracting with FRA should be aware of the following:  

1.	Each FRA training specialist develops enabling objectives for each course, and uses an in-house form to validate the level of learning for each of the cognitive and affective domain objectives.  The SIDT coordinator performs a second-level review of the objectives to ensure the instructional methods are suited to the level of learning the training wants to reach.  FRA also uses an in-house method for performing trainer and team coordinator validations of pre/post test questions if the training uses testing for a particular course.  

2.	The successful educational organization would also perform a validation of the course materials, objectives, and tests.  FRA will provide the data to the institution in either hard-copy or electronic format for review and filing.  FRA will provide these materials once for each course, regardless of the number of classes scheduled for any particular course.  If a course is modified, FRA would provide the updated course materials again.  

3.	The SIDT will offer about 1,100 student weeks of training in Federal  Fiscal Year 2007, and anticipates a similar number of student weeks in future fiscal years.  Based on analysis of CEU requests for Fiscal Year 2006, FRA estimates about 55 percent of students will request CEUs.  

4.	The FRA anticipates developing five new courses per year and revising five courses per year.

The list below indicates the administrative and logistical steps in the process.  The educational organization shall be responsible for compliance with these steps. 

1	SIDT training specialists will use an in-house form to validate attendance, and can either fax or e-mail the form from the contract hotel training site to the educational institution?s point of contact.  The educational institution must prepare the CEU certificates upon receipt of the faxed or e-mailed attendance form, and must send them to the SIDT training specialists via overnight package.  FRA prefers delivery on the Wednesday of each class, but must have delivery to the contract hotel no later than 9 a.m. on Thursday morning of each training class.  

2	The educational institution will provide FRA with an electronic version of the form which students must complete if they are interested in obtaining CEUs.  The SIDT training specialist will distribute the forms for completion during the first morning of the class, and will send those forms at FRA expense to the educational institution point of contact via overnight package delivery.  The SIDT training specialist will also enclose the original signed attendance listing in this package.  Currently, the U.S. Government uses Federal Express for this service.  

3.	If circumstances beyond the control of either FRA or the educational institution prevent delivery of the CEU certificates before the class ends and the students are released to travel home, the educational institution will be responsible for mailing the certificates directly to the students.  FRA presumes the forms provided by the educational institution will include each student?s mailing address, and would expect the educational institution to perform this service and to advise the FRA Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) that they have done so via e-mail.

4.	The educational institution must prepare an invoice identifying each FRA employee to whom CEUs were issued, and submit this invoice to the FRA COTR for review and approval.  This invoice must be prepared no later than five days from the end of the month during which FRA delivered the last day of training for a particular class.

5.	The educational organization must provide a transcript of educational credits directly to the FRA students upon demand, but at least once each calendar year, and will advise the FRA COTR via e-mail when transcripts are sent to the students on a global basis.

6.	The educational organization must provide the FRA COTR with the name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address for both a primary and a secondary (back-up) point of contact.

Proposal Evaluation:
Technical proposals will be evaluated based on the offeror?s ability to meet the FRA?s requirements as specified above. Educational organizations submitting proposals must specify how they intend to meet of the performance for which they would be accountable.  Offerors shall provide at least two examples of past performance for efforts similar to this requirement, including a brief description of the work performed and point-of-contact information (name, address, phone and e-mail, and contract number if applicable).  

Cost proposals must specify the number of CEUs offered per 10-hour block of instruction, the cost to FRA for each student CEU, the costs for course evaluating, and any administrative costs.  The proposal may total costs into one category, i.e. - costs per CEU include the total costs, or may separate the costs into two or more categories.  If the costs are separated into categories, the estimate should include five new and five revised courses for each year.

The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 


1.   Agency and Contracting Activity:  The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Grants and Training, the Preparedness Directorate, Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP),  Anniston, Alabama, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.


2.   Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  The CDP requested approval to solicit for a specific "brand name" purchase, installation and training for a Motorola MCC 7500 IP Dispatch Console Radio System for the CDP Operations Center.  The Motorola System is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  This system would enhance the current CDP Motorola XTL5000 Consolette Base Station, 800 MHz emergency services radio system capabilities that is in use in the CDP Operations Center. 


3.   Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is for the purchase, installation and training for the Motorola MCC 7500 IP Dispatch Console Radio System.  The Motorola MCC 7500 is a compatible and integrated component with the ASTRO 25 Trunking System and is fully compatible and can be integrated with the existing CDP 800 MHZ radio system for continued interoperability and effective communications.  The MCC 7500 will connect directly to the IP (Internet Protocol) network without interface boxes, digital voice gateways, or backroom electronics. In addition, the MCC 7500 does not require a Central Electronics Bank (CEB).  This system will allow the CDP to continue to be compatible with the local emergency management community. This "brand name" Motorola, is the only known source that can provide the equipment, upgrades and integration for this system.  


4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (5) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".


5.  Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Required Use of the Authority Cited.  The CDP emergency communication system was upgraded in 2005 with the Motorola XLT 5000 Consolette Base Station, 800 MHz emergency services radio system. This is the only radio system that currently provides the critical interoperability and communications between the CDP and the Calhoun County Emergency Management community during emergency operations.  The CDP's  radio system uses and takes advantage of the Calhoun County Emergency Radio system and infrastructure.  The CDP benefits from the Calhoun County FCC license, frequency and access to other emergency services.   


The Calhoun County Emergency Management community is in the process of upgrading their current system to a Motorola ASTRO 25 Trunking System. In order for the CDP to continue to communicate effectively and preclude any delays in the time of crisis, the CDP system has to be compatible with the Calhoun County Emergency Management system. The Motorola MCC 7500 is a compatible and integrated component with the ASTRO 25 Trunking System that can be fully compatible and integrated with the existing CDP 800 MHZ radio system.  


Integration of the MCC 7500 positions with the current radio system would enable full participation in end-to-end voice encryption for secure communication, priority handling of emergency calls, and agency partitioning. 


6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Efforts have been made to identify other contractors for this requirement by synopsizing this requirement in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested Motorola dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the acquisition.


7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon sufficient competition obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps and the vendor's commercial product price list.


8.  Description of Market Research.  Upon initial receipt of this requirement, a market survey was conducted to determine if this requirement could be solicited among small businesses under the GSA Schedule.  It was determined that this was a new state-of-the art product and was not on GSA schedule with Motorola or its suppliers.  Based upon this information, market research was limited to the Motorola Government Sales Representative exploring options that would provide an upgrade to the existing CDP system and be compatible with the upgraded system to be installed within the Calhoun County emergency management community.


9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
As an integral member of the Calhoun County emergency management community it is essential that equipment used by the CDP be compatible with the equipment used by the local emergency management community. To do otherwise would jeopardize the CDP's ability to interact and communicate effectively with the local emergency management community.  If the CDP cannot effectively communicate and interact in a time of crisis, it would significantly impact safety and human life.


10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is Motorola and its dealers/distributors. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.


11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.   No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition will be taken, as the Motorola "brand name" MCC 7500 IP Dispatch Console Radio System is the only known system capable of satisfying this agency?s requirement. 


12.  Contracting Officer's Certification.

I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional indexing services on a sole source basis from Chinese Academy Medical Sciences (CAMS), Beijing, China, under authority of FAR 6.302, for a continuing stream of indexed foreign articles from biomedical journals for inclusion in MEDLINE.  The staff of the Institute of Medical Information, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) has nearly twenty years performed indexing for MEDLINE of biomedical journals published in China.  The staff of CAMS is uniquely qualified to perform this indexing because of their knowledge of the Chinese language and knowledge of Chinese medicine. 

Contractor will index life science journal articles by applying Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) describing the content of each article, following procedures and policies contained in established NLM guidelines, including the NLM indexing Manual, MeSH annotations, and other NLM generated indexing aids such as Technical Memoranda.  Indexers will use NLM's web-based online indexing system to add subject headings to the online record for each article.  Indexers will access the online record for each article and review the descriptive data provided for each one (pagination, language, authors, author affiliation and title).  The major effort involves the intellectual analysis of the article for subject content and the application of appropriate subject headings, publication types and qualifiers drawn from MeSH.  The online indexing system contains many validation programs to detect real or potential errors.  Indexers will respond to "Error" or "Warning" messages generated by the system.

CAMS will continue to provide indexing services to NLM for the indexing life science journals MEDLINE Project.  Based on CAMS's knowledge, expertise, skills and project workflow on the indexing life science journals MEDLINE Project, CAMS is the only known and capable source to continue this project.  

The purchase order term will be January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 with options for four (4) successive one-year periods.  

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services requirement as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information and staffing criteria.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the 3M-AIT Passport Reader.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the 3M-AIT Passport Readers to support Consular posts overseas.  3M-AIT Passport Readers have been deployed in all Consular Systems Modernization installations since the inception of the program. Additional units are primarily required at this time to replace any existing AIT PAX readers in need of maintenance, thus extending the life of the VISA Quality Assurance procedure.  The reader was initially selected because the travel document production systems with which it is used required an accurate, reliable instrument to perform quality assurance checks on the OCR zones of visas and passports, thereby validating their machine readability. The reader enables Consulates to generate travel documents that will be accepted and accurately interpreted at any port of entry employing mechanized processing systems. This is of great importance since it eliminates or minimizes incidences of false interpretations of bearer identification data.  Such “mis-reads” can result in the refusal of entry or passage to qualified bearers, impede the processing flows at ports of entry, and otherwise embarrass the U.S. Government. <BR><BR>The AIT reader was selected following a very lengthy market survey and evaluation process.  It was found to be the only device of its type able to meet the Bureau’s specifications.  Features of the unit evaluated are as follows: -Reads International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and non-ICAO compliant documents -Performs quality assurance analysis -Multi-function magnetic stripe reader and OCR -Two RS-232 serial ports and one universal serial bus (USB) port -Remotely upgradeable software -Rugged, no-moving parts design Due to these factors, the QA modules of travel document production systems were designed around the AIT readers. The selection of any other type or make of reader may put the functionality of overseas visa, passport, and border crossing card systems at risk. Such measures will necessitate the re-engineering of all U.S. travel document issuance systems and will significantly increase the Government’s costs.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested 3M-AIT Passport Readers without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the 3M-AIT Passport Readers because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The 3M-AIT Passport Reader has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the readers soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment similar to the 3M-AIT Passport Readers in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year. <BR><BR>

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted and incorporate Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal, and extend the due date for quotations.

1) Technical questions and responses are hereby provided:

Question 1:
Please define high purity nitric acid.  We think it means lab grade but want to be sure.

Answer 1: The purity of the Nitric Acid must be ACS Certified. 

Question 2:
Is there anything more specific on packaging?

Answer 2:
Per the solicitation the bottles must be shipped in a manner that will prevent contamination.

Question 3: 
There will be random tests performed.  What are the pass/fail criteria?

Answer 3:
See answer to question 6.

Question 4: 
Will there be a Government inspection at our place?

Answer 4:
No

Question 5: 
Is this a bottle that is currently being supplied to the researcher by another vendor?  If so, could you provide me with the name of the vendor and their product code so that I can match their specifications?  Is there an NSN number for the item?  This would be the easiest way to address the requirements.

Answer 5:
Bottle shall be Nalgene, Manufacturer Part Number 382099 or equal, with the following salient characteristics; high density polyethylene, polypropylene screw closures, cylindrical shape, 250 ml.

Question 6: 
If this is a new product request, I need more specific information regarding the cleanliness specification.  The solicitation specifies a cleaning process that can certainly be followed.  What concerns me is the statement that the bottles will be tested for trace elements (Na, K, and Ca); however, the acceptance limits for the trace elements have not been specified.  I would like to avoid a situation in which the bottles are cleaned according to the specified process but then are deemed unacceptable based on criteria that have not been specified.  Is it possible to clarify the acceptance limits for the trace elements or otherwise clarify the acceptance criteria?
 
Answer 6:
For acceptance testing, we will fill a selected number of bottles with deionized water, let them soak for 24 hours and then analyze them by ICP-OES for Na, K, and Ca.  To be acceptable, the concentrations must be below .1 ppm.

Question 7:
The solicitation also specifies that the bottles must be air dried in a Class 1 Clean Area.  Once again this is not a problem.  I am concerned that this requirement implies the need for a particulate cleanliness level for the containers; yet, no such criteria have been specified.  Is it possible to clarify whether there is a particulate cleanliness requirement, or whether the Class 1 drying is the sole criteria in this regard?

Answer 7:
Class 1 drying is the sole requirement.

2) The following FAR provision is hereby incorporated:

FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal (August 1999)

 (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as ?brand name or equal,? the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government?s needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that ?equal? products must meet are specified in the solicitation. 
(b) To be considered for award, offers of ?equal? products, including ?equal? products of the brand name manufacturer, must? 
(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; 
(2) Clearly identify the item by? 
(i) Brand name, if any; and 
(ii) Make or model number; 
(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and 
(4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. 
(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate ?equal? products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. 
(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. 
(End of provision) 

The due date for quotations is hereby extended to December 8, 2006 12:00 PM (Noon).

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO POST ANSWERES TO QUESTIONS REQUESTED BY VENDORS WHO WISH TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL TO THIS SOLICIATION.  THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED:

How will the proposals be evaluated?
We will evaluate the receivers based on what supplies the best fit and value for our TM needs.
Will all the receivers be the same? 
Yes, we will start receiving SOQPSK by the end of FY07 and by the end of FY08 will be receiving mostly SOQPSK. 
CPM is still considered to be a minority but we need all of the receivers to be able to receive and demodulate legacy and ARTM Tier I&II waveforms.
When will Eglin need hardware to perform the operation evaluation? 
We plan to have people on site the week of Dec 11, 06. This date will be determined by arrival of a TM transmitter. The vendor needs to bring one TM Receiver and a PC to setup the Receiver over Ethernet.

Frequency calls out 1700-1850. ARTM Upper L band is specified as 1710-1850 MHz? Which is correct? 
1710-1850
The non-ARTM demodulators called out are PM, BPSK, QPSK, OQSPK. Do you also need to handle sub-carriers while demodulating FM, PM, BPSK?
Yes, Ref. IRIG106 chapter 3.
You require OQPSK demodulation which is offset QPSK ? this is just the I and Q channels being 90 degrees out of phase. Are the data rates for the two channels the same?
Yes
Also, the data is not interleaved again, but is left separate on each channel; is this correct?
No, Refer to IRIG106 concerning SOQPSK-TG (ARTM Tier I). 
Do you expect to have different data rates on the I and Q channel for AQPSK demodulation?
No. 
IRIG spec says ARTM Tier I demodulation only works from 1 Mbps and above. Do you need SOQPSK to work below 1 Mbps?
No, current transmitted TM is expected to conform to the IRIG106 specs.
How many outputs are required? 
I am not sure what outputs you are referring to. The receiver must auto-track an antenna so it needs AM outputs. We also require 70 MHz IF for each channel and so on. We do not need IF outputs for recording to tape. BNC connectors are preferred. RJ-45 connector preferred for the Ethernet 100Base-TX. Are all of the outputs of your receiver built to order? If so, would this equipment still be considered COTS? 
Is only the combined demodulated PCM data required ? or will you also require the two separate channels. 
We need outputs from each of the receivers, and also the combined output.  If the receivers are individually capable of being tuned, we will surely have a need to use them as separate receivers from time to time.  If we don't have outputs from the individual receivers, then we lose that option.
Do you have a block diagram of the receiver detailing the outputs expected?
No, We plan adapt to the manufacture?s standard.
