<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR LOW COST MILITARY GPS. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals. The work will involve an initiative to impact the cost, performance, and domestic availability of components for hand-held military GPS receivers, the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR). The awardee is expected to comply with government performance specifications and quality levels, and to fully qualify new or expanded production capabilities in order to satisfy DoD requirements. The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a contract or a Technology Investment Agreement, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Rockwell Collins, 400 Collins Road North East, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498. Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to create a domestic production source for critical GPS receiver components at a domestic supplier. This initiative will focus on the hand held military GPS receivers, DAGR. Additionally, qualification work with Government agencies will be required to ensure government product requirements are met. Note: For this program, the offeror must be a domestic, high volume producer of hand held military GPS receivers, namely Defense Advanced GPS Receivers (DAGR's), and must be able to demonstrate significant marketing/customer sales experience with military GPS receivers. The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 18 months. Key tasks will include: Create a domestic source for critical military GPS receiver components; provide a plan for operational efficiency improvements, product enhancements, and quality improvements to meet Government user needs; provide an analysis of the military GPS receiver marketplace; develop and implement customer product qualification plans, develop a comprehensive strategic business plan and a marketing plan for both Government and commercial applications. The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source" or "DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b)," based on the aforementioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government. Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience. It shall identify the offeror's current production capacity for hand held military GPS receivers, namely DAGR's. Current customers and product applications will also need to be identified. Documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered along with market share. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of Government military customers that currently utilize the offeror's DAGR products. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at ‘http://www.dodsbir.net/submission’ following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at ‘http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation’.  Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms. Questions may be directed to the SBIR/STTR Help Desk at (866) 724-7457 or Mr. Michael Caccuitto at (703) 588-8610, or by e-mail: michael.caccuitto@osd.mil or Ms. Amy Smith, Contracting Officer at (937) 255-0493, e-mail amy.smith@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a single source requirement for the acquisition of hardware and software items for the digital receiver portion of a prototype system developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)/Lincoln Laboratories (LL), from Vaisala, Inc./SIGMET Westford Operations (SIGMET), Westford , Massachusetts.  This acquisition is in support of the FAA's upgrade of the Radar Data Acquisition (RDA) and Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) system.
MIT/LL, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRC) under United States Air Force (USAF) Contract FA8721-05-C-0002, accomplishes the design, development, programming, and delivery of engineering prototype equipment.  The FAA has an Interagency Agreement (DTFA01-93-Z-02012) with the USAF for MIT/LL to develop a prototype system in support of the FAA's upgrade of the RDA and DSP for the TDWR system.  In support of the FAA's TDWR application, MIT/LL acquired, adapted, and programmed SIGMET's commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, Digital IF Receiver and Signal Processor System.  
A formal market analysis was conducted for the development of the prototype system and equipment.  The development of the prototype system has been an ongoing effort by MIT/LL and its subcontractor, SIGMET, for eight (8) years, and it is in the final stages of development.  The source code changes to SIGMET's RVP8 are proprietary and therefore are not releasable.   
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with SIGMET, Westford, Massachusetts, in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection.  This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Loan Guarantee Program Office (CF-1.3) intends to award a sole source contract to Moody?s Analytics of New York, NY to acquire a subscription to LossCalc.  The requirement provides a one-year subscription to LossCalc for 30 users from the date of award.  LossCalc will be used to estimate loss given default (LGD) rates for individual projects.  The LGD calculated by LossCalc will be used as an input into the DOE's Credit Subsidy Model which is used to estimate the Credit Subsidy Cost for each project.  Under the LGPO program, the Credit Subsidy Cost is expected to be paid by the borrower and is, in essence, a loan loss provision covering anticipated risks associated with the project. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i).  This is a notice of intent and not a request for  competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA) has a requirement for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a non-competitive award to Ms. Margaret Grisius, 1206 Stable Gate Court, McLean, VA 22102, to continue to provide ongoing support services for NIDCR/Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB).  The Contractor will continue to conduct oral medicine evaluations required by the Sjogren’s Syndrome Clinic (SSC) as specified on the statement of work.  

 

Statement of Work: 

Background:  The MPTB conducts research to immune medicated salivary gland inflammatory disorders, especially Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), which affects at least one million Americans.  Women are affected nine times more frequently than men.  The disorder results in damage to exocrine tissues resulting in decreased saliva production with attendant problems of caries, tooth loss, candidiasis and other oral complications.  The disease also involves the other exocrine tissues resulting in dry eyes as well as general mucosal and cutaneous dryness.  The disorder may be associated with systemic manifestations such as arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, and renal tubular acidosis and is considered to fall within the spectrum of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. It may occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic diseases and is then designated as secondary SS.  When SS occurs alone, it is referred to as primary SS.  In addition, there is a 44-fold increase in the risk of lymphoma in SS patients compared with the general population.  The SSC, MPTB evaluates approximately 400 SS patients per year.  These patients require saliva collection and, often, labial salivary gland biopsies to confirm the diagnosis or follow up on problems.  SS patients often experience oral complications that require the evaluation of a dentist with substantial experience in the oral medicine as it pertains to dry mouth in general, and SS, in particular.  Ms. Grisius, has the requisite experience in SS and its complications to evaluate and manage patients seen in the SSC.  In addition, she understands well the procedures performed and the data collected in the Clinic.  The assistance and consultation of Dr. Grisius is essential to the smooth running and productivity of the Clinic at this time.  She has been providing this service for the past three years.  Contractor Requirements:  1) The contractor will consult one to one and a half days per week, according to schedule and load of patient visits.  2) The contractor will conduct oral medicine evaluations, including screening examinations, saliva collection, labia minor salivary gland biopsies and other examinations and procedures required by the current and future SSC protocols.  3) The contractor will notify the Chief of the SSC and the Research Nurse Coordinator, or alternate at least two weeks in advance, if unable to consult pm schedule days, preferably by email, but if that is not possible, by telephone.  4)  This contract may be terminated with 30 days notice, given in writing, by either the contractor or the Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch, NIDCR, NIH.  And 5) the contractor will provide consulting services, as specified above.  Reporting Requirements: The contractor will produce a hand-written or computerized record of the evaluations and procedures as required by the Medical Records Department, Clinical Center NIH.  In additions, the contractor will enter and manipulate clinical data as assigned.  The contractor will report all findings to the Chief of the SSC to assure the best patient care and alert him of any problems.  Inspections:  The work will be observed and reports will be evaluated at the discretion of the Chief of the Sjogren’s Syndrome Clinic, or other NIDCR or Clinical Center professional staff as needed.  The contractor will be paid monthly from June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009 for not more than one and a half days per week.  Payment will only be applied for days of service actually provided.

 

The Contract period of performance is from June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009.

 

The facility is located at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. 

 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the contractor has the experience, knowledge and is familiar with the NIDCR ongoing protocol.  An award to any other source for the continuation of this project would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

 

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

 

This requirement is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990, size standard $6.5 Million.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the Clinical Cardiology Section of the Translational Medicine Branch, intends to negotiate with Mitchell Medical Analysts, LLC, to continue to provide Translational Medicine Branch physician staff with analysis of ambulatory monitoring recordings.   

The primary objective of this requirement is to continue to provide technical Cardiology services to analyze ambulatory Holter monitor recordings for arrhythmias for patient care and research studies,  enabling the physician to make accurate diagnoses and to determine the appropriate course of treatment for patients  evaluated by the Clinical Cardiology Section of the Translational Medicine Branch/DIR/NHLBI 

Background Information:
The Clinical Cardiology Section of the Translational Medicine Branch/DIR/NHLBI performs ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring using specialized recording devices (Holter monitor, Spacelabs Healthcare/Del Mar Reynolds) for clinical research and patient care purposes. These recordings are necessary to determine causes of symptoms (episodic lightheadedness, loss of consciousness), to assess pacemaker function, and to determine risk of sudden death in patients with heart disease. The incumbent must be an experienced cardiovascular technician, who will analyze Holter monitor recordings that are generally 24-48 hours in duration. A detailed analysis and official report of the recording is generated for each study, which is then proofed and approved by the requesting cardiologist. The incumbent must be available at specified times for discussion of study findings.

Place of performance:
The work will be performed on a computer system that is located in the Hatfield Clinical Research Center of the National Institutes of Health, Building 10-CRC, Room 5-1462, in order to facilitate interaction with senior Translational Medicine Branch and Clinical Center staff. The Cardiology Branch will provide the equipment needed to analyze the Holter monitor recordings. The work will also be performed off-site, with remote access to Holter recordings downloaded to a server in the Clinical Center using a government encrypted laptop as a dummy terminal.

Contractor Requirements:
The task to be performed is the reading and analysis of ambulatory Holter monitoring tapes using a Spacelabs Healthcare/Del Mar Reynolds computer with specialized software. located in an office in the 5 NE corridor of the Clinical Research Center. The contractor must have at least 2 years experience reading Holter monitor tapes (at least 500 tapes) and be able to discuss findings with the Translational Medicine Branch physician staff.

 
Requirements and Deliverables:
A data analysis report will be generated and given to the requested physician. It is anticipated that approximately 45 tapes will be read and analyzed per month, depending on research and clinical demands.

The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB-{HL}-2008-110-DDC

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.

The estimated level effort for this requirement is not expected to exceed 889 hours for a one year period (twelve months).

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541690, with size standard of $6.5million.

Through noncompetitive procedures, Mitchell Medical Analysts was awarded a purchase order to continue to provide ongoing support services in the reading and analysis of 45 Holter monitor recordings per month.  Mitchell Medical Analysts, LLC, continues to perform this service with a high degree of efficiency.  Mitchell Medical Analysts, LLC has already demonstrated a commitment to providing excellent service to the Translational Medical Branch.   If the award was issued to another source, the new source would require extensive training on the software.  As a result, there would be disruption of the workflow, resulting in an increase in the turnaround time.  This would be problematic for some of the clinical studies, which require analysis to be performed in a timely manner as medication administration or admission to clinical studies may be based on the results of the analyses. Training a new source on the software and validating their analyses would result in an additional cost to the Government, not expected to be recovered through competition.

The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

 
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses to this notice will be reviewed in accordance with the following criteria: 

(1) Demonstrated knowledge and understanding of electrocardiograms and arrhythmia analysis from an ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) recording. (2) Available to perform the analysis of the Holter monitor recordings in a timely manner  (3) Knowledge of Federal, NIH and NHLBI policies, procedures, rules and regulations regarding patient confidentiality and patient care.  (4) Demonstrated extensive experience as a Holter Monitor analyst on the Spacelabs Healthcare/Del Mar Reymonds software. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct the competitive procurement.
 
Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-{HL}-2008-110-DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition Center,   Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>It is the intent of the government to issue a contract to Consolidated Work Opportunities, Inc. (CWOI) of Havelock, NC on a sole-source basis to provide Industrial Production Support Services as required by the Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC.  The purpose of the sole-source contract is to bridge a gap in service pending the solicitation, evaluation, and award of a long-term contract.  

FRC East is a DoD Aviation Maintenance Repair Facility that provides repair of assigned airframes, engines and components.  Assigned  airframes include primarily rotary wing and vertical take off variants that are currently front line weapon systems in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The Industrial Production Support Services under the planned contract include Supply Support for operation of the facility Automated Storage/Automated Retrieval System.  Proper operation of the system is critical in order to ensure timely parts support, as well as moving assemblies to be repaired from storage back to the production shops as the required parts for repair are received.  A gap in these services would severly impact the ability of the FRC East to meet it’s mission of repairing and overhauling DoD aircraft and aircraft parts and assemblies.  The services shall be performed at the FRC East facility located on the MCAS Cherry Point, NC.     

CWOI is the current provider of these services under contract N00146-08-P-9000, which will expire on 10 June 2008.  A competitive follow-on requirement is planned in order to establish a long-term contract for these services.  However, there is insufficient time to award a competitive contract prior to the expiration date of the current contract. 

The continuation of this effort can only be accomplished reasonably and without impairing continued support through the issuance of a sole source contract to the incumbent.  The bridge contract will provide for the required support from 11 June 2008 through 10 December 2008.  In addition, the contract will contain one (1) three-month option period to be exercised if any delays occur in awarding the follow-on contract.  

Inquiries relating to this synopsis should be sent to Sherry Kelly, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to sherry.l.kelly@navy.mil or  by phone at (252)464-7031; or, Rodney Ange, Contracting Officer, via e-mail to rodney.ange@navy.mil or by phone at (252)464-7032 on or before 12 May 2008.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a fixed priced contract to retrofit BQM-34 aerial target vehicles for the incorporation of an upgraded integrated avionics unit (UIAU) for the autopilot of the BQM-34.  This contract will have a base of retrofitting a qty of ten (10) BQM-34 units for FY 2008 and priced options for FY 2009 qty 20 and FY 2010 qty 20.  The UIAU will be identical to the UIAU for the BQM-74E aerial target vehicles.  The retrofit pricing will include all labor, material, and indirect costs associated with upgrading the units.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate the proposed contract on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman Corporation, Rancho Bernardo, CA.  Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor that developed this UIAU for the BQM-74E and BQM-34 aerial target systems.  Only Northrop Grumman has the technical expertise, understanding of the system engineering, software architecture, and system integration required to take a common IAU and integrate this common unit into a variety of aerial target systems, including the BQM-34.  These target systems (BQM-34 and BQM-74E) employ a wide range of technology that requires sophisticated and dedicated knowledge of these specific aerial target systems.  In addition much of the technical data required to perform this effort is Northrop Grumman proprietary data.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Navy anticipates the award to be a firm fixed price contract. 

Note 22 applies.

MDC has the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data required to respond to this requirement without substantial duplication of costs and undue delays to the program.          

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in response to this notice.  Responses without a return address, mailing address, and company telephone number will not be recognized.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to issue a competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ) in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13, to acquire expertise to conduct research on a new method of computing aircraft noise.  This noise research will provide a better understanding of aviation noise problems.  Prominent in this research will be the use of the Crank-Nicholson Parabolic Equation (PE) method to predict the effects of meteorology, finite-impedance ground, and uneven terrain on sound propagation.  This noise research is expected to provide significant improvements in the prediction of low frequency noise levels in the noise models such as the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT)/Integrated Noise Model (INM).  This will also lead to improvements in AEDT/INM computations in areas with complex terrain and meteorology, such as coastal airports and in the U.S. National Parks.  A complete statement of work will be set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).  RFQ issuance will be on or about May 12, 2008.

<a href="mailto:pat.davis@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC, Acquisition Center - Washington</a>
<DESC>The US Army CECOM Life Cycle Management Command, Acquisition Center Washington announces the issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sponsored by the U. S. Army Communications-Electronics Command Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Army Power Division.  This announcement provides only a synopsis of the BAA.  The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria is available at the CECOM LCMC Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/.  In order to be able to access the BAA and submit a proposal a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible.<BR><BR>This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Potential offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.  Any resultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements.  <BR><BR>This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the CERDEC Army Power Division.  CERDEC Army Power Divisions is responsible for the applied research and development of power, storage, and distribution technologies that when applied as a system will support Army quality of life, field-based operations, combat vehicles, weapons systems, surveillance techniques, and communications platforms.  The Government expects multiple awards spread over multiple technologies as a result of this Topic.  Each award will have a value of no more than $2M, and a period of performance of between twelve (12) and eighteen (18) months.  The objective of this effort is to support current forces, the HI-POWER program, and intelligent tactical grids; it is focused on mobile power sources and distribution systems in the 2-200kW range.  HI-POWER is envisioned as a true grid system that allows multiple-paralleling of power sources, plug-and-play connection of sources and loads, and seamless integration of AC and DC systems, to include alternative energy systems.  Current tactical electric power sources are designed primarily with deployability as the main criteria, with weight, volume, and initial cost as key features.  As CERDEC is supporting mobile forces, alternative energy systems must, and will continue to be, evaluated on the basis of weight and volume, with kiloWatt/kilogram and kW/liter as the quantifying metrics.  Fuel use is equivalent to delivered energy, based on both the specific fuel and the conversion efficiency of the power source, and quantified as kW-hours/kg.  In the current force, all tactical electrical power is supplied by Military Standard diesel generator sets.  These units typically produce between .02-.03 kW/kg, or about .008-.02 kW/l on a volume basis, and use fuel at the rate of approximately 3-4 kW-hrs/kg.  Smaller diesel sets typically show slightly worse performance than larger sets.  The smallest current diesel set is a 2 kW unit.  Larger generator sets have also shown initial purchase costs of roughly $500/W; this figure may increase to over $2000/W for smaller units.  This figure includes documentation, testing, and logistics support, and therefore does not reflect simple hardware costs, but it does indicate the approximate purchase costs of current hardware.  The Army does not envision that these sets will be replaced, but use of alternative energy systems and energy recovered from other sources may allow fewer sets, smaller sets, or less operating hours.  In addition, generator part-load efficiency is significantly worse than at full load; scenarios and technologies that match capacity to loads and limit part-load operation can show significant fuel savings<BR><BR>Possible areas of development include, but are not limited to:<BR><BR>Photovoltaic panels<BR>	flexible panels with efficiencies greater than 10%<BR>	high-efficiency/low-cost, self-deploying solid panels<BR><BR>Energy recovery<BR>	Mobile waste-to-energy systems, to include biomass generation; both direct (e.g., 	algae to hydrogen) and indirect (e.g., wood scraps feeding gasifier)<BR>	Advanced thermoelectric materials <BR>	Solar collectors; improved performance and self-deploying <BR>	Co-generation and heat-driven cooling<BR><BR>All of these technologies are currently available in multiple forms.  The Government desires to only pursue those proposals that advance these or other technologies beyond their current state.  For example, flexible photovoltaic panels with greater than 10% efficiency or fixed panels with greater than 25% efficiency would be required.  The Government has purposely not included wind and water-based systems in the above list; although these are viable technologies, the Government feels that they are both geographically limited and very mature, and therefore of limited interest to this program. <BR><BR>Off-the-shelf (OTS) commercial hardware is not sought for this effort; the Army is aware of current commercial capabilities and desires to improve upon available performance.  However, proposals that offer innovative packaging and integration of OTS components may be considered for award.  <BR><BR>In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  Proposals shall be submitted in electronic format via the CECOM LCMC Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP).  Proposals shall be submitted via electronic media using Microsoft Office products (i.e., Microsoft  Word, Powerpoint and Excel) and Adobe Acrobat in separate files for each proposal volume as set forth below. All information pertaining to a particular volume shall be confined to that file.  A cover letter should be provided to include a short summary of the proposal, the Technical and Contracting point of contacts (to include name, title, telephone number, fax number, and email address), proposed type of contract and total proposed amount.  There will be no formal request for proposal or any further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendments that may be published.  Amendments to this BAA will be issued through the IBOP.  Offerors may register for auto notification by registering for this specific BAA.  Offerors may submit questions related to this BAA electronically using the Question format available in the Army IBOP W909MY-08-R-0017 - BAA  Alternate Energy Technologies solicitation folder. Questions of a technical nature may be address to the project lead, specified below, until such time as a proposal has been submitted.  All questions of a contractual nature and all questions after proposal submission must be directed to the Contracting Office Point of Contacts specified at the IBOP.    All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas can change with little or no notice.<BR><BR>The point of contact for any questions related to technical issues prior to submission of proposals may be addressed to Mr. Frank Calkins via email at frank.e.calkins@us.army.mil.  The CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center Washington points of contact are Mr. Sabin Joseph, Contract Specialist, email:  sabin.joseph@us.army.mil and Ms. Patricia Davis, Contracting Officer, email: pat.davis@us.army.mil.  Please make sure that email message include the BAA RFP number within the Subject.

<DESC>I.  DESCRIPTION:<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (COE) Transatlantic Program Center intends to solicit names of United States construction firms, International construction firms or joint ventures interested in submitting a firm-fixed price offer for this project.  To be considered a construction firm, the firm must perform construction as a significant portion of its business.  A U.S. construction firm must be incorporated and have its corporate headquarters in the United States for a minimum of three years; shall have filed state and federal income tax declarations for a minimum of three corporate years within the preceding four-year period, having paid any applicable taxes determined to be due as a result of such filing; and employ U.S. citizens in key management positions.  To be considered a foreign firm, the firm must be a minimum of fifty-one percent foreign owned and an independently owned firm.  Performance and Payment Bonds or a Bank Letter of Guaranty will be required. The Government intents to award one contract for the IDIQ type contract in accordance with FAR 16.504.  The IDIQ contract consists of base year of $200 million and each two option year of $75 million.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 236220.<BR><BR><BR>II. PROJECT INFORMATION:<BR>This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract entails design, construction,<BR>and installation of overhead cover systems for selected high density gathering facilities at various locations in throughout the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility. This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract also includes upgrades to existing overhead cover systems and repair and replacement of damaged overhead cover systems for selected high density gathering facilities at various locations throughout the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility. Individual Task Orders will be issued which contain specific scope of work statements and technical criteria for the specific facility and country location. In general, an overhead cover system for primary facilities shall include E-Glass protection layers, concrete foundations, demo and retrofit of existing facility utilities and mechanical equipment as required, and installation of steel support structure and pre-detonation screen. All overhead cover systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with current U.S. and Host Nation Standards, building codes and as described in the individual task orders. <BR><BR><BR>III. CONTRACT PROCEDURES:<BR>This requirement will be firm-fixed price design-build contract.  This is a Best Value awarded acquisition using formal source selection procedures. The Best Value Tradeoff method will be used in order to select an offeror that is to be awarded a contract.  Pricing and non-pricing considerations will have approximately equal weight with one another in the selection process.  Non-pricing evaluation factors will also have approximately equal weight with one another in the evaluation and selection processes.  <BR><BR>(1) Non-Pricing considerations have approximately the same weight in the selection process as pricing considerations.  The three non-pricing evaluation factors to be rated are: (i), Management and Technical, (ii) Experience and (iii) Past Performance.  These three evaluation factors have approximately equal weight with one another in the selection process.  There are three subfactors associated with the evaluation factor of Management and Technical and two subfactors each pertaining to the evaluation factors of Experience and Past Performance.  The subfactors associated with the factor of Management and Technical are: (i) Management Capabilities, (ii) Technical Capabilities and (iii) Subcontracting.  The two subfactors associated with the evaluation factor of Experience are: (i) Prime Contractor Experience and (ii) Subcontractor Experience.  The two subfactors associated with the evaluation factor of Past Performance are: (i) Prime Contractor Past Performance and (ii) Subcontractor Past Performance. Each of these two sets of subfactors has approximately equal weights with one another in the evaluation and selection processes.   <BR><BR>(2) Pricing evaluation factors are completeness and reasonableness. Completeness of an offerors price proposal is to be evaluated by determining if all of the required prices and other information required by the Government furnished Proposal Schedule and Cost Breakdown Sheet have been proposed.  Reasonableness is to be determined by comparing an offerors proposed prices against the Governments estimated prices as contained within the IGE (or if applicable, the revised government estimate (RGE)) and by comparison with the prices proposed by the other offerors.  To the degree that the prices proposed by the various offerors merit such action, those proposed prices, or a portion of them, may be determined suitable for determining the market price of the solicitation project or portions thereof.  An offerors price proposal that compares favorably to the established market price may be determined as being reasonable even if that proposed price deviates significantly from the value of the of approved IGE.  Such a determination shall be based upon a full consideration of all pricing and non-pricing aspects involved. <BR><BR>(3) Contractors who plan well and who have experience accomplishing work in non-U.S. construction environments have proved historically to be the most successful in the accomplishment of work in TACs Area of Responsibility (AOR). Their improved performance also equates to secondary benefits to the government by reducing the Governments contract management and administrative costs. For these reasons, the Government has chosen the Best Value Tradeoff Process as the means of selecting an awardee for this acquisition matter.   <BR><BR><BR>IV. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  (See Section 00100 Bidding Schedule/Instructions to Bidders in the Solicitation.)  This is an electronic issued solicitation (tender).  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work to receive the solicitation should send a written request to Ms Debra A.

Security Laminate for Use in US Emergency Passport

Scope

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking a vendor to provide security laminates that will be part of the US Emergency Passport system.  This Request for Information (RFI) seeks information on the capabilities of security laminate producers in the areas of security feature creation, design, necessary form factor creation, testing and adjustment for use with predetermined materials and timely delivery and service.


Background

GPO is responsible for providing customer agencies with secure documents.  The GPO will purchase annually a security laminate suitable for use in the US Emergency Passport system.  The laminate will be applied over a data page label that has been manually affixed to page 2 in a 12 page booklet during a single pass through a booklet laminator.  See Carrier Construction section below.  Vendor shall provide any laminator temperature (upper or lower) limits. 

The laminate will be applied to the emergency passport in a normal office setting.  Creating a special environment for application is not possible.  The application will be performed by an employee trained to handle normal office tasks.  At most one hour of training will be allowed to teach such employees how to operate the equipment and apply the laminate.

After lamination, lamination must adhere to data page such that any removal attempt will be unequivocally evident.

After lamination, all optical features on data page must be clear and functional.

The laminate will be applied onto a cotton-fiber based security paper that will be printed with standard security offset inks.  

Laminate backing and cover layers, if any, need to be manually removed.

Laminate shelf life in uncontrolled conditions must be three years minimum.

Quantity

The GPO will purchase annually an amount necessary to meet the US State Department needs.  The approximate quantity of laminates will be 120,000.  Vendor shall provide lead times needed to respond to increased quantities, up to 300,000 annually.


Response Criteria

Keeping GPO’s and DOS’s goals in mind please provide a response that will help us determine what viable technologies are available.  There are several requirements that this project is attempting to meet.


Carrier Construction

The laminates should be delivered in a 3-Up format that is 7.5” x 16.5”.  There will be a perforated fold/tear out line in the center running the 16.5” dimension.  The carrier will be stitched into a 12 page booklet format. The laminates should be of “passport size” and be placed on the carrier at a 5.25” repeat.

Cost Estimate

Vendor shall be prepared to confidentially discuss cost estimates for provided laminates as described herein, including plant security, secure storage and shipment, warranty and any software licensing fees related.

Application Method

The application method will be by heat set passport booklet laminator.  It will be necessary to provide a ‘shim” to provide the proper pressure as it travels through the laminator.


Durability

The laminate must have an un-applied shelf life of at least 5 years.  After application the life cycle of the document is no longer than 2 years.


Security Features

There are several base security features that are required, these include solvent sensitivity, a controlled UV response, and the laminate must be highly frangible after application into the book.

In this response please define two level 1 overt security features, two level 2 security features, and two level 3 forensic level security features.  

These aforementioned features are not being specified so that each respondent will have the opportunity to present their own document security strategy in this proposal.


Samples

If possible please submit representative samples that show each security feature you reference in prior areas of the proposal.

Alternate Proposal Considerations

If there is a laminate system that can be incorporated into a book system in a different manner as listed above, please forward those systems for consideration as well.  

The existing laminate implementation is not a limiting factor.  The only limiting factor is the equipment available in the field for personalization.  This includes a color inkjet printer and a passport booklet laminator.  No additional equipment should be required for field issuance in any alternate system proposal.

__________________________23 April 2008: The following clarification is offered to Industry regarding Foreign-Owned (FO) companies bidding on the JTC TRS contract. For a Foreign-Owned company to become eligible for award upon submittal of JTC TRS Proposal but no later than time of contract award, the following criteria must be met:
1)  For a company to bid as Prime, that is subject to Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) entity, they must be FOCI compliant by contract award;
2)  Prior to contract award of the JTC TRS contract, which requires access authorization(s) and which requires offerors/bidders and all tier parents, (i.e. tier parent means ultimate parent and any intervening levels of ownership, if the offeror/bidder is controlled by another organization), are required to submit complete, current, and accurate information, certification, and explanatory documentation which define the extent and nature of any relevant FOCI relationship over the offeror/bidder and tier parents for use by the Government in determining the risk presented by that FOCI.
3) A U.S. company is considered to be under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, whether or not exercised, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company's securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company in a manner which may result in unauthorized access to classified information or may affect adversely the performance of classified contracts. (see NISPOM. 2-301, for more specific details at this reference).

_______________________17 April 2008: For further clarification about Foreign-Owned companies and WPAFB Gate Entry Foreign Disclosure Office procedures, the following information is provided to Industry:  The requirement for a U.S. only company/U.S. subsidiary to be the Prime has not changed. Foreign National attendees are required to follow appropriate visit procedures for access to Wright-Patterson AFB.  All FN attendees will meet at Gate 1B, located on Springfield Street (near the Air Force Museum) for escort to the sessions.

*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances – the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

•	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
•	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree (B.Eng) from an accredited institution in Civil Engineering is desired at a minimum, Master’s Degree (MSCE) preferred.
•	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
•	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
•	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
•	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
•	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent’s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<DESC>The SSC transmission systems (separate port and starboard systems) will likely include gearboxes, clutches, AC generators, and shafting and couplings.  The transmission systems will be used to reduce the prime mover speed (input) to transmit power to air propulsors, bow thrusters and lift fans (one propulsion system and one lift system on each side of the craft), and may consist of parallel axis, bevel, planetary gear configurations, etc.  Potential power systems include prime movers in the approximate range of 4,000-5,500 SHP @ 12,000-16,000 RPM or 10,000-14,000 SHP @ 7,000-8,000 RPM.  Maximum output speeds are likely to range from 1,200 to 2,200 RPM.
NSWCCD is interested in information on existing reduction gearbox designs (for ACVs, yachts, helicopters, etc.) that could be incorporated into the range of potential power systems described above.  ACVs require lightweight, compact and reliable reduction gearboxes.  Each gearbox must incorporate a debris monitoring system to detect and relay wear metal information to the operator.  All SSC gearbox designs must be certified in accordance with ANSI/AGMA standards for high speed marine gears with an expected MTBO goal between 3,000 and 12,000 hours.    
Responses

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is conducting a market survey of all potential sources that have clutch technologies or existing systems that can be integrated into marine power transmission system designs.  The clutches should be currently in production or already in development and be capable of being in production by 2011.  This market survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  The information provided will assist NSWCCD in understanding the clutch options available for an air cushion vehicle transmission system in support of the Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) Program.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  However, respondents must be able to demonstrate that they currently produce clutches in the power ranges specified for commercial or other military applications.
Description
The following is a brief description of the general characteristics for the power transmission systems being considered.  The transmission systems (separate port and starboard systems) under consideration include gearboxes, clutches, electrical generators, shafting and couplings.  The transmission systems will be used to reduce the prime mover speed (input) to transmit power to air propulsors, bow thrusters and lift fans (one propulsion system and one lift system on each side of the craft), and may consist of parallel axis, bevel, planetary gear configurations, etc.  Potential power systems include prime movers in the approximate range of 4,000-5,500 SHP @ 12,000-16,000 RPM or 10,000-14,000 SHP @ 7,000-8,000 RPM.  Maximum output speeds are likely to range from 1,200 to 2,200 RPM.
The configurations of interest include manually operated disconnect clutches, overrunning clutches, or any other type or combination of clutches that would be deemed as feasible for marine transmission systems.  Each clutch system must incorporate a debris monitoring system to detect and relay wear metal information to the operator.  The resulting clutches will need to be certified to ANSI/AGMA standards for high speed marine applications with an MTBO goal between 3,000 and 12,000 hours.  
Responses
Responses to this survey should include supporting materials that demonstrates your companys experience, competence, and overall understanding of the requirements that NSWCCD has identified.  The following information is requested (please indicate whether the provided information is estimated or actual): 1) a description of the clutch configuration(s) (manual disconnect, overrunning, etc.), 2) the development timeline that can support the need date (2011), 3) the non-recurring engineering costs and unit production cost estimates identified for the clutch options, and identify sensitivity of production cost to volume of sales (quantity discounts),  4) minimum annual clutch purchases to sustain production,  5) clutch heat rejection,  6) clutch dimensions,  7) clutch weight,  8) technical constraints that are driving the ability to provide clutch configurations or adding technical or schedule risk,  9) estimated scope of maintenance while the clutches are in service on the craft, 10) plan for repair and overhaul of clutches as necessary during craft lifecycle.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is seeking qualified sources to provide a mobile Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) test trailer.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) serves as the Navys lead laboratory for electromagnetic environmental effects (E3) research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E).  This activity provides a full electromagnetic environment (EME) spectrum to ensure weapon systems are able to execute their mission in wartime EME and vendors are being sought to develop/integrate a mobile HERO test trailer for use during its RDT&E efforts.  The mobile HERO trailer shall have the capacity to perform a complete MIL-STD-464A Table 3A HERO test in one easy to transport and maintain package.  The HERO trailer should include a set of 5 high power radio frequency (RF) amplifiers, HERO instrumentation equipment, an internal shielded enclosure and all necessary accessory items, such as but not limited to transmitting antennas, waveguide, couplers, equipment shock-mounts and electrical connections.  The effort represents the Governments desire to obtain mobile HERO climate controller 53-foot air-ride trailer that is ready for EME testing from 100 kHz  18 GHz.  All high power RF amplifiers (amps) shall be shock-mounted and air-cooled.  The RF amp cooling input/output air should come from air external to the trailer.  The RF amps output power transmissions must be accessed externally; therefore, transmission lines should be routed from the RF amp to the external walls.  RF couplers and power meters are required to control and monitor the RF amp output.  The RF amps also require RS232 capability for optional remote operation.  The remote operation will be located in the Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) enclosure, which will also contain HERO instrumentation equipment.  The HERO instrumentation is used to correlate inert electrically initiated devices (EID) responses to test EMEs characterized by specific parameters, e.g., frequency, field strength, illumination angle, and polarization.  The shielded enclosure must have the 120V/60Hz power filtered.  The HERO trailer requires 208 and 480V input power receptacles (45KVA) to energize the equipment.  A step-down transformer is also required to provide 120V/60Hz; therefore, the trailer requires numerous electric runs, 120V/60Hz receptacles, lights and a breaker box.  Due to the heat generated by the operational RF amps, a climate control unit rated at 5 tons is required.  This announcement represents a general description of the requirements of this project, as there are many other specific necessities in developing a turn key mobile HERO trailer.  The following equipment should assist interested parties in their providing a response:  100KHz - 250 MHz 10KW CW power amplifier, IEEE/RS-232 interface, solid state air cooled,  fwd & reflected power meter; 80 - 1000 MHz 2KW CW power amplifier, IEEE/RS-232 interface; 1000 - 2500 MHz 1KW CW power amplifier, TWT amp; 2500 - 7500 MHz 2KW CW power amplifier, TWT amp; 7500 - 18000 MHz 1KW CW power amplifier, TWT amp; 100KHz - 250 MHz 10KW CW directional coupler; 80 - 1000 MHz 2 KW CW directional coupler; 1000 - 2500 MHz 10KW CW directional coupler; 2500 - 7500 MHz 10KW CW directional coupler; 7500 - 18000 MHz 10KW CW directional coupler; 26 - 250 MHZ 15KW log periodic antenna; 80 - 5000 MHZ 3-5KW log periodic antenna; 1000-4200 MHz 1.5KW@2500 MHz horn; HERO instrumentation data acquisition recorder; HERO instrumentation fiber optic signal conditioner; 53 Trailer; EMI Shielded Room; Waveguide; Power meters; and Miscellaneous (air conditioner, ducts, electrical, shock-mounts, etc).

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE AND BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION


In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), the Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) announce its intentions to award a sole source award under the Commercial Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) with Intelligent Search, Inc., 445 Hamilton Avenue, Suite 608, White Plains, NY  10601-1827.  The statement of work for this effort can be obtained via email to millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR OFFERS. This is a Notice of Intent. 

Brand Name Justification-This procurement will also be awarded in accordance with FAR authority FAR 6.302-1.

Reason for citing authority:  

The specific section of CICA allowing this action is set forth under 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) (2)(ii).  The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes make the supplies and services available from only one source.

Department of State, Verification and Compliance Bureau (VC/VO) uses NameSearch software to search for information using different variations on search elements.  This supports the arms transfer licensing process of the Compliance Office within the Directorate of Defense trade controls.   The software requires upgrades and updates for necessary patches, along with technical support.  VC/VO has made a substantial commitment for the NameSearch software, having license since 2001.  NameSearch is a copyrighted, commercial, off-the-shelf product, developed by Intelligent Search, Inc.  Intelligent Search, Inc. is the system owner and is the only company that has rights to modify the system source code.  The cost of switching to a competing software maintenance service was assessed and determined not in the Government’s best interest.  Procuring a different software system will have a severe impact on current users.  To procure another software package, personnel would require extensive retraining, and any new system would have to run parallel to the existing network to allow for data transference and testing.  Lost productivity and training costs would be unacceptably high and delay the department in fulfilling its mission.  In sum, it is in the Government’s best interest to continue to procure software maintenance services from Intelligent Search, Inc.  

Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. All inquiries must be addressed in writing to Ms. Millicent Hawkins, Contract Specialist, General Services Administration FEDSIM Civilian Acquisition 6354 Walker Lane, Alexandria, VA 22310 or via email at millicent.hawkins@gsa.gov. Responses to this notice must be received no later than 11:00 am EST Thursday, May 1, 2008. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. This notice may represent the only official notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of the EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration. This need is based on IV&Vs task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment. There are tools that this configuration (EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX4 in production but in a very small and cost effective package. The DMX800 provides the same functionality including command line interface. Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The EMS SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications. This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution. The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data). The EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000B 32-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Track Utilization (Thinning Project):  The Lincoln National Forests, Smokey Bear Ranger District has a requirement for the reduction of tree densities and slash Treatment on 95 acres that qualify as Wildland Urban Interface (WUI).  The purpose of work is to reduce fire and fuel hazards through reduction of tree density and subsequent slash treatment.  Woody Vegetation treatments may be completed by mechanized equipment (mastication).   Slash-treatment may be implemented through shredding of residue and slash on site that would be created as a result of thinning treatments.  See section M for treatment rating classification.

Scope of Work - The objective of this contract is to secure a complete set of services to accomplish Wildland Urban Interface treatment.  Tree density reduction will be accomplished by masticating less desirable trees and retaining those with good growth characteristics such as vigorous growth and no signs of disease.  The technical specifications contained in the performance standards were developed based on site-specific vegetative conditions.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

<p>Q: Can you describe your concept of operations - how do you plan to use the device and will the device always be within WiFi coverage?
<p>&nbsp;A: We plan to use the device to enhance surveillance during Air Shows and other flightline mass participant events. We will not always need WiFi. In fact WiFi will not be needed until approves WiFi AF wide.</p>
<p>Q: Can you confirm your solar power requirements? Based on our reading of your current requirements, the platform will not be able to sustain operations under solar power. You will always be on "shore" power. This approach is fine if it fits into your concept of operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A: Solar power is not mandatory. It is a great backup but not necessary. Shore power is fine.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Far Subpart 12.6, streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued using simplified acquisition procedures. This solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ). The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 811219.

Food and Drug Administration intends to award a competitive purchase order for a positioning track system. The system is needed for is Food and Drug Administration/Center for Devices and Radiological Health/ Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories/ Ionizing Radiation Measurements Laboratory (FDA/CDRH/OSEL/IRML).


A) General Description: A positioning track system is needed for a 320 kV X-ray unit that is used for calibrating radiation monitors for the FDA NVLAP accredited X-ray Calibration Laboratory. 

B) General Requirements 

The following Computer Control System and Hardware is needed to interface with an existing FDA 320 kVp Diagnostic X-ray System: 
	1) Positioning System: (controlled by Computer control system) 
Computer Controlled 3 Axis positioning system used to position a 0.9 x 0.5 meter platform with an accuracy of &#8804; ± 1 mm with a platform load of 100kg. The platform will hold ion chambers, phantoms, or survey meters to insure optimal centering and variability for setup in useful x-ray beam. 
	• X-Axis: ~9 meters long and parallel to X-Ray beam through out the full length  of  travel. 
	(The X-Axis must allow personnel easy access and maneuverability around the track for moving around the room) 
	• Y-Axis: 90 cm meter travel, horizontal and perpendicular to X-Ray beam 
	• Z-Axis: ~30cm travel, vertical and perpendicular to the X-Ray beam 
	2) Collimator (aperture) positioning and Filter positioning systems: 
(Controlled by Computer control system) 

The Collimator and Filter positioning systems are separate components, but because they both need to be located to insure good beam geometry they are listed together. The Collimator positioning system needs to be located to insure good beam geometry for the filter positioning system, the transmission monitor, and the survey meter or ion chamber. The beam must be collimated enough so that it does not interact with the Filter positioning holder by only hitting the filter material pack. The Vendor can manufacture the Collimator and Filter positioning system as a unit, but they must work independently. Components for the control system include, but may not necessarily be limited to the following: 
 
• Computer control Collimator positioning system that position ~6 separate lead collimators with apertures diameters of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1cm. 
Must be easy for FDA personnel to install different apertures, or an alternative that will allow flexibility of optimizing good beam geometry for 
• Computer controlled Filter positioning system that positions ~10 separate filters, and allows easily switching of groups of filters. 
Vender will need to modify FDA’s existing 100 mm square filters to fit in vendor provided filter positioning system. A filter shelf will also be needed for mounting additional filters 
• Bracket that will allow (FDA provided) transmission monitor to be mounted after the beam has exited the filter. 
3) Laser alignment system that defines the following: 
	a) the source to probe distance for a point that is defined at the center of the platform cart 
	b) additional variable distance laser that defines a point up to 5 cm in front of the platform cart 
	c) reference center of x-ray beam both vertically and horizontally 
	4) Computer control system: 

The control system is focused in the following areas: 
	• Equipment communication and positioning set up 
	• Ion chamber calibration 
	• Exposure rate calculation 
	• kVp, mA, and exposure time control 
	• Reading of the electrometer 
	• Statistical quality control monitoring so that limits of variability for selected or historical parameters are not exceeded 
	• Automated calibration report generation for individual test instruments 
Vendor shall adapt their control system software to FDA’s existing techniques and procedures. FDA has ownership and all rights to access and modify any source code that controls the X-Ray calibration system. Adequate documentation will be provided to verify that all requirements are met. The final product will meet ADA requirements. The control system program must be modular in design, allowing for easy modifications to the system. 

C) Detailed Description 

1) Positioning System 
The 320KV X-Ray beam centerline is 1.65 meter above and parallel to the floor. The Positioning System shall facilitate mounting and positioning instruments and phantoms in a stable, repeatable (±1mm) fashion in the center of the X-Ray beam. The system must be level and sturdy for the entire travel length, to insure positioning reproducibility for all axes. The positioning system needs to hold 100kg without significant deflection and have a minimum of backlash and side-play. The mounting platform needs to be a flat 
 
plate with an alignment grid engraved (1 cm grid). Mounting holes that are ¼”-20 SAE drilled and tapped in the plate in 10 cm intervals (starting 5 cm from the platforms edge) to allow jigs to be bolted to the platform. Platform size needs to be approximately ~ 90 cm x 50 cm. The Platform will need to support the 100kg without deflection. The positioning track shall be configured as a three axis system with a positioning accuracy of ± 1 mm designed primarily for positioning ion chambers for calibration. Each axis shall be operated via computer control from the control console and jog switches on the Positioning System (jog switches will be located on the right side of the Y-Axis assembly). (Note: The right side is from the perspective of the 320 kV X-Ray tube). Each axis will include a metric scale with an applicable axis pointer to manually confirm positioning. The X-Axis scale will need to be referenced to the Focal Spot of the X-Ray tube. 
Because the Positioning Track System will move up to 8.5 meters (X-Axis) and 0.9 meter (Y-Axis), a method for controlling the cables (data/control/signal/power) will be required. The cable management system must allow FDA personnel to easily add and/or remove cables as needed. 
Note: Not required but would be nice: the use of Absolute Encoders in the positioning circuit, so the positioning system would not have to seek a home (reference) switch with the loss of power. 
	• X-Axis: 

The X-Axis needs to allow the travel of the Y-Axis up to 8.5 meters away from the X-Ray source. Because the X-Axis travel utilizes most of the length of the room, the design must allowing easy personnel maneuverability. One Example that would work is tracks/rail that is mounted close to the floor (&#8804;15cm). The system must be level, sturdy, and centered to the useful beam for the entire length of travel, to insure positioning reproducibility and good beam geometry without having to readjust the y or z axis and by only changing collimation. The system will need to be aligned to keep the platform precisely leveled with the beam centerline. Overall track/rail length will be 9 meters; allowing 8.5 meters of Y-Axis (platform) positioning travel. This also allows space for the x-ray cabinet at one end. The Y-axis moves along the X-axis and is controlled via computer control from the control console and jog switches located on the right side of the Y-Axis frame. The X-Axis positioning accuracy needs to be &#8804; ± 1 mm (referenced from the X-Ray tube focal Spot). 
	• Y-Axis: 

The Y-Axis is a framework that moves on the X-Axis and is designed to places the Y-axis system (track/rails) approximately 40cm under the beam centerline. The Z-Axis platform is mounted to the Y-Axis system (tracks/rails). The Y-axis is ~2m long. The platform size shall be 0.9 m x 0.5 m. The Y-axis travel must provide adequate travel so that any part of the (Z-Axis) 0.9 m wide platform can be placed in the beam centerline. The bottom of the Y-Axis framework will have a shelf with minimum of 30cm vertical clearance. Located near the shelf will be 115 VAC 60 Hz 15A outlet or power strip connected to building power/outlet. The right side of the Y-Axis framework will include 
 
a method for mounting alignment Laser(s) to position the laser light horizontal and perpendicular to the X-Ray beam center line (~1.65 meters from the floor). 
(Note: The right side is from the perspective of the 320 kV X-Ray tube). The lasers will need to be able to be positioned up to 5cm in front of the platform and mark the full 40cm depth of the platform. The Y-Axis movement is controlled via computer control from the control console and jog switch located on the right side of the Y-Axis frame. The Y-Axis positioning accuracy needs to be &#8804; ± 1 mm to accurately indicate the distance from the referenced X-Ray source to the reference spot on the platform). 
	• Z-Axis: 

The Z-Axis moves on the Y-Axis rails and is positioned so that with the Z-Axis fully raised, will position the Platform 10cm below the X-Ray beam center line. With the Z-Axis fully lowered, it will position the Platform 40cm below the X-Ray beam center line. The vertical axis provides 30 cm of vertical movement for the Platform. 
Z-axis is controlled via computer control from the control console and jog switch located on the right side of the Y-Axis frame. 
The Z-Axis positioning accuracy needs to be &#8804; ± 1 mm (referenced to the X-Ray beam horizontal center line) 
2) Collimator (aperture) positioning and Filter positioning systems: 
(Controlled by Computer control system) 
Collimator (aperture) positioning system: 
The Collimator (Aperture) assembly must be designed to modify the beam diameter of the X-ray beam to provide good beam geometry for the various beam configurations required for calibrating and testing ion chambers, radiation monitors, survey meters, and phantoms. The computer controlled collimator positioning system positions ~6 separate lead collimators for energies up to 300 kV with apertures diameters of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1cm with a minimum positioning accuracy of ±1 mm. Individual apertures must be easy for FDA personnel to replace with different apertures. 
Filter positioning system: 
The filer is used to modify the spectral characteristics of the X-ray beam to meet the various beam codes required for calibrating instruments. The Computer controlled Filter positioning system positions the approximate center of the filter material in the center of the X-Ray beam. Filter thickness ranging from 0.1mm to 15mm in thickness. We are looking for a system that will position at least 10 filters and will allow easy switching of all ten 10 filters. Example: disk with 10 filter, remove current disk and insert separate disk with 10 different filters. 
Vender will need to modify FDA’s existing 100 mm square filters to fit in vendor provided filter positioning system. 
Note: After a filter is positioned, only the filter material shall be in the X-Ray beam path. None of the positioning system or material used to secure the filter material can be in the X-Ray beam path. (~7 cm diameter clearance is required) 
 
3) Laser alignment system: (self leveling) 
Allows technicians to determine the following: 
	• Fixed Cross hair laser, assist technician to position instrument on the platform 
	• Movable Cross hair laser that defines a point up to 5 cm in front of the platform 
	• Two line lasers that form a cross hair down the center of the X-Ray beam path. 
(Located on or near the filter positioning system) 
1st line laser to the side of X-Ray beam, mounted so the laser line is horizontal and down the center of the X-Ray beam path, this will indicate the X-Ray beams vertical center (~1.65 meters) 
2nd line laser above or below the X-Ray beam, mounted so the laser line is vertical and down the center of the X-Ray beam path, this will indicate the X-Ray beams horizontal center 

4) Description of Control System 
The vendor shall provide a rack mounted state of the art computer with necessary software and hardware to run the control system and program. Vendor shall interface their software to FDA’s existing techniques and procedures. The control software is powerful yet designed to be simple to use. The core program shall be a PC Windows-based program. It shall be very easy for an operator to use on a routine basis. Only information for routine use shall be presented to the operator, but easily available to the operator upon demand. Selection of options shall be clear and unambiguous. Status of all system components shall be shown in a concise display. The control software shall be designed on a modular approach for functions. The program shall have the ability to generate and print customer calibration reports on demand for calibrated test instrument with logo and letterhead, customer information and identification, and selected parameters relevant to each calibration point.

The Advanced Technical Exploitation Programs (ATEP) Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is comprised of the following four separate attachments: (1) Draft Performance Work Statement, (2) Draft Section H, (3) Draft Section L, and (4) Draft Section M.  Comments are due NLT 1500 local, 9 May 2008, and are to be sent to Ms. Joey Pence, ASC/PKESI, 2275 D St, Bldg 16, Rm 132, WPAFB, OH 45433-7228; e-mail:  joey.pence@wpafb.af.mil.




4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought synopsis isalso attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar 08 forsubmittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no other changes to the requirements for submittals.
   For more information on "ADVANCED TECHNICAL EXPLOITATION PROGRAM (ATEP)", please refer to: https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5549

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of the EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch.The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration.  This need is based on IV&Vs task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment.  There are tools that this configuration (EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX4 in production but in a very small and cost effective package.  The DMX800 provides the same functionality including command line interface.  Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The EMS SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications.  This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution.  The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data).The EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000B 32-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Jeffery Merlino215-897-7289jeffery.merlino@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is hereby conducting a market survey of all potential sources of vibration reduction systems.  The intended use for the system is to reduce the vibration caused by imbalance of rotating machinery, such as axial flow air propellers and centrifugal flow lift fans, on Naval Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs).  The information provided will assist NSWCCD in understanding the technologies available to perform this function.  The Government is looking for current and available technology in the open market, not new technology in a developmental stage.  This market survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. 

Description
This section provides a set of performance characteristics that meet the needs of a potential demonstration system, although consideration will be given to minor deviations from these requirements.  
The rotating machinery which is subject to imbalance has the following operational characteristics:1.	Maximum rotational speeds between 1000 and 2200 RPM.2.	Absorbed power between 2 and 7 MW (2,600-9,300 SHP).3.	Drive shaft outer diameter between 12 and 45 cm (4.7-17.7 inches).4.	Permissible vibration limits (approximate):	less than 0.65 cm/s for propellers	less than 0.90 cm/s for lift fans 5.	Exposure to the weather and saltwater and sand spray.

Responses
Responses to this market survey should include supporting materials that demonstrate your companys competence, experience, and overall understanding of the requirements that NSWCCD has identified.  The following information is requested (please indicate if the information is an estimate or actual)
1.	Description of the technology2.	Development history and status3.	Applications and history of fielded systems
4.	Installation and integration requirements5.	ROM cost and development schedule for a prototype system6.	ROM cost and lead time for production units7.	US Military applications including points of contact8.	Information regarding Maximum Imbalance Moment that can be addressed, the system response time, and the maximum rotation rate.
NSWCCD requests your responses by 10:00 am (EST), on 2 May 2008. Information should be e-mailed to Mr. Jeffrey Merlino at jeffrey.merlino@navy.mil or mailed to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Attn: Jeffrey Merlino, 1000 Kitty Hawk Ave., Philadelphia, PA  19112 and labeled with the solicitation number and title.  Questions can be submitted electronically to jeffrey.merlino@navy.mil.  Information provided will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  NSWCCD may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.  At no cost to the government, the government may request further clarification of a contractors submission.

<AWARDEE>R. G. Johnson Company, Incorporated
<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awarded a requirement for enhanced protection to the personnel working underground at the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine. This will be partially accomplished through the installation of a tunnel liner with backfill to the mine roof and ribs (walls). This tunnel liner will extend 640 ft into an alternate escapeway from just outside a portal. The tunnel liner will provide permanent support irrespective of future stability issues or developments and will meet the requirements of preserving the facility for future research needs. Enhanced personnel protection from roof falls and the long-term viability of the mine will also be accomplished through the installation of rock and cable bolts and meshing across the mine roof and partially down each rib/pillar (wall) and through the application of shotcrete in other needed sections of both escapeways.</p>

<AWARDEE>VALUE-ADDED COMMUNICATIONS
<DESC>Each year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), undertakes immigration enforcement actions involving hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals.  These actions include the arrest, detention, and removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  These violations include:  losing legal status by failing to abide by the terms and conditions of entry, or by engaging in crimes such as terrorist activity¸ violent crimes, document fraud, and drug smuggling.  Responsibility for the enforcement of immigration laws within the interior United States rests with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Detainees are held at Service Processing Centers (SPCs), Contract Detention Facilities (CDFs), (normally “Primary Detention Facilities”) and State/local government facilities (Inter-Governmental Service Agreement facilities-IGSA) (normally “Secondary Detention Facilities”) located throughout the US and US Territories.
ICE National Detention Standards (NDS) guarantees all detainees free telephone access to ICE identified entities. These ICE identified entities include foreign Embassies, Consulates, Immigration Courts and approved pro bono and community based free immigration legal service providers. The DTS-IV vendor provides this free telephone access at all ICE identified “over 72 hour” Inter-governmental Services Agreement (IGSA) facilities and at ICE Primary locations. The DTS-IV vendor accomplishes this contractual requirement by hosting a “pro-bono network” which allows all ICE detainees access to identified entities. The DTS-IV vendor hosts this pro-bono platform at no cost to ICE or to the detainees. In return, the telephone vendor receives all debit card and collect calling revenue from ICE primary locations. As this is a $0 cost contract, this is the only revenue the telephone vendor receives. Currently, all ICE Primary facilities allow detainees controlled access to the PCS operated telephone system to make both outgoing debit-card, collect and free pro-bono calls.  Only free pro-bono calls are accomplished at ICE Secondary facilities.  None of these sites allow for incoming calls. The DTS supports all current requirements of the ICE Detention Standards – Telephone Access (National Detention Standards of September 2000 or as Amended).  The DTS-V offeror will work closely with the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), and ICE/DRO Agency Technical Representatives (ATR) acting as support staff.
