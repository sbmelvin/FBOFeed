<DESC>Design and Fabrication of 30 Kilowatt Thermal Storage Test Units

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is building a new Thermal Storage Process and Components Integration Laboratory for developing, testing and evaluating novel thermal energy storage materials and systems for Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies (www.nrel.gov/csp/).  The laboratory will be equipped with three test units that supply and withdraw thermal energy from candidate thermal energy storage (TES) systems at a 30 kW power rating.  Thermal energy will be supplied to the TES systems as high-temperature heat transfer fluid (HTF) as in the current parabolic trough power plants or as high-temperature, high-pressure steam.  The 30 kW units are intended to test and evaluate novel TES materials and systems on a laboratory scale before moving to pilot testing or field demonstration.  This world-class testing and evaluation laboratory will provide industry and university participants a capability to validate new storage materials and concepts that will make CSP technologies cost competitive in utility-scale markets.

NREL will soon release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the detailed design, fabrication and installation of the three 30 kW test units.  The RFP will include specifications for each of the three test units along with conditions for their fabrication and installation.  If you are interested in receiving the full set of specifications for the Thermal Storage Test Units in the formal RFP from NREL, please submit your contact information only to the following no later than July 16, 2010:

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Atlanta, GA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Buccaneer Computer Systems and Services Inc. (BSCCI), 6799 Kennedy Rd., Suite J. Warrenton, Va 20187 for acquisition of Medicare records data regarding Sugical Site Infections (SSI) from inpatient, nursing home, and out-patient facilites throughout the nation. No other sources were considered because BCSSI is the only vendor for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Thus, they are the sole entity that has access to medical records based upon CMS data elements. Prior work upon which this study builds was obtained directly from CMS. However, CMS no longer provides data directly to sister federal agencies thus requiring the use of their BCSSI contractor.
<p><br />This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition is to the BSCCI under authority of 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Procurement and Grants Office, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341, Reference 2010-85449. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov. The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.406-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with BSCCI as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. For contractual questions contact Maria Shamburger by email at heg9@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br /><br />Insurers, agencies, and attorneys have significant responsibilities under the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) provisions of the Social Security Act Section 1862(b) [42 U.S.C. 1395y] to protect Medicare's interests. Medicare does not pay for an individual's Workers Compensation-related medical services and/or prescription drugs when the individual receives a Workers Compensation(WC) settlement that includes funds for future medical and/or prescription drug expenses. Therefore, it is highly critical that the individual consider Medicare's interests at the time of settlement. For this reason, CMS recommends that parties to a WC settlement set aside funds, known as a Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-Aside Arrangement or "WCMSA," for all future medical and/or prescription drug expenses related to the WC injury or illness/disease that would otherwise be reimbursable by Medicare. <br /><br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Office of Financial services Group (FSG) is seeking a qualified 8(a) contractor to perform Medicare Set-Aside Arrangement work, acting in the role of the Workers Compensation Review Contractor (WCRC). The WCRC shall, IAW CMS guidelines, and acting as an impartial entity, evaluate WCMSA proposals, and independently project the future medical costs, including prescription drugs, related to the WC injury, illness, or disease, that would be otherwise reimbursable by Medicare. The WCRC shall utilize and work within, the CMS-developed and owned Workers Comp Case Control System (WCCCS), an electronic distributed case and correspondence database system, on a distributed basis from the New York host server; as well as the Redbook prescription pricing tool. The WCRC shall, upon reviewing each complete WCMSA proposal (case), recommend the WCMSA dollar amount for each proposal, and which is subsequently reviewed and approved/rejected by CMS final determination.<br /><br />In addition, the WCRC shall be required to perform outreach, and educational activities, and contribute technical input, and workers compensation technical information to CMS. The WCRC shall track, capture, and report metrics each month.<br /><br />For staffing and other resource considerations, the contractor shall anticipate receiving and completing 1750 to 2500 WCMSA proposals per month. All contractor personnel are subject to background investigation, and must pass a criminal background check. There will be four (4) key positions, for which CMS has right of personnel approval. <br /><br />The contract shall have a 2-3 month transition period. A twelve month base period of performance, and four each twelve-month option periods, each option to be exercised individually at the discretion of the Government.<br />This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal by August 1, 2010. The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded in early March 2011.<br /><br />Points of Contact: <br /><br />Alan Fredericks, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-8622, FAX 410-786-9922, Email alan.fredericks@cms.hhs.gov<br /><br />Mark Werder, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-7839, FAX 410-786-9922, Email mark.werder@cms.hhs.gov<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Office of Acquisition and Grants management, 7500 Security Blvd. C2-21-15, Baltimore, MD. 21244-1850<br />

<DESC>Recovery  This notice is provided for information purposes only.  NASA LaRCintends to issue a cost plus fixed fee contract to Honeywell International entitledRESEARCH IN VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION OF SAFETY-CRITICAL INTEGRATED DISTRIBUTEDSYSTEMS.  The first year of this competitive action will be funded by the AmericanReinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). The option year effort will be funded by other thanARRA.  This award results from a competitive selection under the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration (NASA) Headquarters released NASA Research Announcement (NRA) forfoundational research in support of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD),entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009 under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment7-B.6 Verification and Validation of Flight-Critical Systems (VVFCS1), sub-topicVVFCS-1.2 Integrated Distributed Systems. ARMD conducts research across a breadth of coreaeronautics competencies; research in key areas related to the development of advancedaircraft technologies and systems; and research that supports the Next Generation AirTransportation System (NEXTGen), in partnership with the Joint Planning and DevelopmentOffice (JPDO). The JPDO has identified a lack of validation and verification (V&V)methods needed to certify the safety of complex, NextGen systems as a critical gap. As aJPDO member agency, NASA is targeting this critical gap through the verification andValidation of Flight-Critical Systems (VVFCS) initiative in ARMDs Aviation SafetyProgram.  The Integrated Distributed Systems research area emphasizes the advancement anddevelopment of V&V methods that meet the challenges for future aviation systems that mustoperate as an integrated network of distributed systems. The objective of this researchis to develop a collection of technologies and mathematical models that enable rigorous,comprehensive analysis of functionally integrated distributed systems interacting throughvarious structures such as communications networks and human-automation and human-humaninteraction.  The principal focus is to develop capabilities and supporting evidence toenable defensible, explicit assurance claims concerning safety implications introduced bytechnological advances in distributed aviations systems.  The referenced solicitation is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 andNFS 1835.016.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition basis the following: 1) 4,000 pounds of 200 micron Ammonium Perchlorate in 50-gallon drums on pallets (Quantity - 1 lot).  This requirement is sole sourced to American Pacific Corporation, 3883 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 700, Las Vegas, NV 89169-5995 due to the need to keep materials consistent.  There are subtle differences in a chemical made by one manufacturer compared with another; therefore when ordering raw material for a given propellant, the task becomes replacing the original raw material with the same chemical manufactured in the same way by the same manufacturer.  Since propellants are formulated to give specific properties and compositions, any substitution of a material that is not from the same manufacturer generates a propellant that is somewhat different in these properties and/or compositions than the original. Any firms believing that they can provide the Ammonium Perchlorate as stated above, may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 5 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the data without causing programmatic hardship to the program.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Santa Cruz, CA requires on-going isotopic analysis of Strontium and Neodymium samples taken from the San Francisco Bay Coastal System.  As a result, the USGS intends to award on a sole source basis this order to the Pacific Centre for Isotopic & Geochemical Research (PCIGR), University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.    PCIGR is the only known source who has performed the required analysis using TIMS, MC-ICP-MS, and HR-ICP-MS on samples previously taken from the coastal system.  The necessity to maintain a consistent and comparable result of the analysis has been deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.  Interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS requirement may request a copy of RFQ 10WRQQ0234 by contacting the Contracting Officer at sevans@usgs.gov.  All quotes will be submitted with the vendor's capabilities statement, including work using the analysis methods identified above, and specific results derived from the San Francisco Bay Coastal System to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 2:00 PM PDT.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine vendor capabilities.  All vendors must be active in CCR and ORCA.NAISC: 611310

<p><br />The Feasibility Study (FS) is aimed at assessing the applicability of a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tower system with molten salt storage technology for implementation in Upper Egypt. The Grantee plans to construct a 250-MW CSP plant that is expected to catalyze the development of other CSP projects in Egypt and contribute to Egypt's renewable energy targets, while servicing the expected surge in future demand of electricity from new specialized industrial zones (estimated to be 2,500 MW over the next five years). The development of Upper Egypt is a priority for the Government of Egypt. This project will help to ensure the availability of clean and renewable electricity in the region. The study will rely in part on commitments by the Grantee to provide information and data collection, and an in-kind cost share that will consist of the installation of three solar irradiation measurement devices for use in completing the feasibility study.</p>
<p>The goal of the TAQA CSP Plant is to develop, construct, operate and maintain a 250-MW CSP plant as a renewable energy solution in an area of Egypt where electricity demand is expected to increase significantly. The Grantee requires an FS to determine the economic viability of CSP technology in Egypt. Specifically, the FS will evaluate the viability of using a CSP tower system with molten salt storage technology, as well as alternative CSP technologies. Upon successful implementation of the TAQA CSP plant, the Grantee plans to develop three additional CSP plants in two implementation phases, with a total capacity of 1,000 MW. They are to be connected to the Egyptian grid and operated under a proposed feed-in tariff regime. Total implementation cost of the project is $1.23 billion with an estimated $478 million in potential U.S. exports.</p>
<p>The FS will provide the Grantee a bankable study that gives financial justification for implementing a CSP plant project in Egypt. Lacking demonstrated commercial viability of CSP technology, and in particular without knowing the true construction, operation and maintenance costs of a CSP plant in Egypt, TAQA Arabia remains unable to build and put into operation a CSP plant. Implementation of this project will help achieve the expressed Egyptian goal of increasing the use of clean and renewable sources of energy. Key aspects of the FS will include the determination of costs of local labor and materials sourced in Egypt; an analysis of unique financial structuring aspects such as sovereign guarantees, accelerated depreciation, carbon financing, and feed-in tariff rates; selection of the most appropriate CSP technology for Egypt; and quantification of the social and local economic benefits of CSP for Egypt.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $603,790 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

The major components for these radar systems are the Operations Control Group, Antenna Transceiver Group (ATG), and Generator Power Group. The AN/TPQ-36(V) is a mobile, phased-array radar system that automatically covers short-range mortar and artillery fire, while the AN/TPQ-37(V) covers long-range artillery fire. The AN/TPQ-46(V) is the Marine Corps version of the FIREFINDER Radar System. These radar systems provide required force protection to Warfighters conducting tactical missions associated with multiple worldwide operations. These systems are currently operating 24/7 in Southwest Asia to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and the Global War on Terror. The Governments requirements include, but are not limited to the following: 1) Various National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified on two separate NSN Lists to be supplied upon receipt of a written inquiry, 2) Procurement of various system components (i.e. ATG, and newly redesigned Radar Processors), 3) Depot Level Maintenance Support Services such as: repairs of Secondary Items, system level repairs based on contingency requirements, 4) improvement efforts to eliminate or reduce parts obsolescence, increase reliability and maintainability to support optimum availability of these radar systems and their components, 5) life extension initiatives and implementation of technology refreshment/insertion to sustain the life expectancy of these radar systems, 6) technical engineering and support services for all fielded FIREFINDER Radar Systems within the Continental United States and Outside the Continental United States.

The vision of the SPS-MSCD Program is to develop and demonstrate materials and material systems that can be engineered to efficiently manipulate the threat energy spatially and temporally, thereby spreading, capturing, and converting early time threat energy to maximize the rate of energy degradation and counteract penetration or blast. This effort is the exploratory phase of a larger program to establish feasibility and lay the groundwork for subsequent development that may not be covered by the anticipated BAA. This anticipated solicitation will be specifically for innovative multidisciplinary research proposals to develop and demonstrate technologies that will: <br />&bull; change the way armor solutions are developed by taking a more fundamental approach to the response of materials subjected to high rate dynamic loading; and<br />&bull; enable the defeat of the suite of current and envisioned future ballistic (bullets, fragments and EFPs) and blast threats, with performance increases substantially better than Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) steel and at lower weights.<br /><br />See Attached Special Notice DARPA-SN-10-59.

(See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B).)...</p>
<p>5. Reason Authority Cited:</p>
<p>The Iowa National Guard determined that the mechanical system in the Communications Facility needed to be modified from the proposed upgrades in the existing system to a geothermal system to increase the energy efficiency of the facility. The original plans and specifications required the modification and alteration of the interior of the facility along with upgrading the existing mechanical systems. The proposed change to a geothermal system will require work that was previously outlined in the plans and specifications to be deleted from the original scope of work; in addition, to adding new work to accommodate the geothermal system. The undersigned has concluded that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the original offeror due to the work being deleted from the original plans and specifications and the addition of the new work. Using a third party would result in significant challenges and possible duplication in efforts trying to coordinate work being deleted from the original contract and the new work required for the geothermal system by the third party. Therefore, the undersigned believes it is in the government best interest to restrict competition on this change order.</p>
<p>6. Actions to Increase Competition:</p>
<p>The Government will request the General contractor to promote competition to the maximum extent possible amongst their subcontractor and suppliers. However, based on the fact the items will be deleted from the original scope of work the possibility of competition amongst the subcontractors and suppliers will be limited.</p>
<p>7. Market Research:</p>
<p>Market research was not conducted because the Government is deleting work from the original scope of work. Having two separate contracts would result in duplication in efforts and possible additional cost to the Government for conflicts between the two contracts (if two separate contracts were awarded).</p>
<p>8. Other Interested Sources:</p>
<p>No other source has expressed an interest at this time; however, other sources may include the mechanical and electrical subcontractors in the Fort Dodge area.</p>
<p>9. Subsequent Acquisitions:</p>
<p>This is an isolated situation and the undersigned does not anticipate this type of change order on future construction project.</p>
<p>10. Procurement History:</p>
<p>Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number: W912LP-09-C-0002<br />Previously Competed? Yes<br />Previous authority for less than Full and Open Competition: Not Applicable<br /><br />11. Certification: I certify that the information included in this mini-J&amp;A is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is requesting information from industry on the future of the current Defense Base Act (DBA) Insurance Program ID/IQ Contract with USACE.  Under the current USACE contract, all USACE contracts and subcontracts involving overseas performance are required by law to provide overseas employees with insurance coverage pursuant to the Longshoremens and Harbor Workers Compensation Act/Defense Base Act or DBA.  The current program is centrally managed by a single insurance company and its broker unless a waiver has been obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor.  The current contractor deals directly with the  contractors requiring DBA insurance for payment arrangements and resolution of issues.  Reimbursement of DBA insurance is made under the appropriate contract.<BR><BR>USACE is canvassing industry to gain assured availability and affordability of coverage.  USACE has come to realize that the market may have changed as the insurance carriers have gained more knowledge of the risks associated with being in the war zones and as knowledge of the requirement for DBA Insurance has improved.  At its inception, the centrally managed program appears to have resulted in lower premiums than the open market, especially for the small business concerns.  DOD-wide DBA premium information for FY 2009 reveals that the open market rates are lower than the USACE single-provider contract rates, computed on a weighted average basis.  However, USACE has concerns that open market rates for DBA Insurance may not be conducive for small businesses.  Additionally, the current single-provider program does not require a minimum premium.<BR><BR>USACE would like to ask Industry to respond to this request for information by answering the following:<BR><BR>a.  A brief statement as to thoughts of USACE getting out of the insurance business.  Is it a good idea to continue a Centrally-Managed Program with a single source provider?<BR>b.  Are carriers still charging minimum premiums in the current market?  If so, how much are they charging?<BR>c.  How would your rates be affected by small businesses that perform overseas?<BR>d.  Would industry be interested in competing should USACE decide to issue another solicitation for a single source provider of DBA Insurance? <BR>e.  Would industry (contractors requiring DBA insurance) have interest in participating in the single-provider program if participation were optional?<BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Susan Stewart, either via email at susan.m.stewart@usace.army.mil or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA), Contracting Office, ATTN:  Susan M. Stewart, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA  22315.  Responses must be received not later than 1400 hrs, local time on 16 July 2010. <BR>

Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, VISN 19, 4100 East Mississippi Ave, Glendale, CO 80246

2.  Nature/description of action.

This activity proposes to solicit sole source with Carepoint Health Care to provide nursing assistance for the Patient-Centered Disease Management TeleHealth study at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

To provide a research nurse to support the Patient-Centered Disease Management intervention study director by Dr. John Rumsfeld.

The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center
1055 Clermont Street
 Denver, CO 80220
Quote: 
Estimated Price = $12,500 ($51/hr)

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

Patient-Centered Disease Management (PCDM) is a care intervention study within the REAP at the Denver VAMC.  The care intervention requires a research nurse at the baseline and follow-up visit.  The intervention involves the use of the Health Buddy (telehealth) and the study is coordinated through a database. Therefore, this study requires a nurse with experience in patient care intervention, is trained in telehealth, and has extensive computer/database skills. Maria Arellano of Carepoint Health Care is a nurse who has the experience of working on another REAP patient-based care intervention study using telehealth. Furthermore, Maria has a Master's degree in health information technology.   The PCDM study requires a very specific skill set (nursing, telehealth training and health information technology) that only a person of Maria's experience and training can fulfill.  

6.  Description of Efforts to Ensure Soliciting  of as Many Sources as Possible.

This acquisition will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site as a sole-source procurement. Questions concerning this procurement's qualification as a sole-source procurement can be raised by the public at that time. 

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.

The rate of $51/hr is considered a fair and reasonable cost for the proposed services rendered based on similar positions at the VA (see below).  

8.  Description of Market Survey.

The telehealth nurse salary was used as a guide. The hourly rate was based on a Grade 2 step 12 RN. This is a step below other  telehealth nurses because Maria is new to the VA system. The $51 rate is the equivalent contract rate since no benefits are provided with contractors. 

9.  Any Other Supporting Data.

There are no other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 
        
10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

Carepoint Health Care Consulting, LLC
1621 Pickett Ct.
Erie, CO  80516-7532

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

As this is not a recurring acquisition, there are no actions that may be taken to overcome barriers to acquisition.

The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the Wastewater collection system privatization are:<br />&bull; Grease Traps<br />&bull; Oil-Water Separators<br />&bull; Septic Systems<br />&bull; Leach Fields<br />&bull; Pretreatment Systems<br />Dobbins Air Reserve Base has a sewage collection system that serves the majority of the site. The Wastewater collection system is operated and maintained by Dobbins ARB, and includes areas of the base that are occupied by various Reserve Units, including the Army and Georgia Army National Guard. Dobbins ARB does not maintain the Wastewater collection system associated with areas currently occupied by Lockheed Martin. <br />The majority of wastewater generated at Dobbins ARB is delivered to the sewage treatment plant, AF Plant No. 6, located on the southwestern side of the base. Lockheed Martin leases and operates AF Plant No. 6; Dobbins ARB does not operate or maintain the sewage treatment plant. Remote areas of the Base are served by septic tank systems which are isolated from the wastewater collection system. Wastewater from U.S. Army Reserve facilities discharges directly into a collector line of the Cobb County sanitary sewer system that traverses the edge of the base. <br />The installation's wastewater collection system is government owned and operated, and consists mostly of original vitrified clay pipes ranging in size from 4 to 10 inches in diameter, with later expansions consisting mainly of concrete pipe, ductile iron, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. The average depth of the collection system in 8' with ranges from 6' to 12', and an estimated 10% of piping is buried beneath 6" asphalt. Sewage is transported to the treatment plant via a network of six lift stations aligned along the collection system. The recent upgrades to the system have been those associated with the construction of new buildings or replacement of collection lines, in which case polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping was used in place of vitrified clay or concrete piping.<br />Lockheed Martin does not meter the total volume of wastewater. Rather, the base is billed for sanitary sewer services based on total water consumption during the same period. This method is based on an assumption that 75 percent of the base's potable water consumption will re-enter the system as wastewater.

<SOLNBR>FA8675-10-R-0011
<ARCHDATE>01012010
<CONTACT>Herbert B. Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-883-0180, Fax 850-883-0543, Email Herbert.Hill@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Control Section Modification (HCSM) limited production units and the full rate production (FRP) Lot 1 and Lot 2 options. The 693rd Armament Systems Squadron (693 ARSS), 328th Armament Systems Group (328 ARSG), 308th Armament Systems Wing (308 ARSW), Eglin AFB, FL plans to award two sole source limited production contracts. The limited production contracts call for the contractors to produce modified HARM control sections that: (a) add a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance capability, (b) increase the current control section Inertial Navigation Set (INS) accuracy, and (c) restructure the current AGM-88C seeker software to migrate the guidance function from the seeker to the control section. The modified control sections must meet the requirements of Weapon System Specification 2261672, dated September 18, 2006; Missile Prime Item Development Specification 2261673, dated September 18, 2006; and the Control Section Prime Item Development Specification 2261674, dated September 18, 2006, while maintaining the missile interface as defined by AS-5186C, dated April 8, 2003, and AS5108D-C, dated August 10, 2001. The HARM with a modified control section will be employed on the F-16 Block 50/52 aircraft utilizing the current LAU-118 launcher, which includes the Aircraft Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC). No modifications to the aircraft or ALIC hardware and software will be allowed. The contractors will be required to utilize existing Field Level Support Equipment without modification. Under the limited production contracts, the contractors will be required to deliver two engineering evaluation units (one 6 months after award and the other 10 months after award) and five modified HARM control sections for performance verification (12 months after award) and the test support and data analysis during the six-month performance verification period. The limited-production contracts also contain options for two production lots, with not-to-exceed pricing for a quantity range of control sections, warranty and special tooling and test equipment. <br />
<p><br />The Government anticipates awarding the FRP options based on a limited competition between the two contractors utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection procedures after performance verification is complete. The total number of modified HARM control sections the Government will purchase under the two FRP lots is approximately 500. The Government's intent is to purchase as many as the budget allows. Inasmuch as Raytheon and Alliant Techsystems, Inc (ATK) are currently performing work on the HARM, the Government will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment to any prospective new source. Therefore, the fulfillment of the supplies listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture. Anticipated date of the RFP for limited production is on or about 15 Dec 09; date of closing response is on or about 15 Feb 10.</p>
<p>This acquisition is contemplated under the authority of Title 10, United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources." The limited production contracts will be awarded on a sole source basis and the full rate production options will be awarded on a limited competition basis. The sole source awards are to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems, 9000 S. Rita Road, Bldg 9022, M/S R117, Tucson, AZ 85744 and ATK Mission Systems, Advanced Weapons, 21301 Burbank Blvd, Woodland Hills, CA 91367. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the 693 ARSS.</p>
<p>The date for response to this synopsis for HARM Control Section Modification is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication. Facsimile responses or requests to the Contracting Officer at (850) 883-0543 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt. Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Ms Corletta (Nicky) Wilson, Contract Specialist, (850) 883-0309 or Mr Herbert (Bo) Hill, (850) 883-0180, 693 ARSS/SYKA, 207 West D Ave, Suite 622, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6844.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR>Technical Capability________________________<BR><BR>Past Performance_________________________<BR><BR>Price___________________________________<BR><BR>Technical and past performance, when combined, is approximately equal to cost or price.<BR>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	a.   The proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following factors:<BR><BR>Factor 1: Technical Approach<BR>Factor 2: Past Performance<BR>Factor 3: Price<BR><BR>	b.   Relative Importance of Factors.  The relative importance of each factor is as follows:  Factor 1 is more important than Factor 2.

FACTOR 1 - Technical Approach- The Offeror shall demonstrate understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Objectives and produce a Statement of Work that will meet those objectives.  The proposal will be evaluated based on the proposed approach to perform the work.<BR><BR>Sub-Factor A. Narrative of work to be performed. This shall not be a restatement of the statement of a work but will be the process the offeror is proposing to perform the work to show understanding of the processes involved. <BR><BR>      Sub-Factor B. Proposed Material Identification  The government will evaluate and consider materials and equipment proposed by brand name and model number as quality standard.  The proposer shall include in the proposal material identification for major materials for all proposed materials to be installed.<BR>.<BR><BR><BR>    d. FACTOR 2 - Past Performance.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the solicitations requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance.  <BR><BR>	(1).   Recency Assessment.  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past 3 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.<BR><BR>            (2). Relevancy Assessment.  The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services/products being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offerors (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  The past performance information provided in the proposal and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance. Offerors shall provide a point of contact for each record provided.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a  Neutral rating for the Past Performance factor.  <BR><BR>        .  <BR><BR>e. Factor 3 Price analysis will be used to determine that the prices are fair, reasonable, and realistic in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.

Fair probability of success with low to moderate degree of risk. <BR>Marginal	A proposal that satisfies most but not all of the Governments requirements and fails to provide sufficient detail to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.  The proposal contains numerous weaknesses (to include significant weaknesses) and/or some deficiencies, but the overall approach is sufficiently sound that the weaknesses and/or deficiencies may be corrected without a major rewrite of the proposal.  The degree of proposal risk is moderate to high. <BR>Unacceptable	Significantly fails to meet minimum PWS requirements necessary for acceptable performance.  The overall proposal contains numerous weaknesses/significant weaknesses and deficiencies that cannot be corrected through discussions, without a major rewrite of the proposal.  The degree of  proposal risk is high to very high.<BR><BR><BR>	<BR><BR>	b.  Factor 2; The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below.

Performance Risk Level:  Unknown <BR>	<BR>	<BR><BR>4 - Definitions:<BR><BR>a.   Deficiency.  A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.<BR><BR>b.  Strength.  Any aspect of a proposal when judged against a stated evaluation criterion, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.<BR><BR>c.  Significant Strength.  A significant strength appreciably enhances the merit of a proposal or appreciably increases the probability of successful contract performance.<BR><BR>d.  Weakness.  A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contact performance.<BR><BR>e.  Significant Weakness.  A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<BR><BR>(b) Options.

<ARCHDATE>01032011
<CONTACT>Drew Dean , Email DARPA-BAA-10-81@darpa.mil
<DESC>FULL ANNOUNCEMENT IS ATTACHED<br /><br />
<p>The goal of the PROCEED research effort is to develop practical methods for computation on encrypted data without decrypting the data and to develop modern programming languages to describe these computations. PROCEED is a comprehensive research effort with six primary research thrusts:</p>
<p>&bull; Mathematical Foundations of Fully Homomorphic Encryption - Discovery and development of new mathematical underpinnings for efficient computation on encrypted data is needed in a noninteractive setting. The solution might involve fully homomorphic encryption [Gentry09, Gentry10, Smart10] that allow noninteractive computation on encrypted data. This area is captured in RA-10-80, and interested proposers are referred to that solicitation.</p>
<p>&bull; Mathematical Foundations of Secure Multiparty Computation - Discovery and development of new mathematical underpinnings for efficient computation on encrypted data is needed in an interactive setting. Secure multiparty computation [Yao86, Bickson10] has a rich history of interactive computation on encrypted data, but requires further improvements to be truly practical.</p>
<p>&bull; Mathematical Foundations of Supporting Security Technologies - Computation on encrypted data preserves the confidentiality of the data being computed on, but does not inherently protect the integrity of the computation, nor provide strong protection of the program, among other potentially desirable security goals. Techniques to address these and other related security issues are sought in the PROCEED research effort.</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation/Measurement/Optimization - To make computation on encrypted data practical, highly optimized implementations, possibly including programmable hardware, will be needed. Experience shows there can be at least an order of magnitude difference in the performance of highly optimized cryptography implementations over less sophisticated implementations.</p>
<p>&bull; Algorithms - Practical computation on encrypted data will require libraries of data structures and algorithms that are optimized for efficiency in the encrypted domain. Most current approaches to computation on encrypted data work by turning a program (with a bounded maximum input size) into a circuit. An important goal for optimization is minimizing circuit depth, which is traditionally a goal of hardware designers, not programmers.</p>
<p>&bull; Programming Languages - More advanced languages are sought, with type systems that embed cryptographic knowledge, making programming computation on encrypted data no more difficult than conventional programming. Today's languages for computation on encrypted data, such as the one in the FairPlay system [Malkhi04] are simple, imperative languages that have little, if any, type system support for cryptography.</p>
<p>PROCEED will have a research integrator role to define a common cryptographic application programming interface (API), ensuring the compilers and cryptography implementations are interoperable and to support the Government's evaluation team.<br /><br />FULL ANNOUNCEMENT IS ATTACHED</p>

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.<br />EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
<p>1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.<br />2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)<br />3.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Risk Reduction Division (RRD) of FEMA's Mitigation Directorate requires Programmatic Technical Assistance (PTA) in applying and maintaining FEMA's Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) Tool . State, Local and Tribal Governments frequently request grants to assist in mitigating loss of life and property due to natural and manmade disasters. The FEMA BCA Tool was developed to establish a consistent, uniform automated tool developed to assess the benefits flowing from the proposed grant relative to the cost of the grant. The contractor would also be required to maintain BCA Tool, enhance it as required and to teach the application of the tool to key stakeholders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally, RRD is seeking the development and implementation of a Loss Avoidance National Tool (LANT). A LANT will assess effectiveness of previously issued grants by capturing the avoidance of life and property loss due to grant implementation. Such analyses are not new; however, a uniform, automated approach is required to reduce analysts' effort and to provide a consistent methodology. The Contractor would also be responsible for training development and instruction for key stakeholders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technical communication of the tool, its application and installation is part of the requirement.</span></p>

Further, the Contractor would provide assistance to improve the quality of RRD technical reports. The Contractor would also provide expert advice on loss avoidance, benefit-cost analysis and other mitigation projects on an as needed basis. There is a requirement that the Contractor provide expert support and advice on programmatic information analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This analysis will include quantitative and qualitative analyses and will utilize Geographical Information System (GIS) and spatial analysis related tools.</span></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-43.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332999 for 100% small business set-aside. The associated small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for laboratory animal caging. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order for, brand-name or equal as a result of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation that will include the terms and conditions that are set forth herein.</p>
<p>Background<br />In collaboration with the NIAID IAA 2646, the NHDP maintains a colony of nine-banded armadillos as a basic resource in support of leprosy research. Armadillos are exotic laboratory animals and require adaptation of normal laboratory animal regimen. Standard plastic floored rabbit caging units, Model RB272718UP6 as manufactured by Allentown Caging and Equipment have been adapted for housing nine-banded armadillos. The armadillo is a mammal of similar size to laboratory rabbits but also has strong front and rear legs with long sharp claws and soft foot pads. These adapted caging units provide approximately 5 square feet of floor space per cage. Previous studies have shown that ganging cages within racks provides an enriched environment which necessitates less frequent cleaning. The connecting tunnels connect the cages when used for housing and breeding laboratory rabbits and are suitable for access by armadillos.</p>
<p>The National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP) Laboratory Research Branch requires the following:</p>

6.  Research Opportunity Description
Within DHS, multiple agencies have operational needs that require them to quickly and easily establish portable high throughput security checkpoints.  In order to execute this mission, DHS S&T is in need of an improved Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) that can be used for the portable detection of metallic and nonmetallic anomalies on individual personnel with the assistance of Automated Threat Recognition (ATR). Metal detection requirements shall be no less than the current capabilities of the Enhanced Metal Detection (EMD) systems currently being deployed by DHS component agencies. EMD for this purpose is defined as a walk-through sensor for specifically detecting metal objects concealed anywhere on the body, in any orientation, and at any walking or standing position through a gateway.  The ability of the AIT system to detect nonmetallic objects shall be no less than the capabilities of the AIT systems currently certified by the Transportation Security Lab (TSL), while adhering to the additional requirements set forth in this BAA.
The imager must be portable in that it can easily be transported and assembled at various indoor/outdoor operational locations for use; therefore, the storage/transport cases must be able to fit through standard doors and in standard elevators.  The system should be easily deployed with minimal personnel, optimally one person but no more than two.  Other size requirements include, but are not limited to, the weight of boxes and the footprint of the technology.  The persons being screened will be divested of outer jackets and have all extraneous objects removed from their pockets; failure to comply may result in a positive detection and a secondary search by the operators.  During screening, the persons may be asked to stretch their arms out to the side; however, no turning of the subject is permitted during the scan.  The scan should cover the entire person to include footwear and headwear.  The desired throughput of the imaging system is at least 4 people per minute including entry and exit of portal, scan, analysis, and results.  The resulting image display and data retention options must allow for various levels of privacy protection and personal information safeguards.  Imagery displays are to depict nonhuman images (i.e. "stick" figures), and the ATR alerts will prevent the requirement for any operator interpretation.  Operators will only facilitate the screening process based on the ATR's detection of anomalies.  The control and display interfaces must be available locally to the operator with an option for remote monitoring.  In order to be operated in public and private venues, the imaging system must meet all required safety standards and system certifications.  
"	Detailed requirements list is provided in Appendix B of this solicitation.
For the quantification of technology readiness, DHS S&T employs a framework for Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment. This framework is summarized in Appendix A and covers hardware design, software development, and system integration. In this BAA, DHS S&T is not interested in technologies in a basic research phase (e.g., TRLs 1, 2, and 3); DHS S&T is interested in technologies already at TRL 4-5 that will be capable of reaching TRL 6-7 prototype in less than 32 months.

9. Proprietary Protection
All submissions will be considered source selection sensitive and protected accordingly. Documents may only be reviewed by the Offeror, authorized Government representatives, and assigned evaluators. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information.
10.  Organizational Conflict of Interest 
Organizational Conflict of Interest issues will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as outlined below. Offerors who have existing contract(s) to provide scientific, engineering, technical and/or administrative support directly to the DHS S&T Directorate will receive particular scrutiny. 
(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more Offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. 
(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the Offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offeror and include the appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the Offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated, or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the Offeror may be found ineligible for award. 
(c) Disclosure: The Offeror must represent, as part of its proposal and to the best of its knowledge that: (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract; or (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included the mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision. 
(d) Mitigation/Waiver. If an Offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes it can be mitigated, neutralized, or avoided, the Offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Contracting Officer for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. 
(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the Offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the Offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the Offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. 
(f) Corporation Change. The successful Offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision. 
(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. 
11.  International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
Export Control Considerations
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) may apply to one or more of the topicsin this BAA. Foreign nationals must meet the requirements for participation set by thoseregulations, if required.
II. AWARD INFORMATION
1.  Total Amount of Funding
Although subject to official fiscal appropriation, it is anticipated that the DHS Portable AIT Program will have no more than 4 awards for this first phase with no vendor receiving more than $500,000 for the execution of Phase I.  
Phase II funding will be determined by the necessary funds required to mature the current TRL 4-5 technology to a TRL 6-7 prototype suitable for independent government testing and evaluation.  
2. Anticipated Number of Awards
As stated above DHS S&T expects that there will be no more than 4 awards for Phase I.  The number of Phase II awards will be dependent on the results of Phase I awards.  DHS S&T reserves the right to fund none, parts, or all of the proposals received and may fund awards by phases/optional tasks under this BAA.



3. Anticipated Contract Types
The government anticipates funding the multiple awards with a combination of contract types such as firm-fixed-price and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Offeror may propose the contract type; proposal costing will be evaluated based on reasonableness. Contract types may differ between Phase I and Phase II, and among Awardees.
4.  Expected Phase Approach 
The Portable AIT Program is intended to be a multi-year effort comprised of two phases: 
Phase I is to determine the system's feasibility by conducting a six (6) month vendor design phase culminating with a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  "	Phase I o	Vendor design phase with PDR (6 months)-  The vendor is to conduct a initial design phase leading to a PDR.  The PDR shall demonstrate the potential utility of their technology to meet the performance requirements established in Appendix B.  In addition the vendor must provide estimates of portability and detection figures for the AIT with ATR.
Phase II will be a two task phase.  The first task will be six (6) months in duration and lead to a Critical Design Review building upon the results of the PDR.  The second task will be a prototype fabrication task that is to be less than or equal to 20 months.  Phase II will conclude with acceptance testing of the Portable AIT with ATR at the contractor site.  "	Phase IIo	Task 1 (6 Months):  Critical Design Review- After a 6 month design phase, the vendors will provide a CDR to the government to determine the progress and eventual utility of the Portable AIT with ATR prototype technology.  If appropriate the vendor will begin prototype component fabrication.  o	Task 2 (less than or equal to 20 Months):  Prototype Fabrication- Remaining engineering will be completed, software will attain full functionality, the TRL 6-7 Portable AIT with ATR prototype will be fabricated  so that the contractor and the government can perform acceptance testing at the contractor site.  During the acceptance testing the system will be tested against the performance requirements outlined in Appendix B.  The contractor will also provide the government with the prototype's maintenance and user manual along with sufficient training in using the technology.   After successful acceptance testing of the TRL 6-7 prototype an independent government test and evaluation will be conducted of the technology at a government testing facility to be determined.

Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model.  The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature.  If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included. The Offerors shall acknowledge that NIST will not store the equipment onsite before it is installed.

Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.

Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein.  The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein.  The quotation should include one of the following statements:

The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition.

If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offerors FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.  

Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT:

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(i)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT(ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE (S) AND FOB TERMS(iii) PRICE
Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.
Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE (S) AND FOB TERMS, is slightly more important than Factor (iii), PRICE.  
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is shown in DELIVERY INFORMATION SECTION.  FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price.
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of clause)

52.252-6     AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES (APR 1984)

(b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any DEVIATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the name of the regulation.
(End of clause)

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.This solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10631 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-41.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380 - Testing Laboratories, which has a size standard of $12.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from award of this solicitation.  The procurement is for analysis of up to 860 marine sediment samples and up to 350 wetland sediment samples for radiochemical analysis (as described below).  The period of performance of this contract shall be 12 months from the date of contract award.  Statement of Work: BACKGROUND: Abundances of naturally occurring, elemental radioisotopes in marine sediments and wetland soils can be used to date sediment or soil deposition in timeframes from days to 100s of years. Radioisotopes frequently used are 234Th (T1/2 = 24.5 d), 7Be (53 d), 137Cs (30 yr) and 210Pb (22.3 yr). Concentrations of these radioisotopes determined in sediment or soil core fractions with depth provide information about deposition rates and mixing. These parameters can be coupled with other measurements to obtain estimates of, for example, organic mater decomposition, organic matter burial, and sediment accretion rates. The US EPA Gulf Ecology Division is conducting research into factors controlling the development of hypoxia (i.e., water where dissolved oxygen concentrations fall below 2.0 mg/L) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Sediment deposition, sediment mixing, and organic matter decomposition rates are all important variables that affect the consumption of oxygen in marine sediments which contributes to the development, extent and duration of Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. Concentrations of 7Be, 234Th, 137Cs, and 210Pb in Gulf of Mexico marine sediment samples are therefore key measurements critical to the success of this research. In addition, the US EPA Gulf Ecology Division is investigating the ecosystem functions and services supported by coastal wetlands in Tampa Bay, Florida. Wetland soil accretion rates are important for quantifying carbon sequestration and ecosystem response to rising sea levels in coastal wetlands. Concentrations of 137Cs and 210Pb in wetland sediment samples are key measurements critical to the success of the US EPA Gulf Ecology Division research in Tampa Bay coastal wetlands.  SCOPE: The contractor shall analyze a minimum of 390 and a maximum of 860 Gulf of Mexico marine sediment samples for 7Be, 234Th, 137Cs, and 210Pb activity and a minimum of 130 and a maximum of 350 wetland sediment samples for 137Cs and 210Pb activity. TASK DESCRIPTION: Analyses of marine sediments shall follow established procedures equivalent to those described by Allison et al. 2005 and Osterman et al. 2009. Marine samples will be collected during a research cruise that will occur between early July 2010 and late October 2010. Marine samples will be shipped to the contractor within two weeks of collection. Marine samples will consist of approximately 70 g (at a maximum for some samples) to 250 g wet sediment. Results of similar analyses for Gulf of Mexico sediments indicate activities might be as low as 0.5 dpm/g sediment (e.g., Allison et al. 2005). Analyses of wetlands sediments shall follow established procedures equivalent to those described by Graham et al. 2005. Wetland samples will be collected between April 2010 and December 2010 and shipped to the contractor within six weeks of collection. Results of similar analyses for Tampa Bay coastal wetland soils indicate activities might be as low as 0.1 dpm/g sediment (e.g., Nawrocki 2001). The contractor shall be responsible for necessary sample preparation and analysis. MILESTONES AND DELIVERABLES: Results shall be reported as the activities (dpm/g) of 7Be, 234Th, 137Cs, and 210Pb in each marine sediment sample. These results shall include activities of supported and excess 234Th and 210Pb.  Wetland results shall be reported as the activities (dpm/g) of 137Cs and 210Pb in each soil sample. These results shall include activities of supported and excess 210Pb. The results shall be provided electronically (Microsoft Excel email attachment or CD) in a form that can be easily copied into other computer applications. The contractor shall provide quality assurance information with each data report sent to the EPA within each 60 days after receipt of each batch of samples. The contractor shall also provide a final hard-copy output of data files (i.e., spreadsheets) for the purpose of quality assurance. A written report detailing the methods used and the results of QA measures shall also be provided by the contractor. Laboratory notes discussing problems encountered shall be included as an appendix to this report. Original records, such as laboratory notebooks and efficiency/calibration curves, shall be retained for at least three years following final report submission, as copies may be requested to be sent to the EPA.  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  The basic minimum criteria include the following quality control samples for a minimum of every 20 samples analyzed: (i) one laboratory method blank, (ii) one duplicate sample analysis, (iii) laboratory control reference materials (equivalent to a certified reference material), and (iv) efficiency/calibration curve(s). Analytical precision for standards shall be ? 2% and error between duplicate samples shall not exceed 20%. The contractor shall re analyze (at no cost to the Government) an entire batch of samples if results of the blanks or standards are deemed unacceptable for the methods utilized. The contractor shall permit QA audit of laboratory and/or data entry procedures by EPA at any time while conducting the analyses (given advance notification). Analyses shall be conducted on a high purity germanium detector or equivalent. For the wetland samples, the 137Cs detection limit should be between 0.02 to 0.1 pCi/g and the 210Pb detection limit should  be approximately 0.5 pCi/g.  APPLICABLE AND CONTROLLING DOCUMENTS: The contractor shall provide a written QA Management Plan equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans (QA/R-2)] and a written Quality Assurance Project Plan equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for QA Project Plans (QA/R-5)] for the Project Officer?s review and approval prior to the analysis of samples. These reference documents can be located at http://www.epa.gov/quality/qa_docs.html.  The QAPP shall describe in detail all chemical methods, including expected recovery of all analytes, and all standard operating procedures used in these analyses. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance shall be 12 months from the date of contract award.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) seeks to meet the President's Open Government Initiative (OGI) to provide increased transparency of Government operations and information by making more patent and trademark bulk data in machine-readable format available to the public via the Internet.
<p>The USPTO OCIO seeks an interested party (henceforth referred to as Contractor) capable of acquiring patent and trademark bulk data and providing such data to the public at no cost to the USPTO or the public.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall consider other formats such as PDF, OpenDoc, etc. and shall provide justification to the USPTO for chosen formats. The Contractor shall define XML Schemas, Style sheets, data dictionary, containers, components and all artifacts necessary to define the data sets used for the purposes of dissemination. The Contractor shall provide all pertinent information/documentation necessary to fully define the format of the data sets for any and all infrastructure developed and delivered by the Contractor. For infrastructure located at the USPTO campus, the Contractor shall devise a plan to reduce the footprint of stored and transmitted data sets for easy transmission over the limited data pipes owned by the USPTO. The Contractor may, at their discretion, add additional data pipes to the USPTO arsenal at no cost to the USPTO to meet the data delivery requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall build and provide two (2) categories of infrastructure to reside at a minimum of two (2) locations as described below:</p>
<p>&bull; Description of Infrastructure to reside at USPTO campus (Collector)</p>
<p>o Such Infrastructure shall extract, collate, format, compress, and otherwise collect patent and trademark bulk data from legacy systems for storage at the USPTO campus for the eventual purpose of dissemination -- thus separating such data from the data sets used for the purpose of examination.<br />o Infrastructure shall include hardware, software and any other necessary components.<br />o Data sets collected by this infrastructure shall be provided to one or more external infrastructure(s) (located outside of the USPTO campus) for actual dissemination to the public.</p>
<p>&bull; Description of Infrastructure to reside outside of USPTO campus (Distributor)</p>
<p>o Infrastructure shall disseminate patent and trademark bulk data to the public, at no cost to the USPTO or public. Data sets shall be received from the infrastructure located at the USPTO campus.<br />o Infrastructure may reside at a single location or may be distributed across several locations based on the architecture designated by the Contractor and approved by the USPTO. External infrastructure used to disseminate data to the public shall not reside at the USPTO campus.</p>
<p>Ninety Percent ("90%") of original source data for this contract resides within Public PAIR content; 10% covers the distribution of existing USPTO patent and trademark bulk data products. Section C.3 (Scope of Work) lists data sets covered by this contract.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-200160 is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42. <br /><br />It is anticipated that a sole source Firm-Fixed Price purchase order shall be awarded as a result of this synopsis/solicitation.

Business concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.<br /><br />Please read and comply with all requirements for submitting a quote. Failure to comply with all instructions contained within this combined synopsis/solicitation could result in the quote being ineligible for award.

The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></span><br /><br />Offerors that have obtained a pass rating on the technical criteria listed above will then be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1. Price<br />2. Delivery<br />3. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)</p>
<p>Price is the most important evaluation factor, with Delivery being the second most important evaluation factor. Price and Delivery, when combined, are more important than Past Performance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span></strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for requirements listed in this solicitation. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. <strong>All offerors must comply with the requirements in section (b) of FAR 52-215-20 found below.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Delivery:</strong></span></p>
<p>The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information IAW the requirements in this solicitation. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span></strong></p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 17 August 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST.

<p>Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance. The USCG anticipates award of a firm fixed price purchase order(s). This is an unrestricted solicitation.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>There are multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>Drawings or specifications are not available, and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Deliver to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001.

Origin must include shipping cost in order to be considered responsive.</p>
<p>Packaging, packing, and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Packaging material shall not consist of the following: popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut packaging. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate National Stock Number, Part Number, Nomenclature, Quantity, Purchase Order and Line Item Number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage. Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(End of clause)<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote which shall be considered by the agency. Any amendment and documents related to this procurement will be available electronically at the Internet site: http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the documents related to this procurement, if any.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is July 20, 2010 at 3:00 P.M., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about July 22, 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<a href="mailto:ryan.palmer4@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment to BAA W911W6-10-R-0008 is to publish all questions and responses received and provided to date.<BR><BR>Q and A (Set 1): <BR><BR>Question 1:  Is this the same thing as the Reconfigurable Rotor that AATD talked about on Industry Day back in February or is this something else?  <BR><BR>Response 1:  This is to confirm that subject BAA is the same program discussed at Industry Day. As described in the BAA synopsis, Active Rotor Component Demonstration represents the first phase of the Reconfigurable Rotors program. The goal of this first phase is to mature those active and passive technologies that address the most pressing technical challenges of an optimized high performance rotor system. Subsequent work will address the overall Reconfigurable Rotors goal of demonstrating significant performance improvements at the integrated, full scale rotor system level.<BR><BR>Question 2: Would you welcome an active sensing technology platform to be evaluated as control signals on any actuator that may be developed elsewhere? <BR><BR>Response 2:  The technologies proposed must address the Reconfigurable Rotors objectives of improved rotor figure of merit, improved isolated rotor L/De, reduced rotor vibrations, and/or reduced acoustic signatures. If you can show how the active sensing technology enables any of these metrics to be met, then you are welcome to submit a proposal. All proposals will be evaluated against the stated evaluation criteria.<BR><BR>Question 3: The objectives of AATDs Reconfigurable Rotor program seem similar to/overlapping with DARPAs Mission Adaptive Rotor (MAR) program. There appears to be potential duplication of effort. Is it likely the two programs will be merged in a later phase, or does the Reconfiguration Rotor program have distinct objectives/requirements that would keep them as separate efforts?<BR><BR>Response 3: The US Army is actively contributing to Phase 1 of the DARPA MAR program. This BAA is complementary to the MAR program, not duplicative. The Reconfigurable Rotors program was broken into two phases so that both the Army and DARPA efforts would be aligned.  At the end of MAR Phase 1, the Army will evaluate the maturity and risk levels of the MAR technologies, determine how they meet the Reconfigurable Rotors program objectives, and decide on the best course of action for Phase 2 of Reconfigurable Rotors. One potential outcome is a joint Army-DARPA MAR Phase 2 program. The Army remains interested in adaptive rotor technologies and looks forward to continued collaboration with DARPA.<BR><BR>Question 4: I am looking at the Solicitation Number W911W6-10-R-0008 and have a technology that I think fits the program. I would like to talk to you about this opportunity, when would be a good time to contact you regarding this solicitation.<BR><BR>Response 4: Please refer to FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition and the guidelines set forth in BAA announcement W911W6-10-R-0008.<BR><BR>Question 5: Does the Government reserve the right to accept proposals in their entirety or select only portions of proposals for award?<BR><BR>Response 5: As this is a BAA, the Government reserves the right to accept proposals in their entirety or in part.<BR><BR>Question 6: Does the Government reserve the right, if warranted, to segregate portions of resulting awards into pre-priced options?<BR><BR>Response 6: The Government reserves the right to include pre-priced options in any resulting award.<BR><BR>Question 7: If the proposed effort is inherently divisible and nothing is gained from the aggregation, should proposers consider submitting multiple independent efforts?<BR><BR>Response 7: As stated in the BAA synopsis, offerors may submit multiple proposals.<BR><BR>Question 8: To avoid a sizable cost volume, can we provide the backup pricing information (i.e., supplier quotes, basis of estimates, and additional pricing data/analyses) on the electronic copy (CD ROM disk format). The hard copy would then point to the CD for the cost details.<BR><BR>Response 8: In addition to the electronic copy, backup pricing information (i.e. supplier quotes, basis of estimates, and additional pricing data/analysis) must be submitted in original copy format.<BR><BR>Question 9: BAA states that the solicitation is for commercial items prepared in FAR 12.6 format. Please clarify whether proposals for non-commercial items will be entertained.<BR><BR>Response 9: Proposals for non-commercial items will be evaluated and entertained. <BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following clarifications:

With regard to the existing cinder block wall, there is currently no hole in the outer wall for venting.  There are no specific limitations; however, quoters should quote reasonable vents. 

Reference SOW paragraph 1.1.3: The door shall have at minimum a 16 inch diameter if it is cylindrical. If not cylindrical, there should be ample working area with an equivalent or greater amount of area. 

Reference SOW paragraph 1.1.4: The viewing port shall have at least a 6 inch in diameter if cylindrical.  If not cylindrical, there should be ample working area with an equivalent or greater amount of area.  The viewing port lens shall be replaceable if it is made of a material which will become damaged.  A clear image should be achievable in every test.  The system shall be sealed.  Wire ports will need to be sealed such that no vapors exit the system when not exiting through the vent.  

Reference SOW paragraph 1.3: The vent shall be installed such that wildlife cannot penetrate into the building. 

Along with these clarifications, this amendment serves to extend the response date of this RFQ from 7 July 2010 to 12 July 2010. 

Please acknowledge that you have read this amendment as well as any previous and future amendments.

<DESC>1.  THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN EXTENDED THRU JULY 19, 2010 AT 1:00PM.

2.  DUE TO NO DECISION HAS BEEN FINALIZE YET ON WHETHER THE LIBRARY WANTS THE PROTOTYPE SAMPLE  BEFORE AWARD OR A SHOP SAMPLE DRAWINGS WITH SPECIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION.

3.  PLEASE HOLD OFF ISSUING A YOUR POSPOSAL ON JULY 1, 2010.

4.  HOPE TO HAVE THIS RESOLVED BY JULY 2, 2010 OR EARLY.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW VIA EMAIL TO adoz@loc.gov


The purpose of modification 0004 is to clarify when the sample is due and to reflect the change in the response date to July 13 instead of July 19 do to the urgency of these security bins. The bin quantity has been reduce to 40 instead of 70.

1.  The library needs to make sure that all vendors are capable of manufacturing the security bins in a timely matter; therefore we expect vendors to have experience with the special type of material requested.

2.  To evaluate the vendor capabilities we are asking for pre-award samples?  However, we understand that this may be complicated for some vendors.  

Answers to last minutes questions:

3.  How soon do you need the bins after receipt of award?
The Library needs the bins as soon as possible.  We expect that the vendor can produce the security bins within 30 days (MAX 60 Days) after award.

4.  How important is the Prototype before award or could it be after award?  
The Prototype before the award gives us (LC) the condition to evaluate vendor capable of manufacturing such special material on a timely manner.  The material is needed as soon as possible to maintain critical operations of LC in place.

The modification is to reflect the change in the response time.

5.  The proposal  was due July 1, 2010 with no time to produce the prototype of it is to be submitted with the response?
We will also consider shop drawing and pictures of what vendors are planning to do together with detailed technical description; but preference should be give to those, who can provide a pre-award sample for evaluation.

6.  The Library is not responsible for re-imbursement of your prototype


7.  On the plans the fixed side is shown as 3/8" plywood.  In the spec's it is called out    as 1/2".  Which is correct?

BOTH ARE FINE. VENDOR SHOULD PROVIDE THE ONE HE THINKS WORKS BEST.

9.  In the specifications under "Sides and storage shelves"......It states that the fixed side and storage shelf to be 1/2" Baltic Birch Plywood.  In the section above it states that the "truck, shelves, ends, and security top panels" are to be made from natural hard maple.  Please verify that only the front and back panels are to be made from Baltic Birch plywood.
ONLY FRONT AND BACK PANELS COULD BE MADE FROM BALTIC BIRCH PLYWOOD; EVERYTHING ELSE FROM NATURAL HARD MAPLE.

10.  Are we to provide the bullet key lock?  Is there a spec for it?
VENDOR TO PROVIDE KEY LOCK.

THE SECURITY BIN HAS BEEN DECREASE FROM 70 TO 40 BINS:

11.  Are all 40 of the units to be delivered by September 30, 2010?  The bid date is July 1, 2010. When will the low bidder be notified to build and ship the sample and when will the award and notice to proceed be given?  Is the delivery date negotiable?
AS REQUESTED, ALL UNITS TO BE PROVIDED BY SEPTEMBER 30TH . If Bid date gets extended, vendors are expected to provide security bins within 30 days after the award, not to exceed 60 days after the award.

12.  Under section C2 Scope, They state that the library intends to purchase "around" 70 security bins.  Will the final number be 70 and will they all be bought under one purchase order?

<p>Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance. The USCG anticipates award of a firm fixed price purchase order(s). This is an unrestricted solicitation.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>There are multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>Drawings or specifications are not available, and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Deliver to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001. Offers should indicate nomenclature, part number, unit price, and extended price, plus the FOB point, any discounts for prompt payment, business size standards, and minority classifications. Earlier deliveries are desired and will be accepted. F.O.B. Destination is requested as the F.O.B. point for the Deliverables. F.O.B. Origin must include shipping cost in order to be considered responsive.</p>
<p>Packaging, packing, and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Packaging material shall not consist of the following: popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut packaging. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate National Stock Number, Part Number, Nomenclature, Quantity, Purchase Order and Line Item Number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage. Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage. Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration, or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer, Ms. Terry Clark (316-759-4525) for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>The FBO announcement for Solicitation No. R10PS10035 appeared on June 29, 2010. This purpose of this amendment  is to clarify the e-mail address that offerors are to use when requesting a copy of the solicitation DVD. Please see the original announcement for more detail regarding content of requests for the DVD. The e-mail address to send requests for the solicitation DVD to is: gen-PNR-TPPCrane@usbr.gov. The entire address is 25 characters long and it includes two dashes and no underscore characters. Due to some inherent limitations of the software we are required to use to post our FBO notices, the e-mail address cannot be displayed as a 'live' HTML link at the FBO website. Offerors will need to cut-and-paste the entire 25 character e-mail address into their e-mail client/system. We apologize for this inconvenience.

<DESC>Revised Pre-Solicitation Notice
(This notice has been corrected from the intital posting to update the anticipated release date of the solicitation.  No other changes have been made)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research & Development (ORD) is seeking contractor support on a requirement entitled An Exposure /Dose model for Integrative Risk Assessments. This requirement involves extensive research efforts on multimedia, multiroute, and multipathway exposure and dose modeling.  The availability of the Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies (MENTOR) and Dose Response Information and Analysis (DORIAN) systems in the public domain has made it possible to apply state-of-the-art approaches in forward and inverse exposure modeling for systematically characterizing and evaluating critical issues and gaps in a comprehensive risk assessment framework for multimedia environmental toxicants. USEPA needs these tools to be part of the operational tools for risk assessment.  
The purpose of this effort is to provide USEPA scientific staff with novel computational modeling and informatics tools including databases, demonstrations and evaluations that can be used to support integrative risk assessments.  These tools are to be delivered in a customized user-oriented platform that will facilitate their future application to a wide range of exposure studies.  It is proposed to acquire a user-oriented, customized implementation of MENTOR in modeling cumulative and aggregate exposures and doses to arsenic (As) and its compounds. Arsenic was selected as a ?model chemical? because it is a multimedia contaminant with multiple routes and pathways of exposure and a variety of chemical forms, toxicity endpoints, and modes of action. 
The EPA is seeking a contractor to (1) compile and document available data sources required for population exposure and dose modeling, (2) produce, evaluate, and deliver state-of-the art modeling approaches for forward modeling for exposure and dose estimation, (3) produce, evaluate and deliver state-of-the-art approaches for inverse exposure modeling from available biomarker data, and (4) perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis and identify data gaps in forward and inverse modeling of exposure; develop recommendations for future data collection efforts.  
The emphasis will be on cumulative and aggregate exposures to multimedia contaminants that involve multiple routes (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, dermal absorption) and pathways (diet, drinking water, etc.), specifically:
1. Demonstration and evaluation of a user-oriented operational system employing state-of-the-art, forward and inverse modeling methods and comprehensive databases for assessing cumulative and aggregate exposures and doses for risk characterizations involving multimedia chemicals.
2. Characterization and reduction of uncertainties in exposure and dose modeling in multimedia contaminant risk assessments and development of recommendations on priorities for filling data gaps and performing focused research tasks related to specific applications.
3. Development and optimization of informal guidelines and other supporting material to facilitate future applications of the delivered modeling system to a wide range of risk assessment problems involving multimedia chemicals.
4. A demonstration and evaluation, using arsenic as the contaminant, to improve various elements of the risk assessment process, not only for arsenic but also for a multitude of multimedia inorganic and organic contaminants of interest to USEPA.
The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract to span a 2 year duration. THE ANTICIPATED SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER AND THE CLOSE DATE SHALL BE APPROXIMATELY 30 DAYS THEREAFTER.  The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis, with no small business set-aside. A copy of the solicitation will be available at the following location: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The point of contact is Nicole Modafari, Contract Specialist, at 513-487-2001, Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>This posting is a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management Program.  The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment.<BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE).  The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE.  SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability.  <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements.  SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements.  The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables.  The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network.  These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter.  New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight.  SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512.  The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition).  The Government anticipates that the SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.   This is a Draft RFP and PEO STRI anticipates issuing the final RFP on 16 August 2010.<BR><BR>The SE Core CVE Management anticipated funding profile by fiscal year (FY) is provided <BR>below:<BR><BR>FY11  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $8M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M, SW Development - $9M<BR>	Total: $19.75M<BR><BR>FY12  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $10.8M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M, SW Development - $4M<BR>	Total: $17.55M<BR><BR>FY13  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $8.8M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>	Total: $11.55M<BR><BR>FY14  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $9.7M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>	Total: $12.45M<BR><BR>FY15  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $19.5M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>	Total: $22.25M<BR><BR>Questions/Comments:  Any questions or comments on the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing via email to all POCs listed below no later than 3:30PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 16 July 2010. <BR><BR>Reference: The Synopsis for this SE Core action was posted to Fedbizopps on 2 July 2010.<BR><BR>The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for Bid and Proposal (B&P) costs for Offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.<BR><BR>Note: A revision to Attachment 10, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) List was posted on 6 July 2010.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation<BR>SFAE-STRI-KOP<BR>12350 Research Parkway<BR>Orlando, FL 32826<BR><BR>Points of Contact:<BR>Laura Parsons, Contract Specialist - 407-380-8036; laura.parsons@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Lauren Bushika, Contract Specialist - 407-208-3343; lauren.bushika@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Milton Washington, Contracting Officer  407-381-8854; milton.washington@us.army.mil<BR>

Questions and Answers:
Q:  What are the limits of Subcontracting for small businesses? 
A:  FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Services: (except Construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.
Q:  Is a Florida or Puerto Rico License required?
A:  Yes, a copy must be submitted with the SF330 Package.  Architectual firm shall be licenced and located in the State of Florida and or the Comunwealth of Puerto Rico or both, depending on which Region applying for.
Q:  In the recently released solicitation notices for A/E support for VISN 8 in the North and South Regions, Item 8 of this notice indicates that independent and separate contracts for each of the following specialties to be awarded?
(1) one Contract for Fire Protection Engineer;
(1) one Contract for Professional Cost Estimator, and
(1) one Contract for Commissioning Engineer.
A: Firms with highly qualified staff in all of these disciplines may be considered for a single award of all three disciplines.  However, individual contracts for each of these 3 disciplines may be awarded.
Q: Will these be three separate contracts for each discipline in each Region?
A:  The intent is yes.  But there may be one contract awarded for the three disciplines.   There are many factors affecting the award decision. i.e. Experience, qualifications or socioeconomic status, availability of contractors for both the North and South Regions and the elimination of potential conflict of interest.
Q:  We are considering submitting for the commissioning portion separately, but will probably be teaming with architectural teams to pursue the IDIQ Multiple Awards contracts.  If we were awarded a commissioning contract as well as being selected on a team for the A/E services, how might that be a problem, or would it be an issue at all?
A:  That will present a conflict of interest issue; particularly, if you provide Commissioning, Fire Protection or Cost Estimating services as part of an A&E team.  You therefore, cannot validate your own work, under the independent contract.  For now you may apply for both.  I expect there may be sufficient participants in a project of this magnitude.  Therefore, selection will be made to participants who were not selected as part of an architectural team, but may have also applied for the independent disciplines.
Q:  Could the Cost Estimator and or the Fire Protection reviews/validation be accomplished electronically?
A:  Yes.
Q:  What criteria will be used for selection?
A:  SF330's, qualifications, specialized hospital experience, types of projects, complexity, estimating abilities, capabilities, design accuracy, timeliness,  location, available resources, past performance, accuracy of the work performed and litigation.  In short, any favorable trait the customer would want in a contractor for repeat business.  This evaluation is subjective based on how the information is presented and the interpretation of the evaluation team.
Q:  Is the intent to have several SDVOSB/VOSB/8a disciplines submit (individually as firms) and then choose companies that "collectively" can fulfill all of the services required for the IDIQ?
A:  The intent is to have several SDVOSB/VOSB/8a firms submit individually, and then select highly qualified companies that "collectively" can fulfill all of the services required for the IDIQ. i.e. Each team, should at least, have of the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines be members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural, Envionmental, Cost Estimatin, Commissioning, Fire Protection, etc.
Q:  What is the small business criteria and how is it determined?
A:  The size standards rules are the same for all. Visit www.sba.gov.  Each procurement use a 6 digit code representing the commodity or service being procured. i.e. 541310 is the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) code representing Architectural & Engineering Services, small business standard $4.5 million.   To be considered a small business, in any category, the average annual gross receipts cannot exceed, the value assigned buy SBA of any NAICS code, over the last 3 years.  Hence, $4.5 million for this code.
Q:  A "partial set aside with preference for SDVOSB, VOSB, 8a and Hub zone firms.  Will firms who do not fall in any of those categories be allowed to summit SF330's?    
A: Yes, but see Para 3 of the solicitation announcement.  
"	This means that out of the 10 estimated Architectural awards, we set aside 6 contracts for small business, for each region.   
"	If insufficient qualified firms are not identified during the SF330 evaluation process, we may award to large businesses.  
"	Conversely, if sufficient qualified small businesses are identified, then we reserve the right to award all contracts to small businesses.
"	Unlike the traditional cascading procurements, this procurement will evaluate all participants IAW the Brooks Act, before making an award decision.

The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  Furthermore, if discussions are to be conducted the Government will establish a competitive range.  The competitive range shall be comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306(c)(2).  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

1.  Technical Acceptability: The Government's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) shall evaluate the Offeror's technical proposal on a pass/fail basis. 

2.  Price: Award will be made to the offeror that proposes the lowest price and is determined to be technically acceptable.  


PROPOSAL SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS

Proposals shall be submitted electronically to tracy.marasco@va.gov followed by hard copies sent to the Contracting Officer. See mailing address in Block 8 of the Standard Form 1442. 

Standard Form 1442 with blocks 14 through 20 properly filled-out by the offeror.

PRICE. As a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection, price is the discriminating factor for award among those offers that are technically acceptable. Offers that are not technically acceptable cannot be selected, regardless of price. Price is to be submitted in Block 17 of the Standard Form 1442. 

Documentation of Technical Acceptability: Technical acceptability will be based on the following factors: 

1.	PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE.  Identify the offeror's past and present experience in performing work in a hospital, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center or Department of Defense medical facility. The qualifying project[s] must also fall within the same magnitude or greater. Provide evidence of minimum of 3 contracts completed within the last 3 years with the following information:

o	Project scope of work or detailed description 
o	Contract completion date, or percent completed as of solicitation due date 
o	Contract Numbers 
o	Contract Values 
o	Location 
o	Type of Contract - Federal, State, Private 
o	Point of Contact (email address and phone number) 

2. KEY PERSONNEL.  Identify superintendent who will be assigned to this project and provide evidence (i.e. resume) of the following:

"	Superintendent must have a minimum of 5 years of experience as superintendent.  Identify experience managing or supervising projects of similar size and scope.  Superintendent shall have a valid 30-hour OSHA certificate.
o	Provide evidence that superintendent has experience managing subcontractors
o	Provide evidence of superintendent's 30-hour OSHA certificate.

NOTE 1: In accordance with the clause below.  The superintendent must be an employee of the Prime/General Contractor.  The Government has not privity of contract with any subcontractor and therefore, cannot consider the subcontractor's employee as having authority to act for the Prime Contractor.

52.236-6 Superintendence by the Contractor. (Apr 1984)
At all times during performance of this contract and until the work is completed and accepted, the Contractor shall directly superintend the work or assign and have on the worksite a competent superintendent who is satisfactory to the Contracting Officer and has authority to act for the Contractor.
                                                (End of Clause)

NOTE 2: If the person you are offering to be the superintendent is not a current employee of your company, but intends to become one upon award of the contract, you must submit a letter of commitment from that person (signed by potential superintendent) to prove you will be hiring him/her and he/she intends to accept that position.


3.  PERCENTAGE OF WORK COMPLETED BY THE SDVOSB.
"	Offerors shall provide a percentage breakdown of the labor costs to be performed on the contract.  Specifically, the offeror must indicate the percentage of work to be performed by the SDVOSB prime contractor, any SDVOSB sub-contractor and all other sub-contractors.  This is a mandatory requirement; it should not exceed two pages. (See FAR 52.219-14 and VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside)

<DESC><strong>&nbsp; Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />In accordance with FAR 6.302 and 6.305, this notice of contract award is posted.</strong>
<p>(1).Nature and/or description of the action being approved. Justification to enter into a contract with other than full and open competition based upon Unusual and Compelling Urgency, 41 USC 253(c)(2).</p>
<p>(2).Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). Conduct testing to determine affect, if any, Electro-Magnetic Interference may have on operation of certain automobiles. Ceiling Amount of the contract is established at $211,625.00.</p>
<p>(3).Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 41 U.S.C 253(c )(2).</p>
<p>(4).A demonstration that nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. In order to meet an Agency-established deadline for reporting to Congress, research and reporting on the affects Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) may have on the operation of certain automobiles must be completed by no later than August 31, 2010. The need to use an advanced test facility to support this requirement was not identified until early June 2010 leaving less than three months to complete the project. Meeting the August 31, 2010 deadline would not have been possible if full and open competitive procedures were followed.</p>
<p>(5).A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: Do to the unusual and compelling urgency associated with this unique project, soliciting offers from more than one source was not possible.</p>

<p>(7).A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. Market research was conducted to the extent time permitted. Through this market research, the government was able to identify the contractor which would best fulfill the technical need of this contract within the established time constraints.</p>
<p>(8).Other information: Due to the unique nature of this procurement, a similar follow-on procurement is not expected. If, in the unlikely event a follow-on procurement is required, then competition will be sought to the maximum extent practicable. <br />A contract for which this Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition was prepared was awarded on June 23, 2010 to Chrysler LLC of Auburn Hills, MI in the amount of $211,625.00.</p>

<DESC>This contract is being issued as a response off of Broad Agency Announcement N68335-10-R-0009.<br /><br />The contractor will be performing air vehicle sensor demonstrations, and flight tests to investigate and evaluate improvements in the operational efficiency of unique air vehicles as sensor platforms for persistent surveillance/Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) missions. The overall goal is to develop, determine, and understand distinctive airborne sensor integration and verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the platforms related to the installed sensor and communication packages.
<p>This acquisition is for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract is the most appropriate contracting vehicle because this is a type of a cost reimbursement contract that provides for payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee (profit) that is fixed at the inception of the contract, per FAR 16.306(a). Additionally, the fixed fee does not vary with actual cost but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract, in which this flexibility is desirable for this effort. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract is ideal as it allows for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but gives the contractor less incentive to control costs than a fixed price contract.</p>

<AWARDEE>SPANISH SPRINGS CONSTRUCTION, INC.;9732 STATE ROUTE 445;SPARKS;NV;894416258
<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition

This sole source justification is being submitted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Construction Support Division (CSD), 811 Vermont Ave NW, Washington DC 20571, for a project at Massachusetts National Cemetery, Bourne MA.

Solicitation VA-786A-10-RP-0093 is for an emergency gravesite expansion project at the Massachusetts National Cemetery.  The request is for this  solicitation to be sole sourced in accordance with PL 109-461 and the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f), to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) . 

One of VA's primary missions is to assure that the burial needs of veterans and their families are met.  In Fiscal Year 2008, funding was appropriated for the development of an expansion to Massachusetts National Cemetery at Borne, Massachusetts.  Delays beyond the control of VA are seriously jeopardizing the agency's ability to fulfill our mission.

The Capital Improvement Proposal (CIP) and Budget Prospectus for the anticipated project design placed the AE contract on a path to completion of Contract Documents by January 2010, a construction start by May 2010, and completion date of April 2010.  An early turn-over of 2100 gravesites was included in the scope of the project to ensure the availability of new gravesites in December of 2010.  This date was determined by program planning staff at NCA's Memorial Service Network 1 office located in Philadelphia after the review of current gravesite layout plans and an extensive onsite staff survey for any remaining potential for gravesite development opportunities.

VA's design consultant, retained on March 31, 2009 to prepare Construction Documents notified the Project Manager, shortly after the delivery of the 95% Construction Document submission, that the firm was closing their business and unable to complete the project under the original terms of the contract.  The contract has since been terminated for default.

Massachusetts National Cemetery, located on the Cape has been open continuously since 1980 to casketed and cremain burials.  This facility is the 15th busiest national cemetery in the nation and serves as the only burial option available to Veterans and their dependents in the greater Boston area and eastern Massachusetts.  Since December 6, 2001, the National Cemetery Administration has interred 20 soldiers serving in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom at this cemetery.  Massachusetts National Cemetery serves a veteran population of approximately 400,000 veterans within the 75 mile service area.  The temporary lost of this final lasting benefit to Veterans and their families would be onerous and cause a significant public outcry and controversy.

The lack of available national cemetery burial sites in eastern Massachusetts will require veterans be temporarily interred at other facilities such as Massachusetts State Veterans Cemetery in Agawam or Winchendon, located respectively or a two hour drive to either location, until space becomes available at Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne.  This arrangement would become a sizable burden on the state veteran cemetery operation that is budgeted by the state for a significantly smaller scale of operation.  These options are an additional expense to the veteran and are not consistent with the VA's mission or policy.





Massachusetts National Cemetery has an annual first interment rate of approximately one thousand four hundred (1,400) full casket burials per year.  With less than one thousand (1,000) burial sites left, the demand for first interment burials will exceed available supply in approximately seven (7) months.  As of the date of this request, the Cemetery projects a total depletion of burial sites by December 2010.  This project will keep Massachusetts National Cemetery operational, in lieu of being closed.

There have not been any written expressions of interest in this project, but it will be advertised, as required, on FedBizOpps.

Sole sourcing to a SDVOSB at this particular time, is in the best interest of the Government.

To the best of my knowledge and belief the facts as stated above are true and correct.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<AWDNBR>VA687-C05101
<ARCHDATE>08052010
<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
ONLY ONE SOURCE REASONABLY AVAILABLE (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1))
STEAM DAMAGE REMEDIATION, BUILDING 74

The VAMC, Walla Walla, has a requirement for remediation services for damage caused by a steam leak.

FINDINGS

The responsible contracting officer documents the following finds:

1.	The mold that is present due to the environment cause by the steam leak requires prompt remediation to prevent further damage to the building and to prevent development of an environment that is a health concern;
2.	The only reasonable provider of the necessary services under such short notice is 1st Choice Restoration, Inc; 
3.	1st Choice Restoration is a small business; and
4.	The process of soliciting and evaluating proposals would cause undue delay of the work.

DETERMINATION

In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(10 and based on these findings it is the judgment of this Contracting Officer that 1st Choice Restoration, Inc. is the only source reasonably available for the procurement of these services.
