In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Patrick Campbell at (405) 734-8119; fax (405) 734-8129, or e-mail patrick.campbell2@tinker.af.mil

<DESC><p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor will utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remit those payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations with respect to appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) which will educate providers with respect to the Medicare program; will respond to provider telephone and written inquiries; will respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and will make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of provider services, such as enrollment of new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers with respect to Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction N (which includes the states and territories of Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) on or about November 9, 2012. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is January 11, 2013 with an anticipated award date of May 17, 2013.<br /><br /><br />This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This market survey is being reissued because of a change in the size standard for the applicable NAICS code.   For code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, the small business size limit is now $14 million dollars of average annual revenue.
From time to time, the Office of Airport Planning and Programming requires consultant or contract services to perform functions that are beyond the resources or capacity of in house FAA personnel.  The Office of Airport Planning and Programming establishes policies, standards and guidance in support of airport planning and environmental processing, and administers the FAA's financial assistance programsthe Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) programs.  There is a high degree of overlap and interrelationship among these three areas, as well as interaction with other parts of the Office of Airports and other parts of the FAA. 
Therefore, the FAA is considering procuring an indefinite-quantity, indefinite delivery consultant contract to support these requirements if and when they arise.

As such the laser requires a new pair of harmonic generating crystals to convert the Nd-YAG fundamental to 266nm.  In addition the laser electronics must be tested and repaired as needed.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Newport Corporation, Spectra Physics Division pursuit to FAR 13.106 for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  It is our understanding that the design of the Newport Corporation's laser is proprietary, thus the only vendor for the goods and services required.

<a href="mailto:sylvia.aragon-1@nasa.gov">Sylvia  Aragon</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for services in support of the continued development of autopilot systems for NASAs T-38N and WB-57F aircraft fleets located at Ellington Field (EFD) in Houston, Texas. NASA intends to integrate a new autopilot system into its T-38N Aircraft Fleet to comply with Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) equipment requirements.  RVSM compliance is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirement to fly in certain air spaces. Lack of RVSM compliance restricts the ability of the T-38N to fly in RVSM air space and limits the full potential of T-38N fuel efficiency. The required services support twenty-one T-38N aircraft. The T-38N Talon is a two-place, twin turbojet, swept-wing, supersonic aircraft originally designed for the United States Air Force (USAF) as a high performance trainer and is fully aerobatic with loop and roll flight capabilities. NASA currently uses a modified version of the USAF T-38A aircraft (designated the T-38N) primarily for astronaut proficiency training.  The required services also provide support for the development of autopilot systems needed for the fleet of three WB-57F aircraft.	Due to high altitude performance requirements, an autopilot is essential to ensure the WB-57F stays within certain limited windows of performance.  The WB-57F fleet currently has operational autopilots installed, but due to obsolescence issues the autopilot systems have become unsustainable. The WB-57F is a mid-wing, high altitude, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time.  Work on the new autopilot systems to date, for both the T-38N and WB-57F fleets, has been performed by the Aircraft Solutions Branch of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). This organization is in the process of being sold to American Systems Corporation (ASC) and will be doing business as part of the American Systems Corporation, Test and Evaluation Services Division. The hardware associated with the T-38N autopilot contains software and algorithms that were developed solely by ASC under NASA Space Act Agreement (SAA) SAA-AT-07-016. This data is proprietary to ASC. In the development of the WB-57F autopilot, ASC has gained a unique understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics and flight control system under NASA Contract NNJ11JB28C. NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services and hardware from ASC on a sole source basis to complete the new autopilot development and procure autopilot systems for the NASA T-38N and WB-57F Aircraft Fleets. Only ASC has the specialized knowledge of the software and hardware already developed, maintaining proprietary data rights for these efforts. ASCs unique knowledge and experience is critical to the integrity of the autopilot projects. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Sylvia Aragon no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 24, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	   .

This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00383-09-G-001D with BAE Systems Information, NY (Cage Code 80249,72314) and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for the update of Attachment A for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the Navy Weapons System manufactured and repair

However, individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under this Navy Weapons System.  A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVICP BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact. 

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>07 DEC 2012</p>
<p><br />The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to increase the ordering maximum amount for a Multiple Award IDIQ contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, on or about 21 DEC 2012 to Rolls Royce Naval Marine Inc. under Contract Number N00014-09-D-0680. The current ordering period expires 17 AUG 2014.</p>
<p>The prospective contractor shall research and develop a non-pitch adapting composite propeller with similar objective to the pitch-adapting propeller research already performed under Delivery Order 0002 of this Multiple Award IDIQ. Further, the prospective contractor will use an iteration process to develop a prototype non-pitch adapting composite propeller.</p>
<p>ONR intends to increase the ordering amount on a sole source basis to Rolls Royce because Rolls Royce has proven to be the only offeror capable of performing to the Government's current requirements. Two awards resulted under the original BAA Solicitation. Under Phase I of this program, the Program Officer determined that only Rolls Royce met the minimum government requirements for a Phase II award. Few large ship propeller manufacturers, RRNMI inclusive, exist that have the resources and ability to research and develop new propeller composite materials and manufacturing processes for the US Navy. As such, RRNMI is a uniquely capable offeror given their expertise both within the industry and their comprehension gained under performance of this IDIQ contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541712 with the size standard of 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by ONR. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the products/services stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML), Sensor Science Division (SSD) Ultraviolet Radiation Group is seeking vendors who are a capable of providing services to upgrade the existing Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III) in order to better support the needs of its industrial user base and to maintain NIST in a world leadership position for radiometric standards.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is NOT a request for proposal, a promise to contract or a commitment of any kind. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any vendor for presentations, travel, marketing efforts or data offered for examination, therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the Ultraviolet Radiation Group is to provide the foundation for metrology and testing in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region of the spectrum. This includes the maintenance and continuous improvement of the national primary standards for UV radiation in support of UV-based science and applications and the development of improved measurement and testing techniques for various scientific and industrial applications involving UV radiation.</p>
<p>In order for NIST to remain at the forefront of this very important area of active research, and to be able to compete with growing number of international facilities, the SURF III facility must be upgraded and continually maintained at optimal operation. The synchrotron upgrades will improve NIST's ability to serve the needs of the scientific and industrial communities, as well as benefiting other important research activities at SURF III such as absolute cryogenic radiometry, standard light source development, and NASA and NOAA satellite calibrations. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel and services to complete tasks for the upgrade.</p>
<p>The primary cooling system for the NIST synchrotron is a closed-loop, circulating water system that is capable of dissipating more than 100 kW of heat load with a flow rate of 50 gallons/minute. This water cools a high-current magnet, as well as a variety of other high-power subsystems. The high-current magnet is comprised of six pancake coil assemblies electrically connected in series. Because of the high power dissipation in the magnet windings, it is necessary to supply the cooling water in parallel to minimize the temperature rise in the coils. Therefore, leakage currents through the water itself become a major concern because they directly impact the stability of the magnetic field, and hence the usability of the synchrotron for radiometric purposes. In order to reduce the leakage currents, the water is deionized such that its resistivity is higher than 10 MOhm*cm. Unfortunately, because the water comes in direct contact with materials such as copper and brass, the corrosive nature of deionized water results in a loss of material from these critical structures. The Contractor shall implement the recommendations to return the loss rate of material from the high-power structures to acceptable values once authorized by the Government. A monitoring system shall also be employed to evaluate the properties of the cooling system in real time.</p>
<p>The precision 1250 A, 200 V magnet power supply used for generating the magnetic field that holds the circulating electron beam in orbit is a microprocessor-based high power system that needs to be 100% reliable so that the facility can run autonomously at night. Unfortunately, it has been found that the unit often experiences fault conditions that prevent its operation. In the past, when the frequency of such disruptions was low, these occasional service interruptions had a minimal impact on operations. However, as the frequency of these events has increased, so has the impact on the operational capabilities. The Contractor shall study the design of the power supply's control system to determine what could cause such problems. Once the problems have been identified, the Contractor shall develop a mitigation strategy in order to overcome the unit's shortcomings. The Contractor shall implement the mitigation strategy once authorized by the Government. The Contractor shall integrate a hardware monitoring system for verification that interfaces directly to the control card of the supply.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be available, as required, in the operations of the SURF III facility by providing the ability to generate beams in accordance with customer needs and requirements. Operational expectations by customers include that SURF III function at a 95% uptime, a value that has historically been the case as determined by an operation log kept by SURF III personnel. The normal hours of operation of the SURF III facility are 08:00 to 20:00 hrs Monday thru Friday, so the Contractor must be available, if needed, to fulfill customer requirements during that timeframe. The Contractor shall also troubleshoot and resolve hardware problems that impact operations in a timely manner (response time measured in hours) as they arise in order to maximize available user beam time.</p>
<p>The interface to SURF III's physical hardware has evolved continuously over the years. Legacy systems with dedicated micro-processors are being replaced with more modern computers whose processing speed is more than sufficient to make up for the fact that modern computers inherently multitask. The Contractor shall aid in the upgrade of the SURF III's legacy control system to one that interfaces to the actual machine through more autonomous tributary controls. The Contractor shall aid in the transition to a computer based system by evaluating the present legacy system, and designing and building the necessary interface electronics. <br />Sources that have the ability to provide these services are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above. Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to NAICS code 541330 (Small Business size standard of $14.0 M), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA federal supply schedules (if applicable) under which your company can provide the products described in this notice, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years in which a similar instrument was provided.</p>
<p>All responses shall be emailed to Harry.Brubaker@nist.gov so that they are received no later than 5:00 pm EST December 21, 2012.</p>

<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Sources Sought Notice<br />Solicitation Number: Reference Number: HHS-NIH-NIAID(AI)-SBSS-2156<br />Posted Date: December 7, 2012<br />Original Response Date: December 21, 2012<br />Current Response Date: December 21, 2012<br />Original Archive Date: <br />Current Archive Date: <br />Classification Code: A -- Research &amp; Development<br />NAICS Code: 541712 -Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences</p>
<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether there are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts and supports epidemiological and clinical research on HIV/AIDS. Many of the large clinical and epidemiological studies funded by DAIDS collect biologic specimens from subjects for ongoing and future studies. The collection and storage of these specimens from HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects from many different research studies in a single repository is a valuable resource with which researchers can rapidly validate scientific hypotheses and algorithms for clinical decision-making. Well collected and maintained specimen collections coupled with epidemiologic data have facilitated research on the pathogenesis of HIV disease, development of novel drug approaches, prevention studies of potential microbicides and vaccines, and approaches for purging HIV reservoirs including "HIV Cure".</p>
<p>The NIAID Specimen Repository (NSR), first funded in 1988, is a storage and management program for biological specimens received from HIV positive and negative subjects enrolled in NIAID-sponsored vaccine and observational cohort studies. There are currently over 6 million specimens in the NSR and specimens are often aliquoted into multiple vials. The repository currently contains 160 ( 80&deg;C) mechanical freezers and 42 liquid nitrogen freezers. Inventory is currently managed through utilization of the Biological Specimen Inventory II (BSI-II) system.</p>
<p>The current seven-year contract with SeraCare BioServices, Inc., (contract #HHSN272200700060C) will expire on September 30, 2014.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This contract will support the continuation of current and future vaccine and epidemiological cohort study groups, referred to as Study Groups. The current NIAID Study Groups, noted in order of greatest to least numbers of stored specimens are: the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS); the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS); and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). The NSR also maintains specimens from other smaller NIAID-sponsored studies that have been completed. The NSR activities include the short, moderate and long-term specimen storage component of the domestic and international research of the Study Groups through receipt, cryopreservation, and storage of specimens from research sites that are either part of the Study Group (referred to as Sites), or laboratories collaborating with the Study Groups (referred to as external research groups). Retrieval and distribution of stored specimens by the NSR is guided by established scientific priorities of the Division of AIDS. Specimens include peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum, plasma, tissue and other bodily fluids or substances such as cervicovaginal lavage (CVL), semen, saliva, urine, feces, autopsy and biopsy materials and whole blood spots dried on filter paper. The specimens have been collected over many years from carefully chosen subjects and reflect the history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; specimens date from 1984. <br /><br />Project Requirements<br />The NSR should be capable of housing, operating and managing the NIAID Specimen Repository. Each specimen is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged or contaminated. Therefore, it is essential that the specimens be stored under optimal conditions to maintain their integrity and biological properties, which vary from specimen type to specimen type.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor will be required to:</p>
<p>A. Follow all Federal, State and local requirements and current best practices for the collection, handling, preservation, storage, retrieval and distribution of biological material for scientific research.</p>
<p>B. Manage Specimens, including: 1) acquiring specimens from Study Group sites; 2) storing specimens under optimal conditions to minimize loss, damage or contamination; 3) aliquoting specimens; 4) distributing specimens to qualified investigators including packaging, handling, and coordinating specimen shipments to domestic and international sites; and 5) withdrawing and destroying Repository specimens.</p>
<p>C. Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking of specimen receipt, processing, storage, inventory and distribution, rapid retrieval of specimens, and storage of QA/QC information associated with the specimen.</p>
<p>D. Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) Programs.</p>
<p>E. Ensure an orderly transition of the NIAID Specimen Repository at contract initiation.</p>
<p>F. Ensure an orderly transition of the NIAID Specimen Repository at contract termination.</p>
<p>G. Participate in meetings and teleconferences.</p>
<p>H. In addition to the services/quantities outlined above to be provided for the base period, the Government may exercise, at its discretion, options for additional level of effort as follows:</p>
<p>1) Options to extend the term of the contract to perform the same scope and types of activities outlined in the Statement of Work for the base period; and 2) Options to provide one (1) additional FTE for each option exercised to accommodate unanticipated increases in specimen acquisition, storage, and distribution which may be exercised 2 times in any year of the contract; and 3) Options to provide one (1) additional FTE for each option exercised to accommodate increases in specimen acquisition, storage, culturing, and distribution of TB specimens.

<DESC><br />SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT (SYNOPSIS): The purpose of this announcement is a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors for the following proposed 2-Step Design-Build Project: Convert, Remodel, and bring up to code a currently excess Unaccompanied Personnel Housing facility located at Arctic Avenue and 3rd Street on Fort Greely (Building 660), Alaska. Responsible sources having relevant experience and capabilities to perform the required work will be considered for determining the acquisition strategy for the subject project.
<p>This Sources Sought announcement is part of a market survey for information only to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. PROJECT IS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Convert, remodel, and bring up to code a currently excess Unaccompanied Personnel Housing facility located at Arctic Avenue and 3rd Street on Fort Greely (Building 660). Facility is to be converted to three category codes: 14183, 14185, and 73016. Specifically, the 1st floor will be designed for 73016 (Emergency Services/Police Station), the 2nd and 3rd floors will be designed for 14183 (Battalion Headquarters) and 14185 (Company Operations Facility). The bottom floor will be used for "common" functions such as arms rooms, supply rooms, and an EST trainer.</p>
<p>Building 660 is a 4-story building constructed in 1961 as an UPH barracks with dormitory rooms, gang latrines, food preparation, dining and administrative functions. The 1995 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action caused the majority of the building to become uninhabitable through 15 years of non-use and minimal maintenance. The 51,000 SF of UPH space has been listed as excess since Fort Greely was withdrawn from Army Surplus by Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in 2002. Major components of the facility are failing or have failed resulting in a current ISR-I rating Black. Currently the Network Enterprise Center (NEC) has equipment space for various wireless telecommunication systems and the Armed Forces Network. The installation's 911 Dispatch center is located in the basement and the 49th MDB utilizes space in the basement adjacent to the 911 Call Center for a simulator trainer.</p>
<p>This project repairs a 1960's era, 4-story building, providing adequate Emergency Services/Police Station, Battalion HQ, and COF functions. Most components of the building have failed or are failing and are unusable. Utilities have been shut off to a majority of the building. The project will demolish and remove all remaining exterior and interior finishes, fixtures and mechanical and electrical equipment. Hazardous material will be removed from the building during demolition including, but not limited to, lead based paint and asbestos. The facility's thermal envelope will be repaired through application of an exterior insulation finish system (EIFS), EPDM roof, and energy efficient doors and windows. Interior spaces will be repaired including, but not limited to, failed vinyl composite tile, drywall and wall studs, electrical panels, branch circuits and end devices, HVAC system, plumbing lines and fixtures and suspended ceiling grids. Repairs will also encompass the failing fire alarm system along with voice and data communications infrastructure in accordance to table 2-1 DA Pam 420-11. Repairs on building infrastructure will start at the main, outside the facility. Repairs on the electrical infrastructure will start at the transformer, external to the facility. The completed repair will conform to the ABA "Accessibility Design Guidelines for DoD Facilities" and other applicable codes. AT/FP will be repaired in accordance with UFC 4-010-01. Progressive Collapse cost was determined, included in the cost estimate, and based on the Occupancy Category (OC) in accordance to UFC 4-023-03, Design of Building to Resist Progressive Collapse.</p>
<p><br />INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Contract duration is 450 days and estimated cost range is between $6,000,000.00 to $15,000,000.00. NAICS is 236220. Size limitation is $33.5M.</p>
<p>&bull; All interested Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors should notify this office in writing by mail or email on or before 6 January 2013, 12:00 pm, Alaska Time. <br />&bull; Responses should include: <br />(1) Identification and verification that the company is certified by the Small Business Administration as a HUBZone or 8(a) contractor or self-certified as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, as applicable;</p>

<DESC>1. The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC) is issuing this sources sought announcement in order to perform market research primarily to determine if firms possess the ability to execute the requirements of an anticipated formal solicitation with an estimated contractual capacity of $250M over five (5) years. This sources sought announcement is not a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Therefore, we invite any size business to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs. <br /><br />2. Scope and Authority. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is the world-class provider of high performance computing capabilities for the United States Department of Defense (DOD). CEHNC and HPCMP have formally teamed to establish a path forward for future HPCMP requirements. This sources sought announcement seeks to evaluate industry's ability to provide sustainable, state-of-the-art, HPC capability for the DOD research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community. This capability will be introduced through a series of technology insertions (TIs) in direct support of the DOD HPCMP's mission - to accelerate the development and transition of advanced defense technologies into superior warfighting capabilities by exploiting and strengthening U.S. leadership in supercomputing, communications, and computational modeling. The HPCMP continues to enhance its ability to support DOD and the warfighter through the acquisition of balanced HPC systems for five (5) DOD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) and multiple Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs). The Government is interested in uncovering industry's ability to deliver balanced, commercially-available, production-grade HPC systems, which contain an appropriate combination of processor, memory, disk I/O, interconnect, and operating system (OS) capabilities in order to conduct complex, tightly-coupled, large-scale, scientific calculations. Salient system attributes include:
<p>&bull; A reasonably high byte to floating point operation (FLOP) count ratio (when comparing peak CPU memory bandwidth to peak CPU floating point capability),<br />&bull; 2GB to 3GB of memory capacity per computational core,<br />&bull; At least 50GB/s, 50GB/s, and 75GB/s of read, write, and full duplex bandwidth (respectively) between the compute and I/O subsystems for every 1,000 computational nodes in the system,<br />&bull; At least 20GB per core, 20GB per core, and 0.5GB per core of formatted usable disk storage for /work1, /work2, and /home (respectively),<br />&bull; A tightly integrated interconnect with <br />&nbsp; o Each link having at least 40Gb/s of network bandwidth <br />&nbsp; o An end-to-end latency that is less than 5&micro;s (five microseconds), <br />&bull; A well-tuned OS with low jitter.<br />If you are interested in this acquisition, please complete the market research survey attached to this sources sought announcement to facilitate the Government's formulation of an overall acquisition strategy.</p>

<DESC><p>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) intends to award an Order to GitHub Inc. on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for GitHub Enterprise Software.</p>
<p>Github Enterprise is the enterprise version of Github.com, a web service that allows software developers to track changes in software code, manage issues, and collaborate among developer teams. Github is based on Git, a framework for managing software source code. Git has become the industry standard source code management platform for software development teams, supplanting older tools like Subversion, CSV, and SourceSafe, which have been obviated by the creation of Git. Moreover, Git is what was built with whole teams in mind, as opposed to its older counterparts, whose centralized nature creates inconvenience and risk for development teams.</p>
<p>Github is the industry standard used to help developer teams easily implement a Git-based environment. It includes a full set of software project management features including issue tracking, issue assignment, documentation, and permissions. CFPB requires this feature set in a product that can be hosted inside an organization's firewall. While several products fulfill one of these requirements, Github Enterprise is the only product that fulfills both of them.</p>
<p>No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements, and is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to proceed with the sole-source award for 12 months to Github Enterprise.</p>
<p>Electronic submissions, in response to this special notice, shall be&nbsp;submitted prior to the specified response time to the attention of J. Weatherman referencing SS-CFPB-13-0014 and emailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>

The solicitation number is W912PF-13-T-0010 and this solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote (RFQ). The solicitation is unrestricted and all interested offerors shall submit written quotes (oral quotes will not be accepted). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 541930.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation is to provide from four (4) to twenty (20) French/English interpreters; eight (8) of the twenty (20) must have medical terminology knowledge. <br>  <br>  Offerors are required to indicate the daily cost of the interpreters including all costs per the attached Performance Work Statement including the Contract Manpower Reporting found in paragraph 11.

The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  <br>  <br> **** FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. <br>  <br> ****ADDENDUM <br> ****Each offeror shall submit three (3) items: <br>  <br> ****1. Provide a price in dollars for all contract line item(s): 0001 & 0002. <br>  <br> ****2.  Provide Technical Capability: see below. <br>  <br> ****3.  Provide three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires: see below. <br>  <br> The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  <br>  <br> Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  <br>  <br> The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br>  <br> 1. Technical Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement per 3. Specific Requirements in the PWS (including personnel resumes); <br>  <br> 2. Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires submitted as to whether the past performance is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance. In addition, failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining unsatisfactory performance. <br> Past Performance Evaluation Ratings: <br> Acceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance is unknown.  <br> Unacceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br> For Past Performance to be considered relevant, it must be similar in work and must be completed in the last three years from the date of this solicitation.  In the case of a quote without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the vendor shall be determined to have unknown past performance. Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for commercial information found at FAR Part 13 and as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation number is W912PF-13-T-0012 and this solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote (RFQ). The solicitation is unrestricted and all interested offerors shall submit written quotes (oral quotes will not be accepted).

Provide three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires: see below. <br>  <br> The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  <br>  <br> Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  <br>  <br> The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br>  <br> 1. Technical Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement per 3. Specific Recquirements in the PWS; <br>  <br> 2. Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires submitted as to whether the past performance is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance. In addition, failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining unsatisfactory performance. <br> Past Performance Evaluation Ratings: <br> Acceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance is unknown.  <br> Unacceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br> For Past Performance to be considered relevant, it must be similar in work and must be completed in the last three years from the date of this solicitation.  In the case of a quote without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the vendor shall be determined to have unknown past performance. Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance. The Government will consider the Past Performance information, as well as information obtained from any other sources.; and  <br> 3.  Price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing. <br>  <br> Clauses included: FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commerical Items; FAR 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.214-34 - Submission of Offers in the English Language; FAR 52.225-14 - Inconsistency Between English Version and Translation of Contract; FAR 52.225-17 - Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers; FAR 52.222-50 Combat Trafficking in Persons; FAR 52.228-3 Workers' Compensation Insurance (Defense Base Act); FAR 52.233-1 Disputes; FAR 52.233-3 Protest After Award; FAR 52.238-3 Workers Compensation Insurance; FAR 52.252-1 - Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.252-2 - Clauses Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.232-8- Discounts for Prompt Payment; FAR 52.237-2 Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation; FAR 52.242-15 - Stop-Work Order; DFARS 252.201-7000 Contracting Officer's Representative; DFARS 252.222-7002 Compliance with Local Labor Laws (Overseas); DFARS 252.223-7006 Prohibition on Storage and Disposal of Toxic and Hazardous Materials; DFARS 252.225-7041 Correspondence in English; DFARS 252.225-7042 Authorization to Perform; DFARS 252.225-7043 Antiterrorism/Force Protection for Defense Contractors Outside the United States; DFARS 252.232-7008 Assignment of Claims (Overseas).

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The proposed contract is set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns. Offers from other than Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns will not be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of <strong>12/27/2012</strong>. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. Proposed procurement contains a 50% option for increased quantities. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: 04836, 05RU8, 0CXJ6, 33436, 44W67 and 82918. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a need to acquire supplementary medical services for its field medical support program from board-certified physicians and other specified medical professionals in accordance with the criteria set forth in this statement of work.
<p>The Health Care Programs Unit (HCPU) within the Office of Medical Services is responsible for the management and administration of the FBI's Occupational and Emergency/Operational Medicine Programs across the entirety of Bureau operations. HCPU is the entity of the FBI responsible for addressing all medical concerns inherent in the FBI mission. The HCPU's goal is to conserve, promote, and maintain the physical and mental health of FBI employees. These activities include support of FBI operations in the field.</p>
<p>The FBI mission includes crisis response to domestic and international terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) investigations and the performance of complex criminal investigations. All of these activities can occur in austere and hazardous environments. Examples include international deployments to Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East as well as domestic crisis response to the 9/11/2001 attack sites, investigation of the use of anthrax against the public in Florida, New York City and Washington, DC and Federal support to local law enforcement during Hurricane KATRINA.</p>
<p>As an agency of the civilian Federal Government, the FBI conforms to civilian standards of professional credentialing and certification, health care delivery and medical supervision. As a domestic law enforcement agency, the FBI must provide medical support in a manner consistent with the laws, policies and procedures required in civilian police operations. As an intelligence and counterterrorism agency, FBI medical support must be provided in a manner consistent with the requirements of sensitive national security matters.</p>
<p>The Emergency Medical Support Program (EMSP) of HCPU was established in 1999 to provide medical oversight and on-site support for FBI field operations. Standardized medical procedures, equipment specifications and education requirements developed under the EMSP are in place to ensure necessary levels of medical preparedness. Oversight and medical direction of EMSP is performed by Federal Physicians placed within the HCPU as FBI Medical Officers. FBI-intrinsic medical service personnel are augmented by contracted medical professionals when deemed necessary by HCPU based upon the complexity, duration and location of an incident. Medical support is provided to several response components of the FBI responsible for conduct of these missions.</p>

Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. 
(b) QUOTE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS The quotation shall consist of two parts: (1) technical submission and (2) price information. 
Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information (including equipment drawing and complete specifications) regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. 
EVALUATION OF QUOTES Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: 
(1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the solicitation line item description, INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTERS, and EVALUATION OF QUOTES and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. 
(2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. 
The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

In addition, the following NAVSUP FLCN clauses apply;

5252.204-9400 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO FEDERALLY CONTROLLED FACILITIES AND/OR UNCLASSIFIED SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR UNCLASSIFIED IT SYSTEMS (May 2010)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.
  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.  
  
The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.
  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract.
 The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.  

Non-Sensitive Positions
Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: 

Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and 
Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access.
  

To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractors Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: 

* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions
* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
* Original Signed Release Statements

The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI.  

The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  
 
Sensitive Positions 
Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.
  To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete:

* SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
* Original Signed Release Statements 

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.

IT Systems Access
When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. 
     
When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.  


Security Approval Process
The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Commands Security Manager.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Commands Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.
  A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Commands Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.

If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract.
 

The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.  

The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.
  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.

(End of Clause)

5252.243-9400  Authorized Changes Only by the Contracting Officer (JAN 1992)
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) below, no order, statement, or conduct of Government personnel who visit the Contractor's facilities or in any other manner communicate with Contractor personnel during the performance of this contract shall constitute a change under the "Changes" clause of this contract.
(b) The Contractor shall not comply with any order, direction or request of Government personnel unless it is issued in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, or is pursuant to specific authority otherwise included as a part of this contract.
(c) The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements of this contract and notwithstanding provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer.
 In the event the Contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in charges incurred as a result thereof. The address and telephone number of the Contracting Officer is:

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200015 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-62.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:  

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET FOR REQUIREMENTS

It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Turkey.  There may be substantial travel to countries in the region if/when conditions allow.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Syria country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Middle East (ME), or his/her designee, as well as to the Chief of Mission or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Turkey, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout the region, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or designee, and is based in Turkey.  There may be substantial travel to countries in the region if/when conditions allow.  <br /> <br />The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the DCHA/OTI Syria country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Deputy Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Deputy Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Deputy Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Deputy Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative or designee in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Turkey, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout the region, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

If the lowest priced submission does not meet the technical criteria described in the solicited item description, the government reserves the right to evaluate the next lowest priced submissions until it has determined a technically acceptable submission. The evaluation will stop at the point when the government determines an offeror to be technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price, because that offer will represent the best value.

<p>Malm. I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred"E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

This synopsis is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13 for the following, under simplified acquisition procedures.

The NAICS code is 511120, Periodical Publishers.&nbsp;<strong>All qualified vendors are encouraged to respond.</strong> <br />
<p><br /><br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to establish a contract for an online subscription to UpToDate Medical Database (Brand Name or Equal) for one, 12-month base period. The online subscription shall support 93 medical officers of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The FDA requests proposal responses from qualified sources capable of providing the end-users with a vast variety of medical information that is readily available for the medical officers to use for data analysis. <br /><br />Base Period CLIN 0001 - Online subscription for 93 licenses- UpToDate (Brand Name or Equal), Period of Performance: 12 months.</p>
<p>(See attachment for subscribers' identification number)</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF NEED:<br />The medical officers in CBER review an unlimited universe of adverse event reports and have a need to analyze various types of data to answer biologics safety questions and concerns. When an adverse event is received, medical officers need access to knowledge digested by leading medical specialists. This task requires the use of various software programs. Typically, CBER medical officers need to obtain background rates of diseases in multiple populations, risk factors for disease occurrence, and classification schemes for syndromes, diagnostic options, and the latest treatments. This information forms the foundation for the interpretation of adverse events, and it is constantly changing as the volume of published medical information increases exponentially.<br />The online subscription should provide capabilities that include the following:<br />1. Clinical knowledge resource with scientific studies published in high-quality peer reviewed journals demonstrating an impact on patient safety, reduced hospital complications, improved hospital efficiency, and improved medical knowledge acquisition.<br />2. Accessible from anywhere.<br />3. Shall be an evidence-based, regularly revised, state-of-the-art, and concordant with medical professional level material. Ability for patients and doctors to actively participate in shared decision making.<br />4. Present the clinician with synthesized content: one-stop shopping for a clear and concise answer. Should not offer aggregation of many information resources such as textbooks or journals articles, leaving the clinician to choose among them.<br />5. Maintains multiple layers of redundancy to assure consistent availability with web farms located in Tokyo, Frankfurt, New York, and California (worldwide redundant servers etc.)<br />6. A fully integrated drug database, a drug-drug, drug-herb, and herb-herb interaction module and medical calculators.</p>

<p>SECTION 508 Compliance: <br />Vendor proposals shall address how the proposed solution will comply with Section 508. Specifically the following 508 Standards are applicable:<br />1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications<br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: <br />The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer is the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price (inclusive of options) meeting or exceeding the non-cost factor (technical conformance to the requirements of the solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions. The offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the best interest of the Government; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Features Meeting/Exceeding Salient Requirements (Brand Name or Equal) <br />2. Total Price (all CLINs shall be priced)</p>

<p>Volume I - Technical</p>
<p>Volume II - Pricing Proposal</p>
<p>The completion and submission of the above items will constitute an offer (proposal) and will indicate the offeror's unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this RFP and any attachments hereto. Alternate proposals are not authorized. Objections to any terms and conditions of the RFP will constitute deficiency, which may render the offer unacceptable.</p>
<p><br />Volume I - Technical:</p>

If an equal product is proposed, offeror shall demonstrate how that product is equal to the brand name product. Offerors shall demonstrate in sufficient detail that the proposed solution will successfully meet the requirements of the salient characteristics. For purposes of clarification, offerors are encouraged to provide trial access to their products to demonstrate how the requirements of the salient characteristics will be met.</p>
<p>Volume II - Pricing:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>

<DESC>RFP 225198 <br />One X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />November 21, 2012
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (XSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered XSAPRs and the new XSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as XSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the XSAPR-2 and the associated infrastructure to install XSAPR-2 at the ARM site on Graciosa Island in the Azores.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed in the Azores, Portugal.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Please be advised.  The announcement has been revised to edit the material in Section 5, Capability Statement, and to change the due date and cut off date for quesitons.  Please make a note of these changes.
This market survey is being reissued because of a change in the size standard for the applicable NAICS code.   For code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, the small business size limit is now $14 million dollars of average annual revenue.  
From time to time, the Office of Airport Planning and Programming requires consultant or contract services to perform functions that are beyond the resources or capacity of in house FAA personnel.  The Office of Airport Planning and Programming establishes policies, standards and guidance in support of airport planning and environmental processing, and administers the FAA's financial assistance programsthe Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) programs.  There is a high degree of overlap and interrelationship among these three areas, as well as interaction with other parts of the Office of Airports and other parts of the FAA. 
Therefore, the FAA is considering procuring an indefinite-quantity, indefinite delivery consultant contract to support these requirements if and when they arise.

<DESC>This is an amendment to Solicitation Number NNH13ZDA002L, Request for Information Concepts for Applications of Large Space Optics, formerly posted on November 27, 2012. Potential responders to the original RFI should take note of the following revisions and clarifications: (1)	The scope of admissible astrophysics objectives is expanded such that only objectives of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) stipulated in the 2010 National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey are excluded. Thus, the goal statement in the original Solicitation is amended to read: The goal of the overall study is to gather and assess concepts for possible utilization of the recently acquired systems for Agency goals aligned with five principal areas: space technology, human exploration and operations, heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics (excluding objectives aligned with those recommended by the NRC 2010 astrophysics decadal survey for the proposed WFIRST observatory). (2)	All abstract submissions must be in English. NASA has posted Agency goals, guidance and technical information about the space optics systems at the SALSO website, http://science.nasa.gov/salso/	.  Complete information on submission of concepts and other details regarding SALSO activities are also posted at this site.  Respondents and other interested persons should check the site often for pertinent information and updates.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Patuxent River, MD</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>This justification and approval authorizes and approves on a sole source basis a Cost Plus Fixed Fee bridge contract to existing task order M802 under contract N00178-04-D-4016. This contract will allow for the continuity of critical support for test planning, test execution, data analysis and reporting in support of the sensor systems area of the Mission Systems Test and Evaluation Division (5.1.2).</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The purpose of this bridge it to provide up to an additional 12 months of continued support for engineering and testing of the sensor systems of multiple aircraft including aircraft weapon systems. This 12 month period will consist of a base period of six (6) months, with three (3), two (2) month option periods for a total period of performance from 15 November 2012 to 14 November 2013.</p>
<p>See Appendix A for Estimated Dollar Value</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>The existing contract/task order for engineering and testing of sensor systems for the Mission Systems Test and Evaluation Division (5.1.2) of the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) at Patuxent River, MD was competitively awarded to ARINC Engineering Services, LLC, under Seaport-e contract N00178-04-D-4016-M802. The incumbent, ARINC, has</p>
<p><br />successfully provided a full range of engineering and technical support services under the current contract for the past 5 years. Performance by ARINC during this twelve month bridge will be seamless and without delay. Subsequently, ARINC is the only company capable of supplying the short term support within the timeframe allotted. ARINC has the available resources in place and is ready to potentially continue program execution through 14 November 2013, which will also allow sufficient time for a reasonable transition period, if necessary. Additionally, awarding a bridge contract to other than the incumbent would result in an excessive delay and perhaps a loss of continuity in services.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>A synopsis for the proposed contract was posted to the FEDBIZOPS website on 17 July 2012 and closed on 31 July 2012. Only ARINC expressed an interest in this requirement. However, market research conducted within the Seaport-e environment for the follow-on effort determined there are multiple vendors capable of providing the required services and they will have the opportunity to compete for the follow-on task order on a full and open basis. Awarding this limited-time extension to allow a complete and vigorous competition is in the best interest of both the Navy and industry and promotes the maximum fair competition opportunity for the long-term contract.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Officer shall ensure that all supplies and services provided under this bridge contract are procured at a fair and reasonable price. The Contractor will submit a formal price proposal with certified cost or pricing data and sufficient information to support the accuracy and reliability of the estimate. After receipt, the proposal from ARINC will be reviewed by experienced technical analysts, cost analysts and contract specialists with the aid of necessary field pricing support. The Contracting Officer will utilize cost and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>The PCO is not aware of any barriers to future competition. The follow-on requirement is currently being competed and is anticipated to be awarded in the 3rd Quarter of FY13. This sole source bridge contract will provide coverage from the end of the current Seaport-e task order N00178-04-D-4016-M802 to the award date of the follow-on procurement. This extension will promote the maximum competitive opportunity for industry to complete teaming and subcontracting arrangements, providing a best value solution to the Navy while preventing a lapse of the critical simulator support services required by the Mission Systems Test and Evaluation Division.</p>
