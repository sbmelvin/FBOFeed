This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov, in order to be considered for award.<br />This combined synopsis solicitation notice is a request for competitive proposals. This requirement is for pharmaceutical and medical/surgical supplies and may result in the award of one or more Fixed Price Contracts. The term of the resulting contract(s) shall be four (4) months from the effective date of the contract. A Government review of performance will be performed through CPARS. CPARS is the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System that reports to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) which provides timely and relevant information on Contractor performance for use in source selection. The anticipated Period of Performance for this requirement is September 15, 2014 thru December 31, 2014.<br />Attachment A - RFP 2014-N-16606 attached to this notice is a listing of the supplies required broken down by: Pharmaceutical &amp; MedSurge requirements and Dimensions.

Line item numbers 1-107 are the supplies/pharmaceuticals required to address this requirement and are under the Pharma &amp; MedSurge tab. The Dimensions tab contains the dimensions required for packaging described in the solicitation below. The spreadsheets have been left unlocked to allow vendors to copy portions of the spreadsheet and create their own. If you have an alternate NDC#, Manufacturer #, UOM, Eaches, or dimension, please reflect such in your proposal and on a spreadsheet. The alternate proposal should be easily recognizable and well defined. Offerors are not required to propose on all line items in order to be considered for award, however the Government will consider additional administrative costs in its price evaluation. The part numbers, where identified, are provided for specification purposes and responses may be either for the specified product or equal item.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.    <br>      <br>   Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command   <br>   Office of Command Counsel   <br>   4400 Martin Road   <br>   Rm: A6SE040.001   <br>   Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000   <br>   Fax: (256) 450-8840    <br>      <br>   Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to:    <br>   Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command   <br>   Office of Command Counsel   <br>   4400 Martin Road   <br>   Rm: A6SE040.001   <br>   Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000   <br>   Fax: (256) 450-8840    <br>      <br>   The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.    <br>      <br>   If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures.   <br>      <br>   (End of Clause)   <br>      <br>   (xiv) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract as a result of this solicitation.   <br>      <br>   (xv) Proposals are due at 11:00 AM Eastern Time, Tuesday, 7 October 2014.

Each contract awarded under the IDIQ contract will share the total contract capacity estimated at 24,900,000,000 Yen over the five year period. The estimated minimum size of a task order is 100,000,000 Yen. The estimated maximum size of a task order is 7,500,000,000 Yen with the average size task order being approximately 2,000,000,000 Yen. Companies must have ability to perform up to a minimum of five (5) task orders simultaneously.     <br>        <br>    Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis.     <br>        <br>    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.
